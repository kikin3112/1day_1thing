Objective. To determine the role of entrepreneurism within the broader missions of schools of phar- macy and develop an educational framework to produce pharmacist entrepreneurs. Methods. Following a systematic review and six semi-structured interviews, a three-round Delphi process was conducted with an expert panel comprised of successful entrepreneurs, pharmacy faculty members and administrators, students, and community members. Participants were asked about the role of entrepreneurship in a pharmacy school’s mission, how they would deﬁne a pharmacist entre- preneur, and to identify the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) expected to be successful as a pharmacist entrepreneur. A model for entrepreneur education was also developed in accordance withBloom’s taxonomy. Participant agreement and rankings were reported. Results. Based on the semi-structured interviews and the results from the Delphi process, the following framework for a pharmacist entrepreneur was proposed along with a list of KSAs: identiﬁes, creates, and pursues new opportunities; successfully implements new ideas into practice; is willing to take risks; ﬁlls unmet needs; creates new value through innovation; is responsive to change; makes sacri- ﬁces; includes social and intrapreneurship; leverages existing knowledge, skills, and resources; goes beyond traditional roles for pharmacists; and improves patient care. Recommendations for entrepre- neurship instruction, guided by Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive processes, were created. Conclusion. According to our expert
by Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive processes, were created. Conclusion. According to our expert panel, a pharmacist entrepreneur combines several characteristics identiﬁed with a more traditional entrepreneur construct with the characteristics of an individual de- voted to achieving outcomes beyond one’s personal gain. Additional research to inform implementa-tion and assessment of entrepreneurship within pharmacy curricula would provide more speciﬁc guidance for instructional design and accreditation evaluations. Keywords: entrepreneur, knowledge, skills, attitudes, taxonomy INTRODUCTION What makes a pharmacist entrepreneur? We pose this question through the lens of pharmacy educators tasked with preparing future generations of pharmacists in accordance with the standards set by the AccreditationCouncil for Pharmacy Education (ACPE). 1One of the recommendations of the American Associations of Col- leges of Pharmacy’s (AACP) Academic Affairs Standing Committee was for the association to convene a “task force to develop outcomes related to traits in the affective domain such as self-efﬁcacy, self-assessment, reﬂection, entrepreneurship, leadership and advocacy.”2The Centerfor the Advancement of Pharmacy Education (CAPE) subsequently developed a fourth iteration of educational outcomes created to guide curricular discussions for Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) programs that includes “Innovation and Entrepreneurship” within the new af- fective domain captured in Standard 4.3As the Standards were updated, disagreement and controversy surrounding the instruction and assessment of outcomes for the traits identiﬁed in the affective domain have surfaced in the form of public criticisms from faculty, administrators,and students. 4-6Without agreement on a pharmacist en- trepreneur deﬁnition and the knowledge, skills, and atti- tudes (KSAs) expected of graduates from accredited institutions, it is impossible to fairly assess schools and colleges of pharmacy on performance.

identify speciﬁc KSAs to help guide instructional design and terminal learning objectives for this affective domain trait. METHODS This study incorporated a multi-step process (Figure 1) to gather information from different sources to inform the ﬁnal pharmacist entrepreneur framework. A systematic literature review was conducted using SCOPUS, EMBASE, and PubMed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guide- lines previously published.7In addition to the systematic review, semi-structured interviews were conducted with six pharmacy-related entrepreneurs to inform the initial round of the Delphi process. The six experts chosen for the in-depth interviews were not included in 30 invited panelists for the Delphi process. In-depth interviews were conducted to help obtain a clearer understanding of the subject, determine areas to investigate, and inform the initial Delphi panel ques- tionnaire. Semi-structured open-ended questions were used for maximum probing of issues, perspectives, and concepts about the role of entrepreneurship in pharmacy education and the skills necessary to be a successful pharmacist entrepreneur. Interviews were conducted in- person and via telephone in order to maximize rapport andfacilitate candor. The experts invited to participate were identified from multiple sources including a recent pub- lication of profiles of pharmacy entrepreneurs, the Uni- versity of Maryland Board of Visitors, and through networks established by the University of Maryland’s Associate Dean of Development and Alumni Affairs. 8 These experts were chosen on the basis of lived experienceleading new business development in a pharmacy-related ﬁeld. Audio recordings were collected and transcribedthrough Rev (San Francisco, CA), with advance permis- sion from the subject to ensure that answers were clear, unambiguous, and recorded correctly. Subjects were able to review the ﬁnal transcripts for accuracy before ﬁnal analysis.
correctly. Subjects were able to review the ﬁnal transcripts for accuracy before ﬁnal analysis. Interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis from a grounded theory approach, a ﬂexible method which identiﬁes commonalities and differences inqualitative data clustered around themes derived directly from the text in the transcripts. 9,10 The panel was comprised of a heterogeneous group of pharmacy school stakeholders with an interest in achieving the study purpose: pharmacy school in- structors, faculty members, and administrators with aspecial interest or expertise in entrepreneurial education; pharmacy students or recent graduates; and patients or community members. Panelists were identified through literature searches, pharmacy organization networks, re- ferrals from people initially contacted, and the research team’s network from previous work on entrepreneurship. The research team sought diversity in experiences and proﬁles but did not specify a minimum proportion for each stakeholder group or demographic characteristic.However, given the relevance of the study aims to in- structional design and sourcing of experts from peer- reviewed literature, the research team relied more heavily on panelists representing the ﬁrst category (instructors, faculty members, and administrators with a special in- terest or expertise in entrepreneurial education). Panelists maintained full anonymity so that comments could be made freely without attribution. A minimum panel re- sponse rate for a completed round was set at a two-thirds majority, or 20 of the 30 invited panelists. The first Delphi round was used to develop the initial base of knowledge, focused on open-ended questions informed by the literature review and pre- liminary interviews. Round 1 included optional de- mographic questions as well as a request for permission to acknowledge the individuals by name in the final manuscript. Panelists were asked to define a pharmacist entrepreneur, describe how
in the final manuscript. Panelists were asked to define a pharmacist entrepreneur, describe how entrepreneurship fits within the mission and vision of schools of pharmacy, discuss the most effective methods of teaching entrepreneur-ship, and identify fundamental KSAs for pharmacist entrepreneurs. Themes from round 1 were developed independently by two authors and coded using NVivo, version 12 (QSR International Pty Ltd., Burlington, MA). Once an agreement with the themes was reached, statements were formed and a round 2 questionnaire was developed. Figure 1. Framework for a Research Study on Entrepreneurship in Pharmacy Education that Included a Systematic Review, Structured Interviews, and a Delphi ProcessAmerican Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 2019; 83 (10) Article 7548. 2195
The second round of Likert-type questions sought panel agreement with each statement, with an a priori agreement level set at $75%. Statements in the second round were grouped into the deﬁnition of a pharmacist entrepreneur, the importance of entrepreneurship in the mission and vision of a school, the importance of entre-preneurship in a pharmacy school’s curriculum, effective approaches for teaching entrepreneurship to pharmacy students, the fundamental KSA’s identiﬁed, and a pro- posed taxonomy for pharmacy entrepreneurship educa- tion developed from Bloom’s taxonomy framework. 11,12 Statements that reached panel agreement in round 2 were carried forward. In the third round, panelists were asked to rank each item within each category. Mean ranking and level of agreement for quantitative rankingswere assessed using Kendall’s coefﬁcient of concordance calculated in RStudio, Version 1.1.383 (RStudio, Inc., Boston, MA). RESULTS Six expert pharmacy-related entrepreneurs agreed to 60-90 minute in-person or telephonic interviews between May and August 2018. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and reviewed by each expert prior to quali- tative analysis for accuracy. Only one of the transcribed interviews received edits pertaining to the spelling ofnames, but no other content was revised. The themes that emerged pertaining to the role of entrepreneurship in pharmacy education included the future of pharmacy, pharmacy horizons beyond traditional roles, the impor- tance of inclusion in the mission and vision of a school of pharmacy, creating an entrepreneurial culture, and social entrepreneurism. Educational approach themes included systematic inclusion in the curriculum, exposure to other industries or disciplines, mentoring opportunities, andintended recruitment and selection of students and faculty members interested in entrepreneurship. Specific skills desired in an entrepreneur as determined by the experts were categorized as business management, accounting,
an entrepreneur as determined by the experts were categorized as business management, accounting, marketing ideas, specialization or niche development, creativity, innovation, networking, and risk management. Additionally, themes for the personal characteristics of an entrepreneur emerged, including curiosity, motivation, personal life balance, and readiness. Following Delphi panel recruitment, 29 (97%) of the 30 panelists who initially agreed to serve on the panelresponded to the round 1 survey. The panel included 16 (55%) men and 13 (45%) women with an average age of 47 years ( 611 years). The open responses produced 15 statements pertaining to the deﬁnition of a pharmacist entrepreneur, three statements for the importance of en- trepreneurship in a school’s mission and vision, fourstatements related to entrepreneurship in the curriculum, six approaches for teaching entrepreneurship, and lists for potential KSAs (Tables 2 and 3). From the open re- sponses, the study team created statements applicable to each of the cognitive process dimensions of Bloom’s taxonomy (Figure 1). Round 2 sought agreement from the panel on all of the statements, identified KSAs, and proposed taxonomy for pharmacist entrepreneur education. With 25 (83%) participants responding, at least 19 of the 25 participants were required to agree or strongly agree to achieve the$75% threshold determined a priori . Agreement was achieved for all items in the proposed taxonomy (Figure 1) at a level of 88% or higher. Items that failed to reach the predetermined agreement threshold are identiﬁed in Table2 and Table 3. None of the statements pertaining to en- trepreneurship in the school’s mission and vision and the importance of entrepreneurship in the curriculum achieved the desired level of agreement. As in round 2, 25 (83%) of the 30 invited participants responded to the round 3 questionnaire, which focused on ranking each of the items within each category. Full rankings for items within the
which focused on ranking each of the items within each category. Full rankings for items within the educational approach, knowledge, skills, and attitudes categories are listed in Table 4. Ranking order for the educational approach statements were better correlated than the KSA rankings,but still between “weak” and “moderate” levels for ranking consensus. 13 DISCUSSION Defining a Pharmacist Entrepreneur According to our expert panel, a pharmacist entre- preneur combines several characteristics identified with a more traditional entrepreneur construct with the charac- teristics of an individual devoted to achieving outcomes beyond his or her personal gain.

dimensions: autonomy, innovativeness, risk-taking, pro- activity, and competitive aggressiveness.14The pharma- cist entrepreneur deﬁnition proposed as a result of thisstudy (Figure 3) captures four of those ﬁve domains, onlyomitting competitive aggressiveness. Competitive ag- gressiveness refers to an entrepreneur directly challeng- ing others in a marketplace to gain position or marketshare. 14While not included in our ﬁnal deﬁnition, prin- ciples of strategy related to market analysis and compe-tition were identiﬁed by our panel as essential knowledge and skills needed for a pharmacist entrepreneur. The 2010-2011 AACP Academic Affairs Standing Committee described the entrepreneurship trait as one that revolves around taking on the risks and responsibilities as-sociated with implementing innovations. 15Additionally, the committee considered critical thinking and problem- solving foundational components and cited Rubino and Freshman’s eight entrepreneurship competency clusters(decision making, strategic thinking, risk-taking, conﬁdencebuilding, communicating ideas, motivating team members, tolerance of ambiguity and internal locus of control) as potential areas for development for pharmacist entrepre-neurs. 15,16The CAPE’s 2013 Educational Outcomesreinforced Rubino and Freshman’s competency clusters and further speciﬁed entrepreneurship recommendations to “engage in innovative activities by using creative thinking to envision better ways of accomplishing professional goals.”3 This study’s proposed deﬁnition of a pharmacist entrepre-neur encompasses the CAPE recommendation and expands the construct to give pharmacy educators more guidance. Approaches Effective for Entrepreneurship Education Our expert panel ranked a mix ed instructional approach (didactic and experiential) as th e most important process for educating pharmacist entrepren eurs.

Additionally, the panel found value in proactively targeting stu dents with greater interests in entrepreneurship with more ad vanced elective opportunities. Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes This study adds a comprehensive list of KSAs ranked in order of importance for pharmacy educators to consider during the instructional design process (Table 4).

ability to communicate effectively (oral, written, and in- terpersonal) was ranked the most important item identi- ﬁed both as knowledge and a skill. This supports the use of written and oral presentations throughout the curriculum and may demonstrate how many other pharmacy courses indirectly beneﬁt the future pharmacist entrepreneur. De- veloping a business plan was also ranked highly as founda- tional knowledge and a skill. Schools may consider engaging with the National Community Pharmacists Association for guidance related to business plan development given the organization’s history of running a national business plan competition speciﬁcally for student members.17 Several foundational knowledge areas overlap with the knowledge students should be gaining in existing pharmacy management courses. These areas relate to items often taught in masters programs in business management such as strat- egy, project management, finance, accounting, marketing, and human resource management. Dual PharmD/Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs capture these topic areas in more depth, but our panel did not explicitly recommend that the pharmacist entrepreneur have an MBAor equivalent education. Previous research related to dual PharmD/MBA degree-earning students found that the ma- jority of graduates entered the pharmaceutical industry, chain pharmacy, hospital/institutional, or managed care pharmacy. 18Business management programs may be helpful to gain the foundational knowledge and skills fre- quently identiﬁed with entrepreneurs, but evidence from a sample of these dual degree stu dents suggests the motivation stems from a desire to be more competitive in an existing job market rather than to create new business opportunities.19 Leadership was also identified as foundational knowledge as well as a skill necessary for entrepreneurs, which CAPE identified in its own subsection of the 2013 Educational Outcomes.3Our panel found several char- acteristics typically
subsection of the 2013 Educational Outcomes.3Our panel found several char- acteristics typically identiﬁed with multiple leadership frameworks important for entrepreneurs. Items such as adaptability, self-assessment, dealing with failure, and communication are all consistent with different models of leadership.20,21Other items identiﬁed such as health system literacy and pharmacy core sciences demonstratehow being competent in pharmacy is necessary (by deﬁ- nition) to be a successful pharmacist entrepreneur.In terms of attitudes, the concept of failure may be closely tied to several highly ranked characteristics for a pharmacist entrepreneur. Resiliency, determination, positivity, and risk-taking were the four most important attitudes identified in this study, which may all be linked to different stages of (before, during, and after) failure. During the semi-structured interviews and round 1 open response analysis, several experts recognized the ability to bounce back from failure as a critical attitude for any future entrepreneur. Our experts recognized failure as part of the process and being resilient to failure as a necessity. If the potential for failure is viewed through an optimisticlens, then one may be more predisposed to greater risk- taking. Gaining experience through failure (or multiple failures) may be valuable for the pharmacist entrepreneur, however, the pharmacy education apparatus does not support this type of learning. An old adage, “C equals PharmD,” has been passed down to many students over the past two decades. This embodies the notion that anything but failure within the formal curriculum of a school of pharmacy will be rewarded with the doctoralhood. Failure within a single pharmacy class may lead to the probation or expulsion of a student as they have not demonstrated the mastery of the course objectives deemed necessary to eventually become a pharmacist. One could argue that the environment created to educate pharmacists to meet the
a pharmacist. One could argue that the environment created to educate pharmacists to meet the competency standards to practice pharmacy directly inhibits the growth of an environment that en- courages a “try-fail-and-try-again” approach. We are not advocating or encouraging student failures in core phar- macy classes, but simply calling for more opportunities embedded throughout the curriculum where students mayexperiment with new ideas without the fear that failure could end (or stall) their pharmacy career. Entrepreneurship Education for Pharmacists Ap- plied to Bloom’s Taxonomy For schools and colleges of pharmacy considering curricular development or integration of entrepreneurship education, we propose a framework combining the cog- nitive processes identified in Bloom’s taxonomy withspeciﬁc application to entrepreneurship (Figure 2). As faculty develop instructional plans, we recommend usingTable 4.

didactic lectures to cover foundational knowledge com- ponents (remember function of Bloom’s taxonomy) and to explain the role of pharmacy within the broader context of healthcare so that students may begin to identify areas of unmet need (understand function). Within these di- dactic classes, we recommend incorporating structured exercises that allow students to use the newly acquired knowledge in new settings, forcing them to propose aninnovative solution to a problem (apply function). Team- based activities may be preferred for these structured activities based on the feedback from our Delphi study. Examinations may be helpful to assess how well students are able to differentiate between strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for a given business proposal (analyze function) and to critique the value proposition ofthe business idea (evaluate function). While on rotation or through other experiential opportunities (summer in- ternship or fellowship), students should be tasked with activities that cover the apply, analyze, and evaluate functions. Depending on the length of the experience, the students may have the opportunity to help preceptors design, develop, and implement a new business idea that adds value to patient care, practice, or the pharmacyprofession (create function). It may be difﬁcult for most students to reach the create function while in pharmacy school, because implementation of the business plan may be time consuming for a full-time student. Engaging in business plan competitions or other proposal develop- ment activities may help capture the rest of the create domain; however, students must recognize that more Figure 2.

learning will be achieved through doing or executing the plan. Place in the Strategic Plan and Curriculum Given our higher threshold for panel agreement, none of the statements developed from our Delphi relatedto the importance of entrepreneurship inclusion in a school’s mission or curriculum reached $75%. While multiple items did meet a $50% threshold, these state- ments clearly did not resonate with everyone on the panel. During the six in-depth interviews with experienced en- trepreneurs, the consensus was that entrepreneurship was vital to a school’s mission and vision as the interviewees felt that entrepreneurship would be necessary for the profession to survive and advance. While this sentimentwas shared by several Delphi panel members, there was still hesitancy to make a ﬁrm statement that entrepre- neurship should be an integral part of a school’s strategic plan. We recommend that deans, faculty members, stu- dents, and other key institutional stakeholders consider how the entrepreneurship construct may ﬁt within their current educational environment before making it a for- mal component of the school’s mission and vision. Con- sidering the ACPE Standards, schools must address entrepreneurship within the curriculum to meet Standard 4, but our study reveals that several experts are not onboard with the notion that entrepreneurship must be in the curriculum for a PharmD program. 1,3We recommend further discussion at the AACP-level to hear dissenting opinions or concerns with curricular inclusion. In a Delphi process, the selection of appropriate ex- perts may be the most challenging step that researchers must consider in terms of bias.22We focused on suc- cessful entrepreneurs for the semi-structured in-depth interviews to build the ﬁrst round of the Delphi, but thenwe purposefully recruited a large proportion of panelists with direct ties to academia as an instructor or adminis- trator (62%) who had demonstrated interest in entrepre- neurship education. While
or adminis- trator (62%) who had demonstrated interest in entrepre- neurship education. While we felt this was appropriate to gain the opinions of pharmacy educators, results may have been different if we had focused solely on recruiting a panel of experienced entrepreneurs. Another limitation of our Delphi process involves the more stringent deﬁ- nition of panel agreement at $75%. This deﬁnition was chosen to be more selective and to include only the items where a supermajority agreed, but it is important forreaders to consider those items in Tables 2 and 3 that were mentioned by multiple panelists but failed to meet the a priori threshold. For example, attitudes representing empathy, humility, altruism, and cultural sensitivity were mentioned during the in-depth interviews as well as the ﬁrst Delphi round, but were not included in the ﬁnal set. Ifwe had focused our Delphi recruitment solely on social entrepreneurs, we believe that these attitudes would have been more widely accepted. We have presented all items for the sake of transparency as well as to encourage other researchers to explore whether constructs with less agreement in our panel should be examined further. CONCLUSION Through semi-structured interviews with experi- enced entrepreneurs and a multi-round Delphi process, a framework for entrepreneurship education applied to pharmacy was proposed along with an extensive list of KSAs expected for successful pharmacist entrepreneurs. The panel also produced a consensus definition of a “pharmacist entrepreneur” to help guide both accreditors and schools as they work to address the requirementsfor formal evaluation and quality improvement of instructional design. Additional research to inform implementation and assessment of entrepreneurship within pharmacy curricula would provide more spe- ciﬁc guidance for instructional design and accreditation evaluations.

RESEARCH Pharmapreneur – Deﬁning a Framework for Entrepreneurship in Pharmacy Education T. Joseph Mattingly II, PharmD, MBA, PhD,a,bMoaz Abdelwadoud, MD,aC. Daniel Mullins, PhD,a Natalie D. Eddington, PhDa aUniversity of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, Maryland bEditorial Board Member, American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education , Arlington, Virginia Submitted February 6, 2019; accepted May 7, 2019; published December 2019. Objective. To determine the role of entrepreneurism within the broader missions of schools of phar- macy and develop an educational framework to produce pharmacist entrepreneurs. Methods. Following a systematic review and six semi-structured interviews, a three-round Delphi process was conducted with an expert panel comprised of successful entrepreneurs, pharmacy faculty members and administrators, students, and community members. Participants were asked about the role of entrepreneurship in a pharmacy school’s mission, how they would deﬁne a pharmacist entre- preneur, and to identify the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) expected to be successful as a pharmacist entrepreneur. A model for entrepreneur education was also developed in accordance withBloom’s taxonomy. Participant agreement and rankings were reported. Results. Based on the semi-structured interviews and the results from the Delphi process, the following framework for a pharmacist entrepreneur was proposed along with a list of KSAs: identiﬁes, creates, and pursues new opportunities; successfully implements new ideas into practice; is willing to take risks; ﬁlls unmet needs; creates new value through innovation; is responsive to change; makes sacri- ﬁces; includes social and intrapreneurship; leverages existing knowledge, skills, and resources; goes beyond traditional roles for pharmacists; and improves patient care. Recommendations for entrepre- neurship instruction, guided by Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive processes, were created. Conclusion. According to our expert
by Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive processes, were created. Conclusion. According to our expert panel, a pharmacist entrepreneur combines several characteristics identiﬁed with a more traditional entrepreneur construct with the characteristics of an individual de- voted to achieving outcomes beyond one’s personal gain. Additional research to inform implementa-tion and assessment of entrepreneurship within pharmacy curricula would provide more speciﬁc guidance for instructional design and accreditation evaluations. Keywords: entrepreneur, knowledge, skills, attitudes, taxonomy INTRODUCTION What makes a pharmacist entrepreneur? We pose this question through the lens of pharmacy educators tasked with preparing future generations of pharmacists in accordance with the standards set by the AccreditationCouncil for Pharmacy Education (ACPE). 1One of the recommendations of the American Associations of Col- leges of Pharmacy’s (AACP) Academic Affairs Standing Committee was for the association to convene a “task force to develop outcomes related to traits in the affective domain such as self-efﬁcacy, self-assessment, reﬂection, entrepreneurship, leadership and advocacy.”2The Centerfor the Advancement of Pharmacy Education (CAPE) subsequently developed a fourth iteration of educational outcomes created to guide curricular discussions for Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) programs that includes “Innovation and Entrepreneurship” within the new af- fective domain captured in Standard 4.3As the Standards were updated, disagreement and controversy surrounding the instruction and assessment of outcomes for the traits identiﬁed in the affective domain have surfaced in the form of public criticisms from faculty, administrators,and students. 4-6Without agreement on a pharmacist en- trepreneur deﬁnition and the knowledge, skills, and atti- tudes (KSAs) expected of graduates from accredited institutions, it is impossible to fairly assess schools and colleges of pharmacy on performance.

identify speciﬁc KSAs to help guide instructional design and terminal learning objectives for this affective domain trait. METHODS This study incorporated a multi-step process (Figure 1) to gather information from different sources to inform the ﬁnal pharmacist entrepreneur framework. A systematic literature review was conducted using SCOPUS, EMBASE, and PubMed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guide- lines previously published.7In addition to the systematic review, semi-structured interviews were conducted with six pharmacy-related entrepreneurs to inform the initial round of the Delphi process. The six experts chosen for the in-depth interviews were not included in 30 invited panelists for the Delphi process. In-depth interviews were conducted to help obtain a clearer understanding of the subject, determine areas to investigate, and inform the initial Delphi panel ques- tionnaire. Semi-structured open-ended questions were used for maximum probing of issues, perspectives, and concepts about the role of entrepreneurship in pharmacy education and the skills necessary to be a successful pharmacist entrepreneur. Interviews were conducted in- person and via telephone in order to maximize rapport andfacilitate candor. The experts invited to participate were identified from multiple sources including a recent pub- lication of profiles of pharmacy entrepreneurs, the Uni- versity of Maryland Board of Visitors, and through networks established by the University of Maryland’s Associate Dean of Development and Alumni Affairs. 8 These experts were chosen on the basis of lived experienceleading new business development in a pharmacy-related ﬁeld. Audio recordings were collected and transcribedthrough Rev (San Francisco, CA), with advance permis- sion from the subject to ensure that answers were clear, unambiguous, and recorded correctly. Subjects were able to review the ﬁnal transcripts for accuracy before ﬁnal analysis.
correctly. Subjects were able to review the ﬁnal transcripts for accuracy before ﬁnal analysis. Interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis from a grounded theory approach, a ﬂexible method which identiﬁes commonalities and differences inqualitative data clustered around themes derived directly from the text in the transcripts. 9,10 The panel was comprised of a heterogeneous group of pharmacy school stakeholders with an interest in achieving the study purpose: pharmacy school in- structors, faculty members, and administrators with aspecial interest or expertise in entrepreneurial education; pharmacy students or recent graduates; and patients or community members. Panelists were identified through literature searches, pharmacy organization networks, re- ferrals from people initially contacted, and the research team’s network from previous work on entrepreneurship. The research team sought diversity in experiences and proﬁles but did not specify a minimum proportion for each stakeholder group or demographic characteristic.However, given the relevance of the study aims to in- structional design and sourcing of experts from peer- reviewed literature, the research team relied more heavily on panelists representing the ﬁrst category (instructors, faculty members, and administrators with a special in- terest or expertise in entrepreneurial education). Panelists maintained full anonymity so that comments could be made freely without attribution. A minimum panel re- sponse rate for a completed round was set at a two-thirds majority, or 20 of the 30 invited panelists. The first Delphi round was used to develop the initial base of knowledge, focused on open-ended questions informed by the literature review and pre- liminary interviews. Round 1 included optional de- mographic questions as well as a request for permission to acknowledge the individuals by name in the final manuscript. Panelists were asked to define a pharmacist entrepreneur, describe how
in the final manuscript. Panelists were asked to define a pharmacist entrepreneur, describe how entrepreneurship fits within the mission and vision of schools of pharmacy, discuss the most effective methods of teaching entrepreneur-ship, and identify fundamental KSAs for pharmacist entrepreneurs. Themes from round 1 were developed independently by two authors and coded using NVivo, version 12 (QSR International Pty Ltd., Burlington, MA). Once an agreement with the themes was reached, statements were formed and a round 2 questionnaire was developed. Figure 1. Framework for a Research Study on Entrepreneurship in Pharmacy Education that Included a Systematic Review, Structured Interviews, and a Delphi ProcessAmerican Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 2019; 83 (10) Article 7548. 2195
The second round of Likert-type questions sought panel agreement with each statement, with an a priori agreement level set at $75%. Statements in the second round were grouped into the deﬁnition of a pharmacist entrepreneur, the importance of entrepreneurship in the mission and vision of a school, the importance of entre-preneurship in a pharmacy school’s curriculum, effective approaches for teaching entrepreneurship to pharmacy students, the fundamental KSA’s identiﬁed, and a pro- posed taxonomy for pharmacy entrepreneurship educa- tion developed from Bloom’s taxonomy framework. 11,12 Statements that reached panel agreement in round 2 were carried forward. In the third round, panelists were asked to rank each item within each category. Mean ranking and level of agreement for quantitative rankingswere assessed using Kendall’s coefﬁcient of concordance calculated in RStudio, Version 1.1.383 (RStudio, Inc., Boston, MA). RESULTS Six expert pharmacy-related entrepreneurs agreed to 60-90 minute in-person or telephonic interviews between May and August 2018. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and reviewed by each expert prior to quali- tative analysis for accuracy. Only one of the transcribed interviews received edits pertaining to the spelling ofnames, but no other content was revised. The themes that emerged pertaining to the role of entrepreneurship in pharmacy education included the future of pharmacy, pharmacy horizons beyond traditional roles, the impor- tance of inclusion in the mission and vision of a school of pharmacy, creating an entrepreneurial culture, and social entrepreneurism. Educational approach themes included systematic inclusion in the curriculum, exposure to other industries or disciplines, mentoring opportunities, andintended recruitment and selection of students and faculty members interested in entrepreneurship. Specific skills desired in an entrepreneur as determined by the experts were categorized as business management, accounting,
an entrepreneur as determined by the experts were categorized as business management, accounting, marketing ideas, specialization or niche development, creativity, innovation, networking, and risk management. Additionally, themes for the personal characteristics of an entrepreneur emerged, including curiosity, motivation, personal life balance, and readiness. Following Delphi panel recruitment, 29 (97%) of the 30 panelists who initially agreed to serve on the panelresponded to the round 1 survey. The panel included 16 (55%) men and 13 (45%) women with an average age of 47 years ( 611 years). The open responses produced 15 statements pertaining to the deﬁnition of a pharmacist entrepreneur, three statements for the importance of en- trepreneurship in a school’s mission and vision, fourstatements related to entrepreneurship in the curriculum, six approaches for teaching entrepreneurship, and lists for potential KSAs (Tables 2 and 3). From the open re- sponses, the study team created statements applicable to each of the cognitive process dimensions of Bloom’s taxonomy (Figure 1). Round 2 sought agreement from the panel on all of the statements, identified KSAs, and proposed taxonomy for pharmacist entrepreneur education. With 25 (83%) participants responding, at least 19 of the 25 participants were required to agree or strongly agree to achieve the$75% threshold determined a priori . Agreement was achieved for all items in the proposed taxonomy (Figure 1) at a level of 88% or higher. Items that failed to reach the predetermined agreement threshold are identiﬁed in Table2 and Table 3. None of the statements pertaining to en- trepreneurship in the school’s mission and vision and the importance of entrepreneurship in the curriculum achieved the desired level of agreement. As in round 2, 25 (83%) of the 30 invited participants responded to the round 3 questionnaire, which focused on ranking each of the items within each category. Full rankings for items within the
which focused on ranking each of the items within each category. Full rankings for items within the educational approach, knowledge, skills, and attitudes categories are listed in Table 4. Ranking order for the educational approach statements were better correlated than the KSA rankings,but still between “weak” and “moderate” levels for ranking consensus. 13 DISCUSSION Defining a Pharmacist Entrepreneur According to our expert panel, a pharmacist entre- preneur combines several characteristics identified with a more traditional entrepreneur construct with the charac- teristics of an individual devoted to achieving outcomes beyond his or her personal gain.

dimensions: autonomy, innovativeness, risk-taking, pro- activity, and competitive aggressiveness.14The pharma- cist entrepreneur deﬁnition proposed as a result of thisstudy (Figure 3) captures four of those ﬁve domains, onlyomitting competitive aggressiveness. Competitive ag- gressiveness refers to an entrepreneur directly challeng- ing others in a marketplace to gain position or marketshare. 14While not included in our ﬁnal deﬁnition, prin- ciples of strategy related to market analysis and compe-tition were identiﬁed by our panel as essential knowledge and skills needed for a pharmacist entrepreneur. The 2010-2011 AACP Academic Affairs Standing Committee described the entrepreneurship trait as one that revolves around taking on the risks and responsibilities as-sociated with implementing innovations. 15Additionally, the committee considered critical thinking and problem- solving foundational components and cited Rubino and Freshman’s eight entrepreneurship competency clusters(decision making, strategic thinking, risk-taking, conﬁdencebuilding, communicating ideas, motivating team members, tolerance of ambiguity and internal locus of control) as potential areas for development for pharmacist entrepre-neurs. 15,16The CAPE’s 2013 Educational Outcomesreinforced Rubino and Freshman’s competency clusters and further speciﬁed entrepreneurship recommendations to “engage in innovative activities by using creative thinking to envision better ways of accomplishing professional goals.”3 This study’s proposed deﬁnition of a pharmacist entrepre-neur encompasses the CAPE recommendation and expands the construct to give pharmacy educators more guidance. Approaches Effective for Entrepreneurship Education Our expert panel ranked a mix ed instructional approach (didactic and experiential) as th e most important process for educating pharmacist entrepren eurs. While didactic lectures were recognized for some of the foundational knowledge items, the panel ranked active-learning --- subsection of the 2013 Educational Outcomes.3Our panel found several char- acteristics typically identiﬁed with multiple leadership frameworks important for entrepreneurs. Items such as adaptability, self-assessment, dealing with failure, and communication are all consistent with different models of leadership.20,21Other items identiﬁed such as health system literacy and pharmacy core sciences demonstratehow being competent in pharmacy is necessary (by deﬁ- nition) to be a successful pharmacist entrepreneur.In terms of attitudes, the concept of failure may be closely tied to several highly ranked characteristics for a pharmacist entrepreneur. Resiliency, determination, positivity, and risk-taking were the four most important attitudes identified in this study, which may all be linked to different stages of (before, during, and after) failure. During the semi-structured interviews and round 1 open response analysis, several experts recognized the ability to bounce back from failure as a critical attitude for any future entrepreneur. Our experts recognized failure as part of the process and being resilient to failure as a necessity. If the potential for failure is viewed through an optimisticlens, then one may be more predisposed to greater risk- taking. Gaining experience through failure (or multiple failures) may be valuable for the pharmacist entrepreneur, however, the pharmacy education apparatus does not support this type of learning. An old adage, “C equals PharmD,” has been passed down to many students over the past two decades. This embodies the notion that anything but failure within the formal curriculum of a school of pharmacy will be rewarded with the doctoralhood. Failure within a single pharmacy class may lead to the probation or expulsion of a student as they have not demonstrated the mastery of the course objectives deemed necessary to eventually become a pharmacist. One could argue that the environment created to educate pharmacists to meet the

Additionally, the panel found value in proactively targeting stu dents with greater interests in entrepreneurship with more ad vanced elective opportunities. Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes This study adds a comprehensive list of KSAs ranked in order of importance for pharmacy educators to consider during the instructional design process (Table 4).

ability to communicate effectively (oral, written, and in- terpersonal) was ranked the most important item identi- ﬁed both as knowledge and a skill. This supports the use of written and oral presentations throughout the curriculum and may demonstrate how many other pharmacy courses indirectly beneﬁt the future pharmacist entrepreneur. De- veloping a business plan was also ranked highly as founda- tional knowledge and a skill. Schools may consider engaging with the National Community Pharmacists Association for guidance related to business plan development given the organization’s history of running a national business plan competition speciﬁcally for student members.17 Several foundational knowledge areas overlap with the knowledge students should be gaining in existing pharmacy management courses. These areas relate to items often taught in masters programs in business management such as strat- egy, project management, finance, accounting, marketing, and human resource management. Dual PharmD/Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs capture these topic areas in more depth, but our panel did not explicitly recommend that the pharmacist entrepreneur have an MBAor equivalent education. Previous research related to dual PharmD/MBA degree-earning students found that the ma- jority of graduates entered the pharmaceutical industry, chain pharmacy, hospital/institutional, or managed care pharmacy. 18Business management programs may be helpful to gain the foundational knowledge and skills fre- quently identiﬁed with entrepreneurs, but evidence from a sample of these dual degree stu dents suggests the motivation stems from a desire to be more competitive in an existing job market rather than to create new business opportunities.19 Leadership was also identified as foundational knowledge as well as a skill necessary for entrepreneurs, which CAPE identified in its own subsection of the 2013 Educational Outcomes.3Our panel found several char- acteristics typically
a pharmacist. One could argue that the environment created to educate pharmacists to meet the competency standards to practice pharmacy directly inhibits the growth of an environment that en- courages a “try-fail-and-try-again” approach. We are not advocating or encouraging student failures in core phar- macy classes, but simply calling for more opportunities embedded throughout the curriculum where students mayexperiment with new ideas without the fear that failure could end (or stall) their pharmacy career. Entrepreneurship Education for Pharmacists Ap- plied to Bloom’s Taxonomy For schools and colleges of pharmacy considering curricular development or integration of entrepreneurship education, we propose a framework combining the cog- nitive processes identified in Bloom’s taxonomy withspeciﬁc application to entrepreneurship (Figure 2). As faculty develop instructional plans, we recommend usingTable 4.

didactic lectures to cover foundational knowledge com- ponents (remember function of Bloom’s taxonomy) and to explain the role of pharmacy within the broader context of healthcare so that students may begin to identify areas of unmet need (understand function). Within these di- dactic classes, we recommend incorporating structured exercises that allow students to use the newly acquired knowledge in new settings, forcing them to propose aninnovative solution to a problem (apply function). Team- based activities may be preferred for these structured activities based on the feedback from our Delphi study. Examinations may be helpful to assess how well students are able to differentiate between strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for a given business proposal (analyze function) and to critique the value proposition ofthe business idea (evaluate function). While on rotation or through other experiential opportunities (summer in- ternship or fellowship), students should be tasked with activities that cover the apply, analyze, and evaluate functions. Depending on the length of the experience, the students may have the opportunity to help preceptors design, develop, and implement a new business idea that adds value to patient care, practice, or the pharmacyprofession (create function). It may be difﬁcult for most students to reach the create function while in pharmacy school, because implementation of the business plan may be time consuming for a full-time student. Engaging in business plan competitions or other proposal develop- ment activities may help capture the rest of the create domain; however, students must recognize that more Figure 2.

learning will be achieved through doing or executing the plan. Place in the Strategic Plan and Curriculum Given our higher threshold for panel agreement, none of the statements developed from our Delphi relatedto the importance of entrepreneurship inclusion in a school’s mission or curriculum reached $75%. While multiple items did meet a $50% threshold, these state- ments clearly did not resonate with everyone on the panel. During the six in-depth interviews with experienced en- trepreneurs, the consensus was that entrepreneurship was vital to a school’s mission and vision as the interviewees felt that entrepreneurship would be necessary for the profession to survive and advance. While this sentimentwas shared by several Delphi panel members, there was still hesitancy to make a ﬁrm statement that entrepre- neurship should be an integral part of a school’s strategic plan. We recommend that deans, faculty members, stu- dents, and other key institutional stakeholders consider how the entrepreneurship construct may ﬁt within their current educational environment before making it a for- mal component of the school’s mission and vision. Con- sidering the ACPE Standards, schools must address entrepreneurship within the curriculum to meet Standard 4, but our study reveals that several experts are not onboard with the notion that entrepreneurship must be in the curriculum for a PharmD program. 1,3We recommend further discussion at the AACP-level to hear dissenting opinions or concerns with curricular inclusion. In a Delphi process, the selection of appropriate ex- perts may be the most challenging step that researchers must consider in terms of bias.22We focused on suc- cessful entrepreneurs for the semi-structured in-depth interviews to build the ﬁrst round of the Delphi, but thenwe purposefully recruited a large proportion of panelists with direct ties to academia as an instructor or adminis- trator (62%) who had demonstrated interest in entrepre- neurship education. While
or adminis- trator (62%) who had demonstrated interest in entrepre- neurship education. While we felt this was appropriate to gain the opinions of pharmacy educators, results may have been different if we had focused solely on recruiting a panel of experienced entrepreneurs. Another limitation of our Delphi process involves the more stringent deﬁ- nition of panel agreement at $75%. This deﬁnition was chosen to be more selective and to include only the items where a supermajority agreed, but it is important forreaders to consider those items in Tables 2 and 3 that were mentioned by multiple panelists but failed to meet the a priori threshold. For example, attitudes representing empathy, humility, altruism, and cultural sensitivity were mentioned during the in-depth interviews as well as the ﬁrst Delphi round, but were not included in the ﬁnal set. Ifwe had focused our Delphi recruitment solely on social entrepreneurs, we believe that these attitudes would have been more widely accepted. We have presented all items for the sake of transparency as well as to encourage other researchers to explore whether constructs with less agreement in our panel should be examined further. CONCLUSION Through semi-structured interviews with experi- enced entrepreneurs and a multi-round Delphi process, a framework for entrepreneurship education applied to pharmacy was proposed along with an extensive list of KSAs expected for successful pharmacist entrepreneurs. The panel also produced a consensus definition of a “pharmacist entrepreneur” to help guide both accreditors and schools as they work to address the requirementsfor formal evaluation and quality improvement of instructional design. Additional research to inform implementation and assessment of entrepreneurship within pharmacy curricula would provide more spe- ciﬁc guidance for instructional design and accreditation evaluations.
