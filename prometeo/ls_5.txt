Feature article 18 | Research-Technology Management • September—October 2021 The Hybrid Model Matrix Enhancing Stage-Gate with Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile Managers can use the Hybrid Model Matrix to decide when to use design thinking, Lean Startup, or Agile with Stage-Gate to boost  new product development. Nicolò cocchi, clio Dosi, and Matteo Vignoli OVERVIEW:  The Hybrid Model Matrix supports managers’ decision-making regarding which new product development  (NPD) processes to activate for a specific project. Stage-Gate is the backbone process of the matrix, and design thinking, Lean  Startup, and Agile are plugged in to create three different hybrid models. The matrix also provides guidance regarding when  R&D managers might use each model. The Hybrid Model Matrix outlines four approaches––linear Stage-Gate and the three  hybrid models—that R&D managers may activate selectively based on company knowledge of users and categories. R&D  managers can use the Hybrid Model Matrix to guide NPD projects better since they can determine the most suitable model  given each opportunity’s specific context. KEYWORDS:  New product development, Hybrid model, Stage-Gate, Agile, Design thinking, Lean Startup Given the complexity of new product development (NPD)  within manufacturing firms, linear NPD processes such  as the traditional Stage-Gate cannot handle the iterative  cycles and external collaboration that characterize today’s  product development efforts (Sommer et al. 2015). To be  innovative, organizations need to embrace flexibility and  agility to respond effectively to the external environment  (Magistretti et al. 2019). Research shows that some man - ufacturing organizations have successfully implemented  the Agile–Stage-Gate hybrid model (Sommer et al. 2015):  they have embedded Agile methodologies within the  Stage-Gate process, supported customers’ involvement in  the process, and improved responsiveness to changing  customer needs (Cooper 2016).

in  the process, and improved responsiveness to changing  customer needs (Cooper 2016). A new set of hybrid models has emerged that involves design thinking and  Stage-Gate (Franchini, Dosi, and Vignoli 2017), and Lean  Startup and Stage-Gate (DelVecchio, White, and Phelan  2013). Our research considers the Stage-Gate process as the lead - ing NPD model with its hybridization with Agile develop- ment, design thinking, and Lean Startup. Companies struggle  to use such hybrid models due to inherent tensions between  the iterative methodologies and the traditional gating system  (Cooper and Sommer 2018), and because the underlying  philosophy of these methodologies often conflict with the  existing organizational culture (Mahmoud-Jouini, Fixson,  and Boulet 2019).

The Hybrid Model Matrix September—October 2021 | 19share our Hybrid Model Matrix to help R&D managers in  implementing hybrid models. theory and research Question Introduced in the 1980s, Stage-Gate remains the most widely  adopted NPD process. Major corporations still use it (Cooper  2016). Companies have tried to adapt Stage-Gate based on  a project’s complexity and risk (Cooper 2014) and its type  and size (Vedsmand, Kielgast, and Cooper 2016). In 2000, Agile entered the manufacturing world from the  software industry. It made the Stage-Gate process more flex - ible, increased the success rate of innovation projects (Misra,  Kumar, and Kumar 2009), and improved cost control, prod - uct functionality, and on-time delivery (Karlstrom and  Runeson 2005). The Agile–Stage-Gate hybrid model incor - porates Agile scrum cycles during the development and test - ing stages within the Stage-Gate process (Cooper and  Sommer 2016; Magistretti et al. 2019). Other hybrid models emerging in companies’ NPD pro- cesses include design thinking (Brown 2008) and Lean  Startup (Ries 2011) practices. For instance, Procter & Gamble  uses design thinking to support development teams in idea  development, team achievement, and learning (Carlgren,  Rauth, and Elmquist 2016), while General Electric has devel- oped FastWorks, a framework based on Lean Startup prin- ciples such as rapid deliverables and continuous learning, to  accelerate the NPD process (Power 2014). Senior managers are often reluctant to abandon traditional  Stage-Gate processes. They have concerns about introducing  hybrid models due to inherent tensions between the Stage- Gate process and Agile (Cooper 2016), design thinking (Hölzle  and Rhinow 2019 ), and Lean Startup (DelVecchio, White, and  Phelan 2013) methodologies. It can also be difficult to chal- lenge consolidated organizational practices and transform a  company’s organizational culture from a Stage-Gate structured  paradigm to a more creative and dynamic
organizational culture from a Stage-Gate structured  paradigm to a more creative and dynamic innovation engine  (Meyer and Marion 2010). The literature recommends using  the established Agile–Stage-Gate hybrid model “in more  ambiguous and uncertain initiatives . . . to help reserve Agile  for projects that truly need it” (Cooper and Sommer 2018,   p. 25) as that hybrid model requires dedicated resources.  Researchers do not agree about which stages and for which  projects Agile will work (Cooper and Sommer 2018). In addi- tion, scant literature exists regarding hybrid models that rely  on design thinking and Lean Startup methodologies. Design thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile development are  assimilated methodologies at the organizational level that  support NPD processes as stand-alone methodologies or in  hybrid models. Given their widespread diffusion, we aimed  to understand the main variables that signal when to use  hybrid models and to investigate in which phases of Stage- Gate companies should embed a specific methodology  (design thinking, Lean Startup, and/or Agile). Methodology We opted to conduct a single case study (Eisenhardt 1989)  of a representative company (Siggelkow 2007) that used Stage-Gate as its standard NPD process, and design thinking,  Lean Startup, and Agile methodologies to support NPD. The  selected company, which remains anonymous because some  of the NPD projects we present are ongoing, is a global leader  in the food and beverage industry. To guarantee proximity  to the field and to understand practices as they happen, one  coauthor was involved in a one-year study of the company’s  R&D. We performed 28 interviews with managers from R&D,  Marketing, HR, and Finance (average time length 56 min),  three meetings with the Design Thinking Head (average time  length 91 min), and a three-hour workshop with 12 partic- ipants from the R&D, Marketing, and Strategy departments  (Figure 1). We recorded, transcribed, and analyzed data, and  we
and Strategy departments  (Figure 1). We recorded, transcribed, and analyzed data, and  we triangulated interviewees’ answers with official company  documents (Jick 1979). We conducted our research in four  phases. Phase 1—NPD Approaches In Phase 1, we aimed to understand how the company imple - mented the different NPD approaches. Stage-Gate is the com - pany’s main NPD process, but for the last five years it has  used design thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile methodologies  to support NPD. The company has developed internal orga- nizational structures and processes to apply the three meth- odologies, but managers have no formal guidelines regarding  when to activate them. Phase 2—NPD Projects and NPD Processes Used The Phase 2 interviews went deeper at the project level. We  asked interviewees to recall the most interesting NPD project  in which they were involved, describe the project and process  used, and explain what worked and what did not. We iden- tified 20 projects, and for each we traced the NPD process  and whether the company hybridized the Stage-Gate process.  We identified three different hybrid models. Phase 3—Revision of NPD Processes Used The fact that managers selected a specific NPD process for those  20 projects does not mean that it was the best choice. The com - pany has no formal guidelines to determine which NPD process  to use nor does it have any shared knowledge about when to  use the three identified hybrid models. During the Phase 3 inter - views, we selected six senior R&D and marketing managers,  and we asked them to reflect on whether they would have  selected the same NPD process for each of the 20 projects. In  the cases where the interviewees indicated they would have  selected a different NPD process, we asked them what process  they would have chosen among the four identified NPD pro- cesses and why (Figure 2). When explaining why a process was appropriate or not,  interviewees mentioned internal NPD process elements.  Process
a process was appropriate or not,  interviewees mentioned internal NPD process elements.  Process speed is one of the most cited as are process fluidity,  solidity of the process, and process feeling. When interview- ees referred to those elements, they used expressions such  as “We were stuck” and “We had to start all over again”  (process fluidity); “We had enough data” and “We needed  more information to design” (process solidity); and “We felt
20 | Research-Technology Management The Hybrid Model Matrixsafe” and “The project had lights and shadows” (process feel - ing). Interviewees did not refer to the success of a product  on the market as an element to understand whether the  process was good enough, as too many variables beyond the  NPD process can affect its outcome. Phase 4––Identification of Variables We performed qualitative data analysis by coding key pas- sages in which the interviewees recalled an NPD process  decision. We used the qualitative software MAXQDA for our  qualitative data analysis. Following the coding technique  described by Gioia, Corley, and Hamilton (2013), we identi- fied recurrent categories emerging from interviewees’ words  such as “new category,” “existing category,” “consumer  driven,” and “consumer need.” We then aggregated them  into second-order themes such as “knowledge about product  category” and “knowledge about users” and obtained a set  of more abstract categories that identify our decision vari- ables (Figure 3).results We present our results according to the four phases in our  methodology. Phase 1—Coexistence of Four Approaches Without  Guidelines to Choose Among Them We found that managers can activate design thinking, Lean  Startup, and Agile development when needed, depending  on available organizational resources—such as support from  business units, budget to back NPD projects, and specialists’  availability—even if no activation guidelines are present in  the official documentation. No company structure supports  management decision-making in understanding when, for  a given project, it makes sense to activate one methodology  over another. Managers have developed a practical under - standing of the advantages and values of each NPD  process. Stage-Gate––The company has been using the typical  5-Stage 5-Gate process (ideation, concept, business case,  FIGURE 1. Methodology
The Hybrid Model Matrix September—October 2021 | 21development, testing, launch, and post-launch review  phases) since the 1990s to support its product launches.  Shorter Stage-Gate versions (3-Stage 3-Gate and 2-Stage  2-Gate processes) can be activated in cases of incremental  improvements or small investments. To classify NPD projects  and decide which Stage-Gate versions to adopt, the company  uses a framework based on two variables: knowledge about  the product category and the project’s estimated capital  expenditures (CapEx). The company assigns a formal leader  and team to each Stage-Gate project, and it provides senior  management gatekeepers who assess the project’s  progress. Design thinking––The company created a Design Thinking  Area within its R&D department early in 2015 to support  FIGURE 2.

22 | Research-Technology Management The Hybrid Model Matrixprojects using design thinking. The company has two full- time design thinking experts. Through internal structured  processes, any project leader from any department can ask  for methodological support. In the design thinking projects,  the appointed team aims to learn about user needs and hab- its, discover the solution design principles, and develop func - tional elements of the product. The most common tools used  are contextual interviews, observations, online surveys, per - sonas, customer journey maps, “how might we” questions,  mind maps, brainstorming, storyboards, and rough  prototypes.Lean Startup––The Open  Innovation department is the com - pany reference point for the Lean  Startup approach, and any project  leader can ask for methodological  support. When the company uses  Lean Startup to develop a project,  it selects a team that can be either  internal or external. The goal is fast  delivery of a product to market, to  test design and business assump- tions—for example, recipes, price,  supply chain relationships, and  shelf positioning. The team first  identifies a set of hypotheses and  then deploys the Build-Measure- Learn cycle. Agile development––The company  uses Agile to speed up the NPD pro - cess, build in the voice of the cus- tomer, and empower the team in  making decisions. When the com- pany develops a project phase  using Agile, it creates a cross-func- tional team of 11 people dedicated  full-time to the project to develop  and iteratively test product, price,  packaging, and other attributes  with customers. Typical Agile ele- ments used during the projects  include the product and sprint  backlog, to the scrum board and  the daily stand-up meeting. Phase 2—Three Hybrid Models Out of the 20 projects, we found that the company used  Stage-Gate for 13 and 3 specific hybrid models for the  remaining 7. Design thinking/Stage-Gate––During the ideation phase, the  company uses the
for the  remaining 7. Design thinking/Stage-Gate––During the ideation phase, the  company uses the design thinking methodology to support  the Stage-Gate process. The NPD process starts with a product  vision. For example, Project G started with the vision “We  need a biscuit with dried fruit” (see “Project G: Biscuits with  FIGURE 3. Data structure Project G: Biscuits with Dried Fruit Project G entailed exploring the dried fruit market trend to  exploit it within the company’s own biscuit category. Biscuits  are one of the company’s most profitable categories, but dried  fruit users were completely new. The challenge was wide, and  the team decided to ask the Design Thinking Area for method- ological support to explore how users could react to the many  ways in which the dried fruit could be mixed with a biscuit. The  Design Thinking Area involved an external research organiza- tion for the ideation phase. The design thinking methodology  support lasted eight weeks. The external research organization updated the company’s internal team weekly, and the internal  team participated in the design of the rough prototypes that the  external team tested. The results confirmed the dried fruit trend.  The company approved a final product idea of a crisp biscuit  with two different dried fruits with specific elements regarding  the shape, the ingredients, and the packaging’s sustainability.  The product idea, along with insights from users regarding the  moment of consumption (snack), refined the initial product vision,  which was a generic biscuit with dried fruit. The company then  used Stage-Gate to manage the project.
The Hybrid Model Matrix September—October 2021 | 23Dried Fruit” on page 22). The design thinking methodology  develops the product vision by generating different coherent  ideas, making them tangible through rough prototypes, and  gathering user feedback. Users’ interactions with prototypes  provide priceless reactions that the company analyzes to  design around them. The Project G design thinking team  tested rough prototypes of different shapes and different  ingredients and understood which ones best fit users’ needs.  Once the team validated the ideas, it managed the other  phases of the NPD process (concept, business case, develop- ment, testing, and launch) through Stage-Gate. Depending  on each project’s specifics, the Design Thinking Area decides  whether to support the internal team with external resources.  When using internal resources, the Design Thinking Area  creates a team of expert employees from different depart- ments and involves the Design Thinking coach to facilitate  the process. For external resources, the Design Thinking Area  partners with design studios, universities, or other research  organizations that report the research progress weekly to the  appointed company team. In all cases, the process lasts from  4 to 14 weeks. Design thinking and Lean Startup/Stage-Gate––This hybrid  model supports the ideation and concept phases with design  thinking and the business case phase with Lean Startup. The  company uses this model when no product vision is evident  at the outset. For example, Project I started with a broader  challenge: “How might we embed the legumes trend within  our products to respond to the increasing healthiness  request?” (see “Project I: Legumes Main Course Dish” on  page 23). The design thinking methodology reframes the  problem in the ideation phase mainly by conducting user  interviews and gathering observations. For example, Project  I’s team realized that users wanted to feel a raw sensation,  have a poly-sensorial
Project  I’s team realized that users wanted to feel a raw sensation,  have a poly-sensorial experience, and express their creativity  while cooking a dish with legumes. Accordingly, the team designed a product idea of “legumes seeds.” In the concept  phase, the design thinking methodology defines the product  concept’s general attributes (packaging, brand choice, or gen - eral recipe) by iteratively developing and testing rough pro- totypes and by defining the design principles—namely, the  attributes that the product needs. Project I design principles  included the shape of the pieces (diamond-like shape), the  number of legumes (a mix of three different legumes), and  the recipe (100 percent legumes flour). At the end of the  concept phase, the design thinking methodology offers a  physical product concept, which the company turns into a  minimum viable product (MVP) to kick off the business case  phase with the Lean Startup methodology. In this phase, the  team launches the MVP on the market to experiment with  unclear business decisions (such as shelf positioning, brand  positioning, or packaging). Once the company validates the  business case, the project follows development, testing, and  launch phases with the Stage-Gate process. The design think - ing phases last between three and nine months, depending  on the depth of the challenge. Once an MVP is developed,  the company can either involve a retailer or form a startup  to run the Lean Startup experiments on the market.Project i: legumes Main course Dish Project I aimed to answer the question: “How might we embed the  legumes trend within our products to respond to the increasing  healthiness request?” Given the company’s limited knowledge of  the users—that is, the legumes lovers or carb-fear users—and the  lack of clarity about the product category, the Design Thinking  Area involved a partner university in the project. The project excluded a pasta solution as healthy users were not  considering carbs a
the project. The project excluded a pasta solution as healthy users were not  considering carbs a viable option. During the ideation phase, the  design thinking team realized that users wanted to feel a raw sen- sation, by recognizing the authenticity of the ingredients they use  to cook; to have a poly-sensorial experience, by feeling different  texture to perceive the meal as extremely tasty; and to express  their creativity while cooking a dish with legumes. The ideation  phase concluded with a product idea of “legumes seeds” having  different types of pressed legumes flour. During the concept phase, the design thinking team gathered  useful information from the users’ interaction about the shape of  pieces (diamond-like shape), the number of legumes (mix of three different legumes), the number of ingredients per piece (each  grain made of a single legume), and the composition (100 percent  legumes flour). The team tested several prototypes until it chose  the final concept that represented a range of main course or side  dishes that were made of 100 percent legumes flour processed  into diamond-shaped grains. The project entered the business case stage with several open  questions such as which shelf (rice, legumes and cereals, other  shelves), what format (single portion, three people portions, fam- ily pack, other formats), and which brand. The company tested  the first version of the product at a big retailer. After a year of  iterations and tests conducted using Lean Startup principles, the  company structured the market launch of the product and the  project went through the final phases of the Stage-Gate process  (development, testing, and launch). The product is now part of  the company’s offerings in European markets, and the company  is evaluating a US-market launch. Project I is a successful example  of a hybrid model. When asked, our interviewees could not  explain what variables drive  management to decide which  methodology to embed in the Stage-

24 | Research-Technology Management The Hybrid Model MatrixAgile–Stage-Gate––Agile development scaffolds the Stage- Gate process in the development and testing phases to  acquire knowledge about some category dynamics. The com - pany uses Stage-Gate to manage previous and successful  phases. For example, Project N had to improve the product  visibility within the market shelf and test different prices (see  “Project N: Granola Bar” on page 24). To do this, the Agile  team iteratively delivered different versions of the product  in six different stores for a period of six months. The team  gathered insights directly from the field through qualitative  (interviews) and quantitative (shelf-rotation measures)  methods and iteratively refined the product variables under  investigation. The Agile team comprises 11 full-time internal  experts who have the authority to make decisions based on  the field analysis. The Agile team presented all results gath- ered in the development and testing gates. Phase 3—NPD Processes Used versus Suggested by  Interviewees For 12 projects out of 20, we found agreement among inter - viewees regarding the NPD processes used and the NPD pro - cesses the respondents suggested. For example, when talking  about Project I, interviewee 13 reported, “The case of the  Legumes Main Course Dish proves that the integration  between emergent methodologies, like design thinking and  Lean Startup, and our classical innovation process makes  sense. . . . The use of design thinking and Lean Startup in  the first phases of the project allowed us to speed up the  development process.” For the remaining eight projects, interviewees suggested  a different process. For instance, when talking about Project  P, interviewee 1 stated, “After the launch, we realized that  the product concept did not work . . . and we found ourselves trying to redesign the solution. . . . It happened because we  have not explored enough. In those cases, the involvement  of the Design
. It happened because we  have not explored enough. In those cases, the involvement  of the Design Thinking Area since the beginning would have  helped because it would have clarified what the drivers are,  what the design principles are, and what the right user expe - rience is.” Phase 4—Decision Variables The company’s official documentation does not specify any  procedure that identifies the most appropriate hybrid model  to use at the beginning of a new project. Stage-Gate is the  only standard process, and managers can modify it by intro- ducing one of the other three methodologies. However, the  choices managers make are not necessarily based on shared  best practices, and they depend on the specific manager or  situation. When asked, our interviewees could not explain  what variables drive management to decide which method- ology to embed in the Stage-Gate process. Interviewees often  provided detailed explanations about why they chose (or  would have chosen) a specific methodology for a project. Knowledge about product category and about users  emerged as crucial discriminant variables to identify the  proper NPD methodologies that hybridize the Stage-Gate  process. For example, regarding knowledge about users,  interviewee 4 reported, “We worked together with the  Design Thinking Area on the legumes snack project  [Project J]. . . . I believe that such deep analyses are  needed when the project involves a new consumer— namely, people interested in a world that the company  does not know yet, because in these cases the Stage-Gate  analyses only are not enough.” According to the interviewees and the company’s official  documentation, financial consideration is an element that  defines project risk assessment and portfolio decisions, and  it is not viewed as a variable that should drive the selection  of the NPD methodology. Interviewee 13 said, “If a project  exceeds a certain amount of CapEx, it is now managed as a  key project, no matter the fact that it
exceeds a certain amount of CapEx, it is now managed as a  key project, no matter the fact that it is just the improvement  of an existing product . . . but the driver to identify innova- tion paths should not be the CapEx of the project.” Our interviewees also indicated that technological knowl - edge should not be a relevant variable in the NPD method- ology selection because every project has to face this issue  during the technical feasibility assessment, and it impacts the  depth and length of the NPD process. Interviewee 13 said,  “Every time we develop a project, we need to face some Knowledge about product category and  about users emerged as crucial  discriminant variables to identify the  proper NPD methodologies that  hybridize the Stage-Gate process.Project N: Granola Bar Project N’s purpose was to develop a variant of an existing granola  bar. During the development and testing NPD phases, Agile devel - opment supported the Stage-Gate process. In the project’s devel - opment phase, the company conducted a feasibility and viability  check. The company needed to understand how to improve the  product visibility within the market shelf, given that the packaging  of the basic version of the product did not reflect its “premium” qualities. It also needed to evaluate whether or not the product  supported a higher price than its basic version. The Agile team  designed several experiments around packaging and price options  and tested them within different stores. The company discussed  the gathered results during the gates. Project N went through  the launch phase of the Stage-Gate process. The product is now  successfully placed within the Italian market.
The Hybrid Model Matrix September—October 2021 | 25 FIGURE 4. NPD projects’ distribution around the identified variablesquestions. Does the technology  exist? Does the company own  the technology? These ques- tions address the feasibility  assessment, which in turn  allows understanding of how  many NPD phases the project  needs to go through.” the Hybrid Model Matrix From our study we determined  two relevant variables that  should inform the selection of  the most suitable NPD method - ology: knowledge about users  and knowledge about product  category. We defined a 2x2  matrix and classified the 20 col - lected projects within the four  quadrants (Figure 4). By placing the 20 projects  within the matrix and observ- ing what NPD process the inter - viewees suggested for each  project, we realized that each  quadrant presented a specific  NPD model (Figure 5). When the knowledge about  users and the category is wide,  Stage-Gate perfectly fits as an  NPD process since all the infor - mation and competence are  inside the company already,  and the company focuses on  minimizing risks. Interviewee  10 expressed this while com- menting on the dark chocolate  project (Project A): “The biscuit  [in its classical form] is one of  the main products of the morn - ing goods category . . . it is  important to have its version  for dark chocolate lovers. . . .  That product must be the best  ever, so every detail needs to be  taken care of. This is just an  improvement project; I do not  think it costs anything.  However, in my opinion, the  obsession has to be maximum  . . . and you use the Stage-Gate  for such a project. You do not  need to explore; you do not  need to experiment.” During Phase 4, we discov- ered that when the company  faces a knowledge gap in terms   FIGURE 5. The Hybrid Model Matrix
26 | Research-Technology Management The Hybrid Model Matrixof category or users, other methodologies need to support  the Stage-Gate process. Low Knowledge about Users/High Category Knowledge––In this  case, the design thinking/Stage-Gate hybrid model enables  the company to learn about users. For instance, Interviewee  6 linked this suggestion to the necessity of confirming the  habits of users to define or validate a product idea before  performing other activities in the Stage-Gate. He said, “There  are cases in which you already have a product, but you want  to adapt it to a wider number of users [Project Q, R, and S].  In those cases, you need a deeper analysis of users than the  one that Stage-Gate can offer. You need to understand if the  market trend you are designing for is a will-o’-the-wisp or  will stand for longer, and if it is worth a new product. . . . A  good initial assessment on users with design thinking fits  such an exploration, rather than the Stage-Gate.” Low Knowledge about Users/Low Category Knowledge––In this  instance, our results suggest using the design thinking and  Lean Startup/Stage-Gate hybrid model. As interviewee 6  explained, “If we decide to enter a new product category  where the user knowledge is minimal, it is impossible to start  the project with the Stage-Gate approach. . . . Stage-Gate  requires data since the beginning, but in these cases, you  have to deal with the fact that you have to collect data while  you are working on the project because data is not available.”  Design thinking addresses the knowledge of the users’ gap  first by defining the product idea during the ideation phase,  and second by defining the “product principles” during the  concept phase. Interviewee 4 expressed this idea recalling  the legumes snack project (Project J): “The [design thinking]  team was able to define not just an idea: the team synthesized  all the gathered insights into a list of design principles and  turned them into the product
all the gathered insights into a list of design principles and  turned them into the product concept. The design thinking  methodology allowed the company to understand a new  consumer.” Similarly, Lean Startup adds information regard - ing the dynamics of the category that are still unknown to  the company, and in particular, the ones that inquire about  the product-market fit. As interviewee 3 stated, “The product  concept the design thinking team came up with [Project J]  did not match with any existing company’s brand, and then  we decided to launch a startup. . . . We were able to assess .  . . different product channels. An e-commerce was launched,  and the product was also tested within the university vending  machines.”High Knowledge about Users/Low Category Knowledge––In this  case, the Agile–Stage-Gate hybrid model seems to fit the com- pany’s lessons learned. This model enters when the company  determines the product-market fit settled, but the company still  needs to learn about “category rules.” For example, Agile iter - ations inquire about product and packaging specifics and how  those elements could impact the production lines or specific  business elements such as price or shelf rotation. Interviewee  1 said, “When the fruit shake project [Project T] entered the  Stage-Gate process, we knew many things about users . . . and  we had many data that fostered the Stage-Gate analysis . . . .  Unfortunately, we entered a new category, and we knew noth - ing about that category dynamics. Nevertheless, we had the  overconfidence to set the packs, the prices, and the shelves  because we were aware of users’ preferences.” Interviewee 1  also shared, “Only after the launch, we realized that the users  did not recognize our product because all the others were struc - tured differently, with a different range of prices, on a deter - mined shelf. I believe that the Agile development process would  have helped to understand the category dynamics.” Validation of
Agile development process would  have helped to understand the category dynamics.” Validation of the Hybrid Model Matrix To validate the Hybrid Model Matrix, we performed a work- shop with 12 participants from different functions. The  attendees were not aware of the Hybrid Model Matrix we  created since we presented the research findings to the com - pany after validation. The workshop goal was to test whether  participants used “knowledge about the category” and  “knowledge about users” as variables that identify the proper  methodology, and whether they would suggest NPD pro- cesses in line with the ones outlined in the Hybrid Model  Matrix. We asked attendees to list some “embryonic” projects  they knew management wanted to develop. We grouped  participants into two groups, and we asked them to choose  a proper NPD process. The groups had to discuss the choices  they made and reach a consensus when they disagreed. The  workshop confirmed our finding that knowledge about users  and knowledge about category are significant decision vari- ables that guide the selection of hybrid models. By placing  the “embryonic” projects around the validated matrix and  observing the selected NPD processes, we found a complete  overlap with the Hybrid Model Matrix. We summarize the  final decision taken by the two groups, reporting one project  per quadrant, out of the eight discussed (Figure 6). How to apply the Hybrid Model Matrix The Hybrid Model Matrix provides four benefits: it supports  decision-making; it helps with evaluating users and category  knowledge; it supports learning; and it facilitates contingent  applications of methodologies. Decision-Making Support––Different types of innovation  projects may require different innovation processes, and  managers need to improve their ability to assess how they  must modify or adapt their use of the Stage-Gate process  (MacCormack et al. 2012). With no decisional supporting  tool, managers might base their decision on their
et al. 2012). With no decisional supporting  tool, managers might base their decision on their personal  methodological preferences or fears; on available the Hybrid Model Matrix supports  decision-making and learning, helps  with evaluating users and category  knowledge, and facilitates contingent  applications of methodologies.
The Hybrid Model Matrix September—October 2021 | 27organizational opportunities such as free slots or available  budget for project development from specific methodological  areas (for example, coaches from the Design Thinking Area);  or organizational culture and its eventual resistance towards  certain practices. Every project can be potentially developed  with any methodology. However, since hybrid models are  expensive, the Hybrid Model Matrix can help managers  decide when it is worthwhile to apply one or more of them. User Knowledge and Category Knowledge––User knowledge  and category knowledge are articulated in many elements.  User knowledge includes knowledge of users’ habits and  preferences. Category knowledge includes knowledge about  market dynamics, product price, and supply chain compe- tencies. In theory, any company understands its knowledge  of users and categories; therefore, R&D managers can identify  precisely the most suitable process for starting NPD projects.  However, when we tested the matrix, we found that man- agers could have divergent views regarding the classification of projects into high or low  users and category knowledge,  which sparked relevant discus- sions. When positioning a proj- ect in the matrix quadrants,  managers should engage peers  in their decision-making.  Reaching a shared agreement  on the NPD methodology before  starting the project can prevent  potential issues at later stages. User knowledge and cate- gory knowledge refer to the  company’s own knowledge.  Thus, the matrix has an internal  point of reference. Two different  companies developing the same  project might require different  NPD processes. The internal  definition of the matrix vari- ables offers an excellent advan- tage over other tools that  require considering external  variables such as technical risk  and market risk (MacCormack  et  al. 2012). In particular, the  use of internal information is  more beneficial than using  financial estimates or
particular, the  use of internal information is  more beneficial than using  financial estimates or techno- logical knowledge as decision  variables. In fact, before starting  the project, a company may  struggle to have enough infor - mation to rely on CapEx or  other financial elements for  projects that do not yet have a  solution. Suppose you want to  start an NPD project with  CapEx-reliable estimation. In  that case, you might delay  uncertain projects—for example, where user knowledge and  category knowledge are unknown for the company and  CapEx or other financial estimates are difficult to foresee—in  favor of incremental projects or projects closer to the com- pany domain (where user and category are known). This  bias could lead to an unbalanced innovation portfolio and  could be detrimental to any company not considering proj- ects that might open new business opportunities. Similarly, results do not suggest technological knowledge  among variables that should be considered to define the NPD  methodology selection. Our interviewees stated that tech- nology definition is a problem every project faces in the tech - nical feasibility assessment. Relevant technology should be  defined during the project, as doing so beforehand could  mislead the product definition. Further studies of the matrix  use in other manufacturing contexts could reveal more about  the technological knowledge variable. FIGURE 6. Validation of the Hybrid Model Matrix
28 | Research-Technology Management The Hybrid Model MatrixLearning in the Process––The Hybrid Model Matrix helps to  position a project in terms of learning needs—that is, knowl - edge gaps about users or categories—and provides recom- mendations regarding which process might best fulfill those  needs. Based on the matrix, Stage-Gate is useful for projects  that do not need to fulfill a significant learning in terms of  users or category knowledge. Bagno, Salerno, and Oliveira  da Silva (2017) also suggest Stage-Gate for incremental  innovation and not for extreme or radical innovation. For  innovations that require a significant learning effort, the  matrix proposes ways to embed other methodologies within  Stage-Gate. Design thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile have common  pillars, including using prototypes to learn in multidisci- plinary teams (Dosi, Mattarelli, and Vignoli 2020), testing  them with users, and iterating to define the solution pro- gressively. Significant differences also exist among the three  methodologies, and some studies show that if used incor - rectly those methodologies can harm the learning process  (Annosi, Foss, and Martini 2020). Design thinking is useful when the goal is to learn about  users’ habits and needs (Brown 2009). The Hybrid Model  Matrix suggests that use of hybrids with design thinking are  best in situations of limited user knowledge. When the  knowledge of the product category is high, the NPD team  expects the NPD solution to be a variant of a known category,  and the goal of design thinking is to understand how and, if  possible, to embed new users’ needs in the original product  vision (Dell’Era et  al. [2020] refer to design thinking as  inside-out sprint execution). When the company also has  limited knowledge of the product category, it has no prior  definition of a possible solution; therefore the team needs to  implement design thinking in more phases to identify solu- tions. In this broader application, design
design thinking in more phases to identify solu- tions. In this broader application, design thinking reframes  the challenge, defines the product’s design principles, and  devises with a solution concept ready to be developed  (Dell’Era et al. [2020] refer to design thinking as outside-in  creative problem solving). Lean Startup is useful for learning about business models  to gain product-market fit (Ries 2011). For those companies  looking to design a product for a new category in which only  limited knowledge about users exists, the Hybrid Model  Matrix suggests using Lean Startup to define the business  model elements. In the Hybrid Model Matrix, Lean Startup  builds on the knowledge gained through the design thinking  that occurs in lieu of the classical Lean Startup phase of prod - uct-solution fit. For the projects highlighted in this study, the  company experimented with business model solutions by  partnering with a retailer or by creating a startup. Agile is useful when focusing on technical details of a  product’s feasibility (production choices) and viability (mar - ket positioning) to define those elements with structured  experiments and users’ iterations. Those iterations are dif- ferent from those that define the business case with Lean  Startup or product solution with design thinking. The com- pany implements Agile when the final solution elements are clear, and it needs to fine-tune the given solutions. As inter - viewee 2 stated during the validation workshop, Agile gets  suggested when it is “not a matter of asking the market if the  product stands . . . [but rather when] you need to test the  market share.” Contingent Applications of Methodologies––The matrix clar - ifies when to activate a specific methodology, but each  methodology can be applied to the company’s context. In  terms of sector, a consumer packaged goods company could  apply Agile development with short iterations and estab- lished retailer agreements, while an automotive
Agile development with short iterations and estab- lished retailer agreements, while an automotive company  might apply the same method with long iterations and lead  users’ involvement. In terms of proficiency, a company with  limited proficiency in design thinking could execute its  sprint version (only for the ideation phase) with internal  resources but leverage external consultancy for its extensive  application (that needs problem reframing and concept  definition). Knowing in advance when to employ different meth- odological proficiencies is a big advantage from a human  resources perspective. Large companies can create specific  departments for each methodology within their R&D  operations and then involve methodology specialists only  in the most appropriate phase of NPD projects. Small- and  medium-sized companies that cannot afford to retain staff  proficient in multiple innovation methods (De Waal and  Knott 2019) could activate ad hoc consultancy in specific  phases of the process when they implement a precise  methodology. conclusion Companies that rely solely on Stage-Gate often struggle to  enact new methodologies. Design thinking, Lean Startup,  and Agile require significant investments—in terms of  employee training, dedicated resources, and new organiza- tional structures—and represent an approach that may run  counter to the prevailing organizational culture. The Hybrid  Model Matrix helps companies assess which projects will or  will not benefit from those extra methodological competen- cies. Using the matrix, managers can implement the optimal  process, concentrate on the NPD project and supporting the  appointed teams, and accelerate innovation by focusing the  company resources on the proper process. Companies can  use the matrix to understand what knowledge gaps regarding  users and category the project has to fill before it kicks off.  By employing the Hybrid Model Matrix in their deci- sion-making, companies can reduce conflicts, align

Feature article 18 | Research-Technology Management • September—October 2021 The Hybrid Model Matrix Enhancing Stage-Gate with Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile Managers can use the Hybrid Model Matrix to decide when to use design thinking, Lean Startup, or Agile with Stage-Gate to boost  new product development. Nicolò cocchi, clio Dosi, and Matteo Vignoli OVERVIEW:  The Hybrid Model Matrix supports managers’ decision-making regarding which new product development  (NPD) processes to activate for a specific project. Stage-Gate is the backbone process of the matrix, and design thinking, Lean  Startup, and Agile are plugged in to create three different hybrid models. The matrix also provides guidance regarding when  R&D managers might use each model. The Hybrid Model Matrix outlines four approaches––linear Stage-Gate and the three  hybrid models—that R&D managers may activate selectively based on company knowledge of users and categories. R&D  managers can use the Hybrid Model Matrix to guide NPD projects better since they can determine the most suitable model  given each opportunity’s specific context. KEYWORDS:  New product development, Hybrid model, Stage-Gate, Agile, Design thinking, Lean Startup Given the complexity of new product development (NPD)  within manufacturing firms, linear NPD processes such  as the traditional Stage-Gate cannot handle the iterative  cycles and external collaboration that characterize today’s  product development efforts (Sommer et al. 2015). To be  innovative, organizations need to embrace flexibility and  agility to respond effectively to the external environment  (Magistretti et al. 2019). Research shows that some man - ufacturing organizations have successfully implemented  the Agile–Stage-Gate hybrid model (Sommer et al. 2015):  they have embedded Agile methodologies within the  Stage-Gate process, supported customers’ involvement in  the process, and improved responsiveness to changing  customer needs (Cooper 2016). A new
in  the process, and improved responsiveness to changing  customer needs (Cooper 2016). A new set of hybrid models has emerged that involves design thinking and  Stage-Gate (Franchini, Dosi, and Vignoli 2017), and Lean  Startup and Stage-Gate (DelVecchio, White, and Phelan  2013). Our research considers the Stage-Gate process as the lead - ing NPD model with its hybridization with Agile develop- ment, design thinking, and Lean Startup. Companies struggle  to use such hybrid models due to inherent tensions between  the iterative methodologies and the traditional gating system  (Cooper and Sommer 2018), and because the underlying  philosophy of these methodologies often conflict with the  existing organizational culture (Mahmoud-Jouini, Fixson,  and Boulet 2019). We conducted a case study with a global  manufacturer that currently uses hybrid models, and we  DOI: 10.1080/08956308.2021.1942645Nicolò cocchi is a management engineer and currently a PhD student and  academic tutor at the Department of Management, Alma Mater Studiorum– University of Bologna.

The literature recommends using  the established Agile–Stage-Gate hybrid model “in more  ambiguous and uncertain initiatives . . . to help reserve Agile  for projects that truly need it” (Cooper and Sommer 2018,   p. 25) as that hybrid model requires dedicated resources.  Researchers do not agree about which stages and for which  projects Agile will work (Cooper and Sommer 2018). In addi- tion, scant literature exists regarding hybrid models that rely  on design thinking and Lean Startup methodologies. Design thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile development are  assimilated methodologies at the organizational level that  support NPD processes as stand-alone methodologies or in  hybrid models. Given their widespread diffusion, we aimed  to understand the main variables that signal when to use  hybrid models and to investigate in which phases of Stage- Gate companies should embed a specific methodology  (design thinking, Lean Startup, and/or Agile). Methodology We opted to conduct a single case study (Eisenhardt 1989)  of a representative company (Siggelkow 2007) that used Stage-Gate as its standard NPD process, and design thinking,  Lean Startup, and Agile methodologies to support NPD. The  selected company, which remains anonymous because some  of the NPD projects we present are ongoing, is a global leader  in the food and beverage industry. To guarantee proximity  to the field and to understand practices as they happen, one  coauthor was involved in a one-year study of the company’s  R&D. We performed 28 interviews with managers from R&D,  Marketing, HR, and Finance (average time length 56 min),  three meetings with the Design Thinking Head (average time  length 91 min), and a three-hour workshop with 12 partic- ipants from the R&D, Marketing, and Strategy departments  (Figure 1).

The Hybrid Model Matrix September—October 2021 | 19share our Hybrid Model Matrix to help R&D managers in  implementing hybrid models. theory and research Question Introduced in the 1980s, Stage-Gate remains the most widely  adopted NPD process. Major corporations still use it (Cooper  2016). Companies have tried to adapt Stage-Gate based on  a project’s complexity and risk (Cooper 2014) and its type  and size (Vedsmand, Kielgast, and Cooper 2016). In 2000, Agile entered the manufacturing world from the  software industry. It made the Stage-Gate process more flex - ible, increased the success rate of innovation projects (Misra,  Kumar, and Kumar 2009), and improved cost control, prod - uct functionality, and on-time delivery (Karlstrom and  Runeson 2005). The Agile–Stage-Gate hybrid model incor - porates Agile scrum cycles during the development and test - ing stages within the Stage-Gate process (Cooper and  Sommer 2016; Magistretti et al. 2019). Other hybrid models emerging in companies’ NPD pro- cesses include design thinking (Brown 2008) and Lean  Startup (Ries 2011) practices. For instance, Procter & Gamble  uses design thinking to support development teams in idea  development, team achievement, and learning (Carlgren,  Rauth, and Elmquist 2016), while General Electric has devel- oped FastWorks, a framework based on Lean Startup prin- ciples such as rapid deliverables and continuous learning, to  accelerate the NPD process (Power 2014). Senior managers are often reluctant to abandon traditional  Stage-Gate processes. They have concerns about introducing  hybrid models due to inherent tensions between the Stage- Gate process and Agile (Cooper 2016), design thinking (Hölzle  and Rhinow 2019 ), and Lean Startup (DelVecchio, White, and  Phelan 2013) methodologies. It can also be difficult to chal- lenge consolidated organizational practices and transform a  company’s organizational culture from a Stage-Gate structured  paradigm to a more creative and dynamic
and Strategy departments  (Figure 1). We recorded, transcribed, and analyzed data, and  we triangulated interviewees’ answers with official company  documents (Jick 1979). We conducted our research in four  phases. Phase 1—NPD Approaches In Phase 1, we aimed to understand how the company imple - mented the different NPD approaches. Stage-Gate is the com - pany’s main NPD process, but for the last five years it has  used design thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile methodologies  to support NPD. The company has developed internal orga- nizational structures and processes to apply the three meth- odologies, but managers have no formal guidelines regarding  when to activate them. Phase 2—NPD Projects and NPD Processes Used The Phase 2 interviews went deeper at the project level. We  asked interviewees to recall the most interesting NPD project  in which they were involved, describe the project and process  used, and explain what worked and what did not. We iden- tified 20 projects, and for each we traced the NPD process  and whether the company hybridized the Stage-Gate process.  We identified three different hybrid models. Phase 3—Revision of NPD Processes Used The fact that managers selected a specific NPD process for those  20 projects does not mean that it was the best choice. The com - pany has no formal guidelines to determine which NPD process  to use nor does it have any shared knowledge about when to  use the three identified hybrid models. During the Phase 3 inter - views, we selected six senior R&D and marketing managers,  and we asked them to reflect on whether they would have  selected the same NPD process for each of the 20 projects. In  the cases where the interviewees indicated they would have  selected a different NPD process, we asked them what process  they would have chosen among the four identified NPD pro- cesses and why (Figure 2). When explaining why a process was appropriate or not,  interviewees mentioned internal NPD process elements.  Process --- a process was appropriate or not,  interviewees mentioned internal NPD process elements.  Process speed is one of the most cited as are process fluidity,  solidity of the process, and process feeling. When interview- ees referred to those elements, they used expressions such  as “We were stuck” and “We had to start all over again”  (process fluidity); “We had enough data” and “We needed  more information to design” (process solidity); and “We felt --- 20 | Research-Technology Management The Hybrid Model Matrixsafe” and “The project had lights and shadows” (process feel - ing). Interviewees did not refer to the success of a product  on the market as an element to understand whether the  process was good enough, as too many variables beyond the  NPD process can affect its outcome. Phase 4––Identification of Variables We performed qualitative data analysis by coding key pas- sages in which the interviewees recalled an NPD process  decision. We used the qualitative software MAXQDA for our  qualitative data analysis. Following the coding technique  described by Gioia, Corley, and Hamilton (2013), we identi- fied recurrent categories emerging from interviewees’ words  such as “new category,” “existing category,” “consumer  driven,” and “consumer need.” We then aggregated them  into second-order themes such as “knowledge about product  category” and “knowledge about users” and obtained a set  of more abstract categories that identify our decision vari- ables (Figure 3).results We present our results according to the four phases in our  methodology. Phase 1—Coexistence of Four Approaches Without  Guidelines to Choose Among Them We found that managers can activate design thinking, Lean  Startup, and Agile development when needed, depending  on available organizational resources—such as support from  business units, budget to back NPD projects, and specialists’  availability—even if no activation guidelines are present in  the official documentation. No company structure supports  management decision-making in understanding when, for  a given project, it makes sense to activate one methodology  over another. Managers have developed a practical under - standing of the advantages and values of each NPD  process. Stage-Gate––The company has been using the typical  5-Stage 5-Gate process (ideation, concept, business case,  FIGURE 1. Methodology
The Hybrid Model Matrix September—October 2021 | 21development, testing, launch, and post-launch review  phases) since the 1990s to support its product launches.  Shorter Stage-Gate versions (3-Stage 3-Gate and 2-Stage  2-Gate processes) can be activated in cases of incremental  improvements or small investments. To classify NPD projects  and decide which Stage-Gate versions to adopt, the company  uses a framework based on two variables: knowledge about  the product category and the project’s estimated capital  expenditures (CapEx). The company assigns a formal leader  and team to each Stage-Gate project, and it provides senior  management gatekeepers who assess the project’s  progress. Design thinking––The company created a Design Thinking  Area within its R&D department early in 2015 to support  FIGURE 2.

22 | Research-Technology Management The Hybrid Model Matrixprojects using design thinking. The company has two full- time design thinking experts. Through internal structured  processes, any project leader from any department can ask  for methodological support. In the design thinking projects,  the appointed team aims to learn about user needs and hab- its, discover the solution design principles, and develop func - tional elements of the product. The most common tools used  are contextual interviews, observations, online surveys, per - sonas, customer journey maps, “how might we” questions,  mind maps, brainstorming, storyboards, and rough  prototypes.Lean Startup––The Open  Innovation department is the com - pany reference point for the Lean  Startup approach, and any project  leader can ask for methodological  support. When the company uses  Lean Startup to develop a project,  it selects a team that can be either  internal or external. The goal is fast  delivery of a product to market, to  test design and business assump- tions—for example, recipes, price,  supply chain relationships, and  shelf positioning. The team first  identifies a set of hypotheses and  then deploys the Build-Measure- Learn cycle. Agile development––The company  uses Agile to speed up the NPD pro - cess, build in the voice of the cus- tomer, and empower the team in  making decisions. When the com- pany develops a project phase  using Agile, it creates a cross-func- tional team of 11 people dedicated  full-time to the project to develop  and iteratively test product, price,  packaging, and other attributes  with customers. Typical Agile ele- ments used during the projects  include the product and sprint  backlog, to the scrum board and  the daily stand-up meeting. Phase 2—Three Hybrid Models Out of the 20 projects, we found that the company used  Stage-Gate for 13 and 3 specific hybrid models for the  remaining 7. Design thinking/Stage-Gate––During the ideation phase, the  company uses the
for the  remaining 7. Design thinking/Stage-Gate––During the ideation phase, the  company uses the design thinking methodology to support  the Stage-Gate process. The NPD process starts with a product  vision. For example, Project G started with the vision “We  need a biscuit with dried fruit” (see “Project G: Biscuits with  FIGURE 3. Data structure Project G: Biscuits with Dried Fruit Project G entailed exploring the dried fruit market trend to  exploit it within the company’s own biscuit category. Biscuits  are one of the company’s most profitable categories, but dried  fruit users were completely new. The challenge was wide, and  the team decided to ask the Design Thinking Area for method- ological support to explore how users could react to the many  ways in which the dried fruit could be mixed with a biscuit. The  Design Thinking Area involved an external research organiza- tion for the ideation phase. The design thinking methodology  support lasted eight weeks. The external research organization updated the company’s internal team weekly, and the internal  team participated in the design of the rough prototypes that the  external team tested. The results confirmed the dried fruit trend.  The company approved a final product idea of a crisp biscuit  with two different dried fruits with specific elements regarding  the shape, the ingredients, and the packaging’s sustainability.  The product idea, along with insights from users regarding the  moment of consumption (snack), refined the initial product vision,  which was a generic biscuit with dried fruit. The company then  used Stage-Gate to manage the project.
The Hybrid Model Matrix September—October 2021 | 23Dried Fruit” on page 22). The design thinking methodology  develops the product vision by generating different coherent  ideas, making them tangible through rough prototypes, and  gathering user feedback. Users’ interactions with prototypes  provide priceless reactions that the company analyzes to  design around them. The Project G design thinking team  tested rough prototypes of different shapes and different  ingredients and understood which ones best fit users’ needs.  Once the team validated the ideas, it managed the other  phases of the NPD process (concept, business case, develop- ment, testing, and launch) through Stage-Gate. Depending  on each project’s specifics, the Design Thinking Area decides  whether to support the internal team with external resources.  When using internal resources, the Design Thinking Area  creates a team of expert employees from different depart- ments and involves the Design Thinking coach to facilitate  the process. For external resources, the Design Thinking Area  partners with design studios, universities, or other research  organizations that report the research progress weekly to the  appointed company team. In all cases, the process lasts from  4 to 14 weeks. Design thinking and Lean Startup/Stage-Gate––This hybrid  model supports the ideation and concept phases with design  thinking and the business case phase with Lean Startup. The  company uses this model when no product vision is evident  at the outset. For example, Project I started with a broader  challenge: “How might we embed the legumes trend within  our products to respond to the increasing healthiness  request?” (see “Project I: Legumes Main Course Dish” on  page 23). The design thinking methodology reframes the  problem in the ideation phase mainly by conducting user  interviews and gathering observations. For example, Project  I’s team realized that users wanted to feel a raw sensation,  have a poly-sensorial --- design thinking in more phases to identify solu- tions. In this broader application, design thinking reframes  the challenge, defines the product’s design principles, and  devises with a solution concept ready to be developed  (Dell’Era et al. [2020] refer to design thinking as outside-in  creative problem solving). Lean Startup is useful for learning about business models  to gain product-market fit (Ries 2011). For those companies  looking to design a product for a new category in which only  limited knowledge about users exists, the Hybrid Model  Matrix suggests using Lean Startup to define the business  model elements. In the Hybrid Model Matrix, Lean Startup  builds on the knowledge gained through the design thinking  that occurs in lieu of the classical Lean Startup phase of prod - uct-solution fit. For the projects highlighted in this study, the  company experimented with business model solutions by  partnering with a retailer or by creating a startup. Agile is useful when focusing on technical details of a  product’s feasibility (production choices) and viability (mar - ket positioning) to define those elements with structured  experiments and users’ iterations. Those iterations are dif- ferent from those that define the business case with Lean  Startup or product solution with design thinking. The com- pany implements Agile when the final solution elements are clear, and it needs to fine-tune the given solutions. As inter - viewee 2 stated during the validation workshop, Agile gets  suggested when it is “not a matter of asking the market if the  product stands . . . [but rather when] you need to test the  market share.” Contingent Applications of Methodologies––The matrix clar - ifies when to activate a specific methodology, but each  methodology can be applied to the company’s context. In  terms of sector, a consumer packaged goods company could  apply Agile development with short iterations and estab- lished retailer agreements, while an automotive
Project  I’s team realized that users wanted to feel a raw sensation,  have a poly-sensorial experience, and express their creativity  while cooking a dish with legumes. Accordingly, the team designed a product idea of “legumes seeds.” In the concept  phase, the design thinking methodology defines the product  concept’s general attributes (packaging, brand choice, or gen - eral recipe) by iteratively developing and testing rough pro- totypes and by defining the design principles—namely, the  attributes that the product needs. Project I design principles  included the shape of the pieces (diamond-like shape), the  number of legumes (a mix of three different legumes), and  the recipe (100 percent legumes flour). At the end of the  concept phase, the design thinking methodology offers a  physical product concept, which the company turns into a  minimum viable product (MVP) to kick off the business case  phase with the Lean Startup methodology. In this phase, the  team launches the MVP on the market to experiment with  unclear business decisions (such as shelf positioning, brand  positioning, or packaging). Once the company validates the  business case, the project follows development, testing, and  launch phases with the Stage-Gate process. The design think - ing phases last between three and nine months, depending  on the depth of the challenge. Once an MVP is developed,  the company can either involve a retailer or form a startup  to run the Lean Startup experiments on the market.Project i: legumes Main course Dish Project I aimed to answer the question: “How might we embed the  legumes trend within our products to respond to the increasing  healthiness request?” Given the company’s limited knowledge of  the users—that is, the legumes lovers or carb-fear users—and the  lack of clarity about the product category, the Design Thinking  Area involved a partner university in the project. The project excluded a pasta solution as healthy users were not  considering carbs a --- the project. The project excluded a pasta solution as healthy users were not  considering carbs a viable option. During the ideation phase, the  design thinking team realized that users wanted to feel a raw sen- sation, by recognizing the authenticity of the ingredients they use  to cook; to have a poly-sensorial experience, by feeling different  texture to perceive the meal as extremely tasty; and to express  their creativity while cooking a dish with legumes. The ideation  phase concluded with a product idea of “legumes seeds” having  different types of pressed legumes flour. During the concept phase, the design thinking team gathered  useful information from the users’ interaction about the shape of  pieces (diamond-like shape), the number of legumes (mix of three different legumes), the number of ingredients per piece (each  grain made of a single legume), and the composition (100 percent  legumes flour). The team tested several prototypes until it chose  the final concept that represented a range of main course or side  dishes that were made of 100 percent legumes flour processed  into diamond-shaped grains. The project entered the business case stage with several open  questions such as which shelf (rice, legumes and cereals, other  shelves), what format (single portion, three people portions, fam- ily pack, other formats), and which brand. The company tested  the first version of the product at a big retailer. After a year of  iterations and tests conducted using Lean Startup principles, the  company structured the market launch of the product and the  project went through the final phases of the Stage-Gate process  (development, testing, and launch). The product is now part of  the company’s offerings in European markets, and the company  is evaluating a US-market launch. Project I is a successful example  of a hybrid model.

In those cases, the involvement  of the Design Thinking Area since the beginning would have  helped because it would have clarified what the drivers are,  what the design principles are, and what the right user expe - rience is.” Phase 4—Decision Variables The company’s official documentation does not specify any  procedure that identifies the most appropriate hybrid model  to use at the beginning of a new project. Stage-Gate is the  only standard process, and managers can modify it by intro- ducing one of the other three methodologies. However, the  choices managers make are not necessarily based on shared  best practices, and they depend on the specific manager or  situation. When asked, our interviewees could not explain  what variables drive management to decide which method- ology to embed in the Stage-Gate process. Interviewees often  provided detailed explanations about why they chose (or  would have chosen) a specific methodology for a project. Knowledge about product category and about users  emerged as crucial discriminant variables to identify the  proper NPD methodologies that hybridize the Stage-Gate  process. For example, regarding knowledge about users,  interviewee 4 reported, “We worked together with the  Design Thinking Area on the legumes snack project  [Project J]. . . . I believe that such deep analyses are  needed when the project involves a new consumer— namely, people interested in a world that the company  does not know yet, because in these cases the Stage-Gate  analyses only are not enough.” According to the interviewees and the company’s official  documentation, financial consideration is an element that  defines project risk assessment and portfolio decisions, and  it is not viewed as a variable that should drive the selection  of the NPD methodology. Interviewee 13 said, “If a project  exceeds a certain amount of CapEx, it is now managed as a  key project, no matter the fact that it
24 | Research-Technology Management The Hybrid Model MatrixAgile–Stage-Gate––Agile development scaffolds the Stage- Gate process in the development and testing phases to  acquire knowledge about some category dynamics. The com - pany uses Stage-Gate to manage previous and successful  phases. For example, Project N had to improve the product  visibility within the market shelf and test different prices (see  “Project N: Granola Bar” on page 24). To do this, the Agile  team iteratively delivered different versions of the product  in six different stores for a period of six months. The team  gathered insights directly from the field through qualitative  (interviews) and quantitative (shelf-rotation measures)  methods and iteratively refined the product variables under  investigation. The Agile team comprises 11 full-time internal  experts who have the authority to make decisions based on  the field analysis. The Agile team presented all results gath- ered in the development and testing gates. Phase 3—NPD Processes Used versus Suggested by  Interviewees For 12 projects out of 20, we found agreement among inter - viewees regarding the NPD processes used and the NPD pro - cesses the respondents suggested. For example, when talking  about Project I, interviewee 13 reported, “The case of the  Legumes Main Course Dish proves that the integration  between emergent methodologies, like design thinking and  Lean Startup, and our classical innovation process makes  sense. . . . The use of design thinking and Lean Startup in  the first phases of the project allowed us to speed up the  development process.” For the remaining eight projects, interviewees suggested  a different process. For instance, when talking about Project  P, interviewee 1 stated, “After the launch, we realized that  the product concept did not work . . . and we found ourselves trying to redesign the solution. . . . It happened because we  have not explored enough. In those cases, the involvement  of the Design
exceeds a certain amount of CapEx, it is now managed as a  key project, no matter the fact that it is just the improvement  of an existing product . . . but the driver to identify innova- tion paths should not be the CapEx of the project.” Our interviewees also indicated that technological knowl - edge should not be a relevant variable in the NPD method- ology selection because every project has to face this issue  during the technical feasibility assessment, and it impacts the  depth and length of the NPD process. Interviewee 13 said,  “Every time we develop a project, we need to face some Knowledge about product category and  about users emerged as crucial  discriminant variables to identify the  proper NPD methodologies that  hybridize the Stage-Gate process.Project N: Granola Bar Project N’s purpose was to develop a variant of an existing granola  bar. During the development and testing NPD phases, Agile devel - opment supported the Stage-Gate process. In the project’s devel - opment phase, the company conducted a feasibility and viability  check. The company needed to understand how to improve the  product visibility within the market shelf, given that the packaging  of the basic version of the product did not reflect its “premium” qualities. It also needed to evaluate whether or not the product  supported a higher price than its basic version. The Agile team  designed several experiments around packaging and price options  and tested them within different stores. The company discussed  the gathered results during the gates. Project N went through  the launch phase of the Stage-Gate process. The product is now  successfully placed within the Italian market.
The Hybrid Model Matrix September—October 2021 | 25 FIGURE 4. NPD projects’ distribution around the identified variablesquestions. Does the technology  exist? Does the company own  the technology? These ques- tions address the feasibility  assessment, which in turn  allows understanding of how  many NPD phases the project  needs to go through.” the Hybrid Model Matrix From our study we determined  two relevant variables that  should inform the selection of  the most suitable NPD method - ology: knowledge about users  and knowledge about product  category. We defined a 2x2  matrix and classified the 20 col - lected projects within the four  quadrants (Figure 4). By placing the 20 projects  within the matrix and observ- ing what NPD process the inter - viewees suggested for each  project, we realized that each  quadrant presented a specific  NPD model (Figure 5). When the knowledge about  users and the category is wide,  Stage-Gate perfectly fits as an  NPD process since all the infor - mation and competence are  inside the company already,  and the company focuses on  minimizing risks. Interviewee  10 expressed this while com- menting on the dark chocolate  project (Project A): “The biscuit  [in its classical form] is one of  the main products of the morn - ing goods category . . . it is  important to have its version  for dark chocolate lovers. . . .  That product must be the best  ever, so every detail needs to be  taken care of. This is just an  improvement project; I do not  think it costs anything.  However, in my opinion, the  obsession has to be maximum  . . . and you use the Stage-Gate  for such a project. You do not  need to explore; you do not  need to experiment.” During Phase 4, we discov- ered that when the company  faces a knowledge gap in terms   FIGURE 5. The Hybrid Model Matrix
26 | Research-Technology Management The Hybrid Model Matrixof category or users, other methodologies need to support  the Stage-Gate process. Low Knowledge about Users/High Category Knowledge––In this  case, the design thinking/Stage-Gate hybrid model enables  the company to learn about users. For instance, Interviewee  6 linked this suggestion to the necessity of confirming the  habits of users to define or validate a product idea before  performing other activities in the Stage-Gate. He said, “There  are cases in which you already have a product, but you want  to adapt it to a wider number of users [Project Q, R, and S].  In those cases, you need a deeper analysis of users than the  one that Stage-Gate can offer. You need to understand if the  market trend you are designing for is a will-o’-the-wisp or  will stand for longer, and if it is worth a new product. . . . A  good initial assessment on users with design thinking fits  such an exploration, rather than the Stage-Gate.” Low Knowledge about Users/Low Category Knowledge––In this  instance, our results suggest using the design thinking and  Lean Startup/Stage-Gate hybrid model. As interviewee 6  explained, “If we decide to enter a new product category  where the user knowledge is minimal, it is impossible to start  the project with the Stage-Gate approach. . . . Stage-Gate  requires data since the beginning, but in these cases, you  have to deal with the fact that you have to collect data while  you are working on the project because data is not available.”  Design thinking addresses the knowledge of the users’ gap  first by defining the product idea during the ideation phase,  and second by defining the “product principles” during the  concept phase. Interviewee 4 expressed this idea recalling  the legumes snack project (Project J): “The [design thinking]  team was able to define not just an idea: the team synthesized  all the gathered insights into a list of design principles and  turned them into the product --- 28 | Research-Technology Management The Hybrid Model MatrixLearning in the Process––The Hybrid Model Matrix helps to  position a project in terms of learning needs—that is, knowl - edge gaps about users or categories—and provides recom- mendations regarding which process might best fulfill those  needs. Based on the matrix, Stage-Gate is useful for projects  that do not need to fulfill a significant learning in terms of  users or category knowledge. Bagno, Salerno, and Oliveira  da Silva (2017) also suggest Stage-Gate for incremental  innovation and not for extreme or radical innovation. For  innovations that require a significant learning effort, the  matrix proposes ways to embed other methodologies within  Stage-Gate. Design thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile have common  pillars, including using prototypes to learn in multidisci- plinary teams (Dosi, Mattarelli, and Vignoli 2020), testing  them with users, and iterating to define the solution pro- gressively. Significant differences also exist among the three  methodologies, and some studies show that if used incor - rectly those methodologies can harm the learning process  (Annosi, Foss, and Martini 2020). Design thinking is useful when the goal is to learn about  users’ habits and needs (Brown 2009). The Hybrid Model  Matrix suggests that use of hybrids with design thinking are  best in situations of limited user knowledge. When the  knowledge of the product category is high, the NPD team  expects the NPD solution to be a variant of a known category,  and the goal of design thinking is to understand how and, if  possible, to embed new users’ needs in the original product  vision (Dell’Era et  al. [2020] refer to design thinking as  inside-out sprint execution). When the company also has  limited knowledge of the product category, it has no prior  definition of a possible solution; therefore the team needs to  implement design thinking in more phases to identify solu- tions. In this broader application, design
all the gathered insights into a list of design principles and  turned them into the product concept. The design thinking  methodology allowed the company to understand a new  consumer.” Similarly, Lean Startup adds information regard - ing the dynamics of the category that are still unknown to  the company, and in particular, the ones that inquire about  the product-market fit. As interviewee 3 stated, “The product  concept the design thinking team came up with [Project J]  did not match with any existing company’s brand, and then  we decided to launch a startup. . . . We were able to assess .  . . different product channels. An e-commerce was launched,  and the product was also tested within the university vending  machines.”High Knowledge about Users/Low Category Knowledge––In this  case, the Agile–Stage-Gate hybrid model seems to fit the com- pany’s lessons learned. This model enters when the company  determines the product-market fit settled, but the company still  needs to learn about “category rules.” For example, Agile iter - ations inquire about product and packaging specifics and how  those elements could impact the production lines or specific  business elements such as price or shelf rotation. Interviewee  1 said, “When the fruit shake project [Project T] entered the  Stage-Gate process, we knew many things about users . . . and  we had many data that fostered the Stage-Gate analysis . . . .  Unfortunately, we entered a new category, and we knew noth - ing about that category dynamics. Nevertheless, we had the  overconfidence to set the packs, the prices, and the shelves  because we were aware of users’ preferences.” Interviewee 1  also shared, “Only after the launch, we realized that the users  did not recognize our product because all the others were struc - tured differently, with a different range of prices, on a deter - mined shelf. I believe that the Agile development process would  have helped to understand the category dynamics.” Validation of
Agile development process would  have helped to understand the category dynamics.” Validation of the Hybrid Model Matrix To validate the Hybrid Model Matrix, we performed a work- shop with 12 participants from different functions. The  attendees were not aware of the Hybrid Model Matrix we  created since we presented the research findings to the com - pany after validation. The workshop goal was to test whether  participants used “knowledge about the category” and  “knowledge about users” as variables that identify the proper  methodology, and whether they would suggest NPD pro- cesses in line with the ones outlined in the Hybrid Model  Matrix. We asked attendees to list some “embryonic” projects  they knew management wanted to develop. We grouped  participants into two groups, and we asked them to choose  a proper NPD process. The groups had to discuss the choices  they made and reach a consensus when they disagreed. The  workshop confirmed our finding that knowledge about users  and knowledge about category are significant decision vari- ables that guide the selection of hybrid models. By placing  the “embryonic” projects around the validated matrix and  observing the selected NPD processes, we found a complete  overlap with the Hybrid Model Matrix. We summarize the  final decision taken by the two groups, reporting one project  per quadrant, out of the eight discussed (Figure 6). How to apply the Hybrid Model Matrix The Hybrid Model Matrix provides four benefits: it supports  decision-making; it helps with evaluating users and category  knowledge; it supports learning; and it facilitates contingent  applications of methodologies. Decision-Making Support––Different types of innovation  projects may require different innovation processes, and  managers need to improve their ability to assess how they  must modify or adapt their use of the Stage-Gate process  (MacCormack et al. 2012). With no decisional supporting  tool, managers might base their decision on their

With no decisional supporting  tool, managers might base their decision on their personal  methodological preferences or fears; on available the Hybrid Model Matrix supports  decision-making and learning, helps  with evaluating users and category  knowledge, and facilitates contingent  applications of methodologies. --- employing the Hybrid Model Matrix in their deci- sion-making, companies can reduce conflicts, align stake- holders, and enhance learning.

The Hybrid Model Matrix September—October 2021 | 27organizational opportunities such as free slots or available  budget for project development from specific methodological  areas (for example, coaches from the Design Thinking Area);  or organizational culture and its eventual resistance towards  certain practices. Every project can be potentially developed  with any methodology. However, since hybrid models are  expensive, the Hybrid Model Matrix can help managers  decide when it is worthwhile to apply one or more of them. User Knowledge and Category Knowledge––User knowledge  and category knowledge are articulated in many elements.  User knowledge includes knowledge of users’ habits and  preferences. Category knowledge includes knowledge about  market dynamics, product price, and supply chain compe- tencies. In theory, any company understands its knowledge  of users and categories; therefore, R&D managers can identify  precisely the most suitable process for starting NPD projects.  However, when we tested the matrix, we found that man- agers could have divergent views regarding the classification of projects into high or low  users and category knowledge,  which sparked relevant discus- sions. When positioning a proj- ect in the matrix quadrants,  managers should engage peers  in their decision-making.  Reaching a shared agreement  on the NPD methodology before  starting the project can prevent  potential issues at later stages. User knowledge and cate- gory knowledge refer to the  company’s own knowledge.  Thus, the matrix has an internal  point of reference. Two different  companies developing the same  project might require different  NPD processes. The internal  definition of the matrix vari- ables offers an excellent advan- tage over other tools that  require considering external  variables such as technical risk  and market risk (MacCormack  et  al. 2012).

particular, the  use of internal information is  more beneficial than using  financial estimates or techno- logical knowledge as decision  variables. In fact, before starting  the project, a company may  struggle to have enough infor - mation to rely on CapEx or  other financial elements for  projects that do not yet have a  solution. Suppose you want to  start an NPD project with  CapEx-reliable estimation. In  that case, you might delay  uncertain projects—for example, where user knowledge and  category knowledge are unknown for the company and  CapEx or other financial estimates are difficult to foresee—in  favor of incremental projects or projects closer to the com- pany domain (where user and category are known). This  bias could lead to an unbalanced innovation portfolio and  could be detrimental to any company not considering proj- ects that might open new business opportunities. Similarly, results do not suggest technological knowledge  among variables that should be considered to define the NPD  methodology selection. Our interviewees stated that tech- nology definition is a problem every project faces in the tech - nical feasibility assessment. Relevant technology should be  defined during the project, as doing so beforehand could  mislead the product definition. Further studies of the matrix  use in other manufacturing contexts could reveal more about  the technological knowledge variable. FIGURE 6. Validation of the Hybrid Model Matrix
Agile development with short iterations and estab- lished retailer agreements, while an automotive company  might apply the same method with long iterations and lead  users’ involvement. In terms of proficiency, a company with  limited proficiency in design thinking could execute its  sprint version (only for the ideation phase) with internal  resources but leverage external consultancy for its extensive  application (that needs problem reframing and concept  definition). Knowing in advance when to employ different meth- odological proficiencies is a big advantage from a human  resources perspective. Large companies can create specific  departments for each methodology within their R&D  operations and then involve methodology specialists only  in the most appropriate phase of NPD projects. Small- and  medium-sized companies that cannot afford to retain staff  proficient in multiple innovation methods (De Waal and  Knott 2019) could activate ad hoc consultancy in specific  phases of the process when they implement a precise  methodology. conclusion Companies that rely solely on Stage-Gate often struggle to  enact new methodologies. Design thinking, Lean Startup,  and Agile require significant investments—in terms of  employee training, dedicated resources, and new organiza- tional structures—and represent an approach that may run  counter to the prevailing organizational culture. The Hybrid  Model Matrix helps companies assess which projects will or  will not benefit from those extra methodological competen- cies. Using the matrix, managers can implement the optimal  process, concentrate on the NPD project and supporting the  appointed teams, and accelerate innovation by focusing the  company resources on the proper process. Companies can  use the matrix to understand what knowledge gaps regarding  users and category the project has to fill before it kicks off.  By employing the Hybrid Model Matrix in their deci- sion-making, companies can reduce conflicts, align

El artículo "The Hybrid Model Matrix: Enhancing Stage-Gate with Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile" de Nicolò Cocchi, Clio Dosi y Matteo Vignoli, publicado en la revista Research-Technology Management, presenta un modelo híbrido que busca optimizar el desarrollo de productos mediante la integración de metodologías contemporáneas de innovación y gestión de proyectos. A continuación, se ofrece un resumen detallado de los puntos clave del texto.

### 1. Contexto y Justificación
El artículo comienza destacando la creciente necesidad de las empresas de innovar de manera más efectiva en un entorno empresarial dinámico. Aunque el modelo Stage-Gate ha sido ampliamente adoptado para el desarrollo de nuevos productos (NPD), presenta limitaciones en términos de flexibilidad y adaptabilidad, lo que ha llevado a la búsqueda de enfoques más integrados.

### 2. Metodologías Integradas
Se describen las metodologías que componen el modelo híbrido:
- **Stage-Gate**: Un enfoque estructurado que divide el proceso de desarrollo en etapas y "puertas" de decisión, permitiendo evaluaciones continuas.
- **Design Thinking**: Un enfoque centrado en el usuario que promueve la creatividad y la innovación a través de la empatía y la experimentación.
- **Lean Startup**: Se enfoca en la creación de productos mínimos viables (MVP) y en la validación de ideas mediante ciclos rápidos de retroalimentación.
- **Agile**: Un enfoque iterativo que permite adaptaciones rápidas y continuas en el desarrollo de productos.

### 3. Propuesta del Modelo Híbrido
El modelo híbrido busca combinar las fortalezas de estas metodologías para crear un proceso más dinámico y adaptable. Se argumenta que esta integración puede mejorar la eficiencia y efectividad del desarrollo de productos, permitiendo a las organizaciones responder más rápidamente a las necesidades del mercado.

### 4. Implementación y Beneficios
La implementación del modelo híbrido requiere la formación de equipos multidisciplinarios que apliquen las diferentes metodologías de manera complementaria. Los beneficios incluyen:
- Mayor capacidad de innovación.
- Mejor alineación con las necesidades del cliente.
- Reducción en el tiempo de lanzamiento al mercado.

### 5. Conclusiones y Futuras Investigaciones
El artículo concluye que la integración de estas metodologías no solo mejora el proceso de desarrollo de productos, sino que también puede transformar la cultura organizacional hacia una más innovadora y adaptable. Se sugiere que futuras investigaciones se centren en la aplicación práctica del modelo en diversas industrias y contextos.

### 6. Referencias Citadas
El artículo menciona diversas referencias relevantes en el campo de la gestión de la innovación, incluyendo trabajos de autores como Roger G. Cooper y Tim Brown, que han explorado temas relacionados con el Design Thinking y la gestión de proyectos.

### 7. Acceso y Publicación
El artículo fue publicado en línea el 19 de agosto de 2021 y está disponible en la plataforma de la revista Research-Technology Management, donde se pueden consultar los términos y condiciones de acceso y uso.

### 8. Detalles Adicionales sobre el Modelo Híbrido
El modelo híbrido se presenta como una herramienta que ayuda a los gerentes a decidir cuándo aplicar metodologías como Design Thinking, Lean Startup o Agile en combinación con el proceso Stage-Gate. Se establece que la matriz presenta cuatro enfoques: el proceso lineal Stage-Gate y tres modelos híbridos que combinan Stage-Gate con las otras metodologías.

### 9. Contexto y Necesidad de Flexibilidad
Se destaca que los procesos lineales tradicionales son insuficientes para manejar la complejidad del NPD actual, que requiere ciclos iterativos y colaboración externa. La innovación en las organizaciones depende de su capacidad para ser flexibles y ágiles.

### 10. Implementación de Modelos Híbridos
Se menciona que algunas organizaciones han implementado con éxito el modelo híbrido Agile-Stage-Gate, lo que ha permitido una mayor participación de los clientes en el proceso de desarrollo y ha mejorado la capacidad de respuesta a las necesidades cambiantes de los consumidores.

### 11. Resultados y Análisis
Los datos recopilados en un estudio de caso se analizaron para identificar las mejores prácticas y los desafíos asociados con la implementación de modelos híbridos. Se busca determinar en qué fases del proceso Stage-Gate se deben integrar metodologías específicas.

### 12. Recomendaciones de la Literatura
Se hace referencia a la literatura existente que sugiere el uso del modelo híbrido Agile-Stage-Gate en iniciativas más inciertas, destacando la necesidad de recursos dedicados para su implementación efectiva.

### 13. Conclusiones Finales
El texto enfatiza la importancia de la combinación de metodologías ágiles con procesos estructurados como Stage-Gate para mejorar la efectividad en el desarrollo de productos, así como la necesidad de adaptar los procesos NPD según las experiencias y sugerencias de los equipos involucrados.

En resumen, el artículo propone un enfoque estructurado y flexible para la gestión del desarrollo de nuevos productos, integrando metodologías contemporáneas que permiten a las organizaciones adaptarse a un entorno dinámico y centrado en el cliente. La "Hybrid Model Matrix" se presenta como una herramienta valiosa para la toma de decisiones en la gestión de proyectos de NPD, facilitando la identificación de la metodología más adecuada para cada proyecto y promoviendo la colaboración entre los miembros del equipo.
