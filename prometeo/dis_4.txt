New tools for laboratory design and management Alain Truchaud, *Tanguy Le Neel, Hugues Brochard, Sophie Malvaux, Marine Moyon, and Murielle Cazaubiel The clinical laboratory is changing from a place of activity based on sample analysis to an in vitro diagnos-tic network. To convince our team, partners, and admin-istrators, we need new comprehensive tools to define astrategy with limited risk of failure or conflicts. Specificquality goals should be established before choosingautomated tools for sample handling, analytical sys-tems, laboratory information systems, communicationsystems, or advanced technologies. A system approachmaps and simplifies the process, based more on afunctional study than on classical disciplines. A custom-er–supplier approach establishes the requirements be-tween partners either inside or outside the laboratory.The quality system must be a management tool, linkingsamples, tasks, information, and documents. Quantita-tive simulation modeling explores different automationalternatives and their impact on laboratory workflow.Finally, integration of results in interactive semirealisticsimulation tools for laboratory design or reengineeringcan be used as communications tools to involve labora-tory professionals in the change of their practice. The clinical laboratory is changing from a place of activity based on sample analysis to an in vitro diagnostic net-work. This evolution is due to technological advances, acost containment policy, and the implementation of sys-temic approach methods for Total Quality Management(TQM) 1[1]. To face this evolution, the design of labora- tories and the work of laboratory professionals mustchange rapidly. Technological tools are available in all theactivities of the clinical laboratory, but we also need newmanagement tools, not instruments but new methods andapproaches used to convince our team, partners, andadministrators to define a strategy with limited risk offailure or conflicts by crossing the frontiers
to define a strategy with limited risk offailure or conflicts by crossing the frontiers between jobsand disciplines. We propose here the synthesis of our European experience in laboratory engineering. Ourmethods were applied to various private or hospitallaboratories of various sizes, and in a specialized labora-tory for clinical research in the pharmaceutical industry. from sample analysis to in vitro diagnostic (ivd) service network Traditionally, clinical laboratory activity could be defined as a qualitative or quantitative determination of an ana-lyte or a cell in a patient sample; analytical systems, dataprocessing, quality control, and good know-how werenecessary to perform sample analysis. Nowadays, all thesteps from sample collection to the reporting of the testresults to the practitioner and the patient are included inquality assurance. These steps can be presented as aquality loop, presented on Fig. 1: The patient sample mustbe collected in the right container inside or outside thelaboratory, according to the doctor’s prescription andaccording to any physiological variations or drug inter-ferences. Samples must then be transported to the labo-ratory without damage, avoiding mechanical, thermal, ordelay problems. By accepting one sample, the clinicallaboratory assumes that this sample is identical to the onecollected from the patient. The clinical laboratory pro-duces validated results, and passes them on with aminimal delay to the prescribing doctor and patient withsome eventual service assistance in the interpretation ofthe results. This is particularly relevant as many laboratories are merging to face cost containment, thus amplifying samplehandling, automation, and information processing. Thisenlargement of the responsibility of the clinical laboratoryinduces the reorganization of the clinical laboratory pro-cess, as is the case in many other activities. strategy to reengineer laboratory process Considering robotic or conveyor belt technologies

bly line processes, starting from raw materials to get a final product after various operating steps. The clinicallaboratory process includes different samples from onepatient, and different levels of investigations involvingvarious automated or manual methods, used in a deduc-tive reasoning: It is a disassembly process [2]. If we consider a large clinical laboratory covering all disciplines and most analyte determinations, we proposethe concept of Technopole: a global structure includingthe management of various analytical systems and know-hows, with various logistical functions to support the IVDnetwork. Considering the management of the analytical systems and know-hows, presented on Fig. 2, after sample sortingand preparation, we have a first level of investigationperformed either by automated systems, which are oftenclosed or dedicated to a group of assays (biochemistryprofiles, cell counting, coagulation testing, immunoas-says, etc.), or by methods with a low level of automationas in bacteriology or parasitology. We emphasize thatso-called “full automated laboratories” [3]cover only the first part of this level of investigation. Because of technological advances allowing the run ofstat samples on the same analytical systems as nonurgent samples, stat runs performed in the core laboratory areconsidered more as a personalized “fast testing service”than as a dedicated workstation. Point-of-care testing anddecentralized stat labs are subcontractors of the corelaboratory, their activity is under the control of thequality-assurance department of the laboratory, and theyare connected to the information network. At the second level, analyses are performed by various disciplines in specialized workcells including either somesophisticated equipment (flow cytometry; separativemethods such as chromatography, electrophoresis, orimage analysis) or activities requiring a controlled envi-ronment such as cell culture or DNA assays. Note thatmost of these specialized activities
envi-ronment such as cell culture or DNA assays. Note thatmost of these specialized activities may be used byresearch and development activities in biotechnologies,bioproduction activities such as cell or gene therapy. These analytical activities must be supported by logis- tical and engineering activities, presented in Fig. 3. Inaddition to secretaryship, documentation unit, purchas-ing office, washing unit, reagent preparation, and dataprocessing, we emphasize some new activities: 1) Sample bank: Owing to various reasons like regula- tions, long-term monitoring of diseases, caution againstmedicolegal problems, and validation of new analyticalmethods, we store an increasing amount of samples. Thisstorage in classical freezers is expensive, space consum-ing, and jeopardizes the quality of the samples in case ofbreakdown. We consider that a computerized samplebank with straws stored in liquid nitrogen will become alogistical activity shared by all the laboratories of thetechnical platform. 2) Quality assurance, as an independent and multidis- ciplinary department, concerns all the steps of the qualityloop from sample collection to results reporting. In addi-tion to the implementation of quality documents, thequality-assurance department is also responsible for themetrological aspects of the laboratory (control of pipettes,weighing scales, spectrophotometers, etc.). 3) Evaluation: New technologies must be evaluated and implemented with standardized protocols to covertechnical, medical, and economical aspects in unbiasedcomparative evaluations involving laboratory techni-cians. Technical aspects include comparisons betweenconfigurations (analytical instruments 1computers 1 environment). The required level of performance is de-fined in the specifications and checked when the newtechnology is implemented. 4) Management and strategy to build partnerships with external partners in industry, other laboratories, researchand development programs, etc. Logistical activities

They do not require high annualbudgets, but save much money by common decisionsbased on a common methodology. These new activities Fig. 1. Quality loop of clinical laboratory activities. Fig. 2. Management of analytical tools and know-how in the IVD network.1710 Truchaud et al.: New laboratory toolsDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/43/9/1709/5641047 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 03 July 2024
imply a complete change of methods and work environ- ment for concerned laboratory personnel. integration of technologies In 1987, Burtis reviewed the evolution from analyticalinstruments to analytical systems [4], and our profession succeeded in adapting new technologies to daily workbecause a good basis of standardization in analyticalmethods was already existing, directed towards the qual-ity of the results. Nearly 10 years later, the same author described in a review [5]how the technological revolution affects the way clinical laboratories are organized, staffed, equipped,and operated. The only way to adapt ourselves to thisnew challenge is to be able to rethink our profession witha global quality-assurance approach issued from ouranalytical know-how, applied to any technology used inthe IVD network, and directed towards the patient. Automated sample handling. Specific quality goals should be established between laboratory professionals beforechoosing automated systems: avoid mistakes requiring anew sample collection; reduce sample volume, secureidentification and tracking all along the process, preser-vation; decrease sample handling, locate and containbiohazard [6]; decrease human labor, number of tubes, and paperwork. Then, these quality goals may be applied to various steps of sample handling: sample transportation, centri-fugation, detection, and aliquoting: ( a) Sample transpor- tation devices: controlled access to the samples, protectionagainst breakage and leakage, separation between sam-ples and documents, easy decontamination, thermal sta-bility, tracking and traceability, time limit; ( b) automated centrifuges: traceability (rotor, speed, duration, and tem-perature), biosafety (isolated area, closed covers for cen-trifugation baskets to avoid aerosols), automated detec-tion of a possible breakage of tubes before further robotichandling, easy decontamination [7];(c) sample detection: volume, clots, hyperlipemia, hemolysis, and hyperbiliru-binemia; ( d)
[7];(c) sample detection: volume, clots, hyperlipemia, hemolysis, and hyperbiliru-binemia; ( d) sample aliquoting: ability to use different sizes of secondary tubes, checking of identification beforealiquoting, no carryover by tips or fluidic device, compat-ibility with sample storage. Automated analytical systems. (a) Sample loading: final control relating to the status of the sample to be analyzedin a specific workstation (volume, clots, hyperlipemia,hemolysis, and hyperbilirubinemia), a possible false iden-tification, and medical and biological history of the pa-tient. We prefer to keep automated sample handlingunder human control, as is the case in automated work-stations, so-called islands of automation. ( b) TQM of the workstation, including the instrument (operating proce-dures and associated records) and environment (stock ofreagents and controls, room temperature and humidity). Laboratory information systems (LIS). Most of these systems were designed mainly to manage patient identificationand data collection from analytical systems; the nextgeneration should integrate quality documents and editquality records. Results should be presented in an attrac-tive synthetic report enriched with the added value of acollective validation by a network of experts of the clinicallaboratory, reinforced by using expert systems [8]. Communication systems. The combination of digital and communication technologies has resulted in the possibil-ity of interconnecting computers at the same or remotesite [5]. These networks are very useful to get scientific information and exchange it with our colleagues aroundthe world. Concerning information about the patients, it isnow very easy to send instantaneously a complete file ofresults anywhere, but we must consider different ques-tions carefully: ( a) Reliability: Are we sure that the results were received? At the right place? ( b) Confidentiality: Is Fig. 3. Logistical and engineering activities in the IVD network.Clinical
( b) Confidentiality: Is Fig. 3. Logistical and engineering activities in the IVD network.Clinical Chemistry 43, No. 9, 1997 1711Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/43/9/1709/5641047 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 03 July 2024
the access to transmitted results limited to the authorized person(s)? ( c) Ethics: What kind of information should we transmit by a given communication system? In whichcases should we transmit a letter or prefer a direct contactwith the patient? Advanced technologies. Rapid advances in measurement technologies [5]are always fascinating for the clinical chemist, but the transfer from research and developmentto IVD activities requires evaluation and standardization: 1) Evaluation: In the past, when we moved from chemical to enzymatic determinations or from flamephotometry to ion-selective electrodes, groups of clinicalchemists designed adapted evaluation protocols that al-lowed the organization of comparative evaluations to geta consensus on technical specifications [9]. Today, we have to design evaluation protocols for robots applied tosample handling, using the quality goals and require-ments of our profession. 2) Metrology: From various industries, we learned that the good reliability of a manufacturing process is greatlyhelped by a perfect control and traceability of environ-mental factors such as temperature and humidity. Inclinical chemistry, the more we are able to reach a lowdetection limit in analyte determination, the more envi-ronmental factors will interfere with the results: temper-ature and humidity in laboratories, and also cooling orwarming devices, electromagnetic fields, atmosphericpollution, and carryover by laboratory personnel, dust,etc. Besides scientific upgrading, we will be able totransfer new technologies from research and developmentto our daily work only if we control the environment andflows in our laboratories. Modern standardization willinclude classical analytical factors and environmentalfactors. change requirements and proposals to achieve the change Integration of the analytical activities of the clinical labo- ratory in a global IVD network implies many changes: 1) The clinical laboratory is no more an entity in itself, and we must
implies many changes: 1) The clinical laboratory is no more an entity in itself, and we must cross the frontiers between jobs, upgradeour knowledge, or find new skilled people. We proposethe customer–supplier approach. 2) Computers are now completely integrated in our daily work for information processing. Samples are moretransported than in the past, sometimes on long distanceswhen collected externally, but also inside the laboratory(internal organization frequently includes different ana-lytical sites). We must find a way to link samples (objectsincluding a patient specimen, a container with a cap, andan identification label), information (sample status atdifferent steps of sample processing, clinical and admin-istrative information, results), and the tasks to be per-formed with associated documents and human addedvalue. We will propose a method to manage and use thequality system.2) Automation: To answer financial restraint, the labo- ratory manager must be sure of his decision: Quantitativesimulations allow exploration of different alternatives andcomparison of their impact on laboratory workflow. Wewill review some commercialized tools in this domain. 3) To help the integration of new practices and of existing and future new technologies under the frame ofTQM, we have to redesign the laboratory with a flexiblearchitecture optimizing movements of people, samples,and consumables. We developed an interactive semireal-istic simulation approach. customer–supplier approach The modern relationship between clinical laboratory pro-fessionals and industry is not limited to a negotiationabout prices but includes many other aspects like thequality and performance of the products according tospecific needs, delivery respecting given days and hours,maintenance of instruments, etc. This relationship may besummarized by Fig. 4a: The supplier (with a know-how)and the customer (with needs) must establish a dialogueto specify the requirements of both sides in a writtencontract.
needs) must establish a dialogueto specify the requirements of both sides in a writtencontract. We extended this approach to the internal or external relations of the clinical laboratory because it allows adiscussion between people of different professional cul-tures in a common language: A first example is samplecollection (Fig. 4b): Because the quality of the resultsdepends on the sample collection and transport, thesample collector, the “supplier” with a know-how insample collection and in direct contact with the patient,must discuss with the clinical laboratory scientist, the“customer” with needs concerning sample integrity andcorrect identification, ways to fix the requirements ofsample collection, how to transmit information, and sam-ple transportation. A second example is the negotiationbetween the clinical laboratory, the “supplier” of results,and the medical practitioner, the “customer” with needscorresponding to a specific clinical activity (Fig. 4c). Theymust agree with each other to establish some objectivecriteria for results validation, some possible assistance ininterpretation, acceptable delays, and how to report re-sults. management and use of the quality system A quality-assurance system involves the implementationof three levels of quality documents: ( a) organizational documents (upper level): general procedures; ( b) opera- tional documents (intermediate level): operating proce-dures; ( c) trace documents (lower level): records. First, the general procedures describe the organization of a sector of activity by answering the general questionsof who does what, and eventually where and when. Theyalso answer the question of how in a general way and byreferring to some operating procedures. As the generalprocedures describe an organization, they are organiza-tional documents.1712 Truchaud et al.: New laboratory toolsDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/43/9/1709/5641047 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 03 July 2024
The operating procedures are the documents that con- tain the instructions of work and enable the operator toachieve a given task. For this reason, they must beoperational documents and available at the workstationwhere they are required. The operating procedures some-times refer to the completion of records that correspond tothe last level of quality documents. The records are the documents that allow the traceabil- ity of the operations done by an operator. They includechecklists of periodic maintenance completed by the op-erator, tables for the management of reagent lots, and theresults of certain tests such as results of calibrations,quality controls, patient analyses, etc. These documentsare the record of what happened on a certain date andconstitute the memory of the laboratory as they allow theanalysis of the cause of an error or a dysfunction. Theymay also be used, for instance, to find patient analysesdone with a defective reagent lot. Integration of the quality system in the daily work of the clinical laboratory. The quality system of the clinical laboratory must be more than an answer for the inspection of thelaboratory, more than quality documents that are neveropened by the end user at the workcell. The qualitysystem must be designed by following the daily work ofthe laboratory personnel, with different levels of utiliza- tion depending on the experience of a given technician orsecretary. During a previous experiment in simulation modeling of the activity of clinical laboratories, we tested variousmethods and found that the only comprehensive methodsfor end users were flowcharts or flow diagrams used byGodolphin et al. to describe a process [10]. With a maxi- mum of five symbols, we were able to describe all thesteps of any processes in all disciplines. Attached to this leading flowchart, which can be fixed on the cover of the log book of a workcell, we present thedetailed documents that are necessary for implementing agiven step of the process, and the
thedetailed documents that are necessary for implementing agiven step of the process, and the traceability records.These documents are contained inside the log book. Example of quality documents concerning a workcell around an automated analytical system. These documents are pre- sented in Fig. 5: On the left, the work sequence empha-sizes the steps where decisions must be taken and even-tually recorded by the operator. In the middle,corresponding operating procedures explain the technicaltasks but also try to anticipate the problems and thesolutions for these problems; some operating proceduresare general (biosafety, results reporting, waste disposal),but most of them are specific to the workcell. On the rightare the records that certify that the daily work wasperformed in accordance with the quality system. Byusing this method, we found that it was possible to linkinformation and samples to the tasks to be performedwith a fast access to different levels of operating proce-dures and associated records, depending on the eventsand the skill of the operator. This approach is also a goodbasis to study the added value of the laboratory personnelbefore initiating an automation project. Nowadays, commercialized LIS are able to handle only quality-control results but not quality-assurance docu-ments. Quality-assurance documents can be managedelectronically by using custom databases or hypertextdocuments. quantitative simulation tools Clinical laboratory management requires a system ap-proach including many aspects other than the analysis:total turnaround time from sample collection to issuingthe result to the clinician, cost containment, biosafety, andregulations. More than analytical speed, sample handling is one of the major problems in clinical laboratories, involvingmany manual processing steps. To reengineer samplehandling, different steps should be followed: map theprocess, measure the performance, model, show the re-sults through simulation tools, simplify and

To answer financial restraint, the laboratory manager must be sure of his decision: Quantitative simulation toolsallow exploration of different alternatives in laboratory Fig. 4.

automation and compare their impact on laboratory workflow. [11,12]. These tools are computation tools, useful to determine if one or two analytical systems areneeded, the number of operators at different times of theday, the impact of a modification, or a breakdown at onestep of the overall process. The results of these simula-tions are often given in Tables; only some expensivesoftwares like Witness (AT&T) or Siman (Systems Mod-eling) show real-time animation with moving shapessymbolizing the process; they cannot be used to commu-nicate with laboratory personnel about a new organiza-tion of the laboratory. interactive semirealistic simulation approach Modeling and computing laboratory workflow is onlyhalf of the way. As nobody likes change and everybody isafraid of being out of work, the personnel must beinvolved in laboratory engineering. To improve biosafety, the laboratory should be orga- nized and designed in a way that makes the implemen-tation of biosafety and waste management operatingprocedures by laboratory personnel easy and fast, thusimproving their overall productivity.We developed in our laboratory an interactive semire- alistic simulation approach to get feedback from person-nel and make them feel confident in the project. The first step is to distinguish inside the laboratory between different areas with various levels of eventualbiohazard and fix the rules according to the specificpractice of the laboratory team. Then we prepared a firstschematic drawing of the laboratory with the differentareas on the computer, and we simulated the flows.During a meeting with the team, on request, we can showand animate the flows of different categories of people(technicians, administrative staff, manufacturers, pa-tients), samples (collected in or outside the laboratory),waste, and consumables. We can combine the differentflows, demonstrate unacceptable overlapping in the exist-ing organization, and discuss improvements with thelaboratory team. In Fig. 6 we
in the exist-ing organization, and discuss improvements with thelaboratory team. In Fig. 6 we present an example concerning the flow of people in a project of a 500 m 2laboratory with two floors. The first draft is presented in Fig. 6a: Reception, waitingroom, and sample collection rooms for outpatients arelocated on the upper floor. Secretariat, laboratories,changing rooms, restroom, and waste storage are locateddownstairs. Biohazardous zones are colored in gray. One can click on any of the three icons: people, samples, and consumables. For our example, we clickedon people. At the base of the screen (Fig. 6b), differentcategories of people are presented with different colors(technicians, red; administration, yellow; patients, purple;messengers, blue; suppliers, green). Each category may beactivated separately by clicking on the correspondingicon. On the selected screen presented here, all the flowsare figured in colored lines corresponding to the differentcategories, and shapes of technicians (red) and adminis-trative personnel (yellow) are moving along red andyellow lines. On this screen, it is obvious that, upstairs, patients and messengers bringing samples from outpatients to thelaboratory are mixed at the reception; downstairs, every-body is circulating through the same corridor, and admin-istrative people have to cross a biohazardous zone. From a first meeting, we changed the design of the laboratory to get the draft presented in Fig. 6c, includingalso improvements in the flow of samples and consum-ables. Concerning the people, messengers enter down-stairs and deliver the samples to a technical reception andsorting area; the biohazardous zone is completely sepa-rated from the administrative area. The advantage of this method is the involvement of laboratory personnel in a new practice: The project be-comes their project. Such a simulation also helps to improve the dialogue with decision makers and archi-tects, by justifying specific requests of the

process must be reengineered in a system approach, including analytical systems, know-how, and logisticalfunctions. Various levels of investigations, from highlyautomated systems to manual specialized methods,should be used in deductive reasoning to solve theindividual enigma of a patient case. New technologies,including communication technologies, should be evalu- ated from a clinical laboratory point of view, and specifi-cations should be established. The IVD network implies anetwork of expertises and the ability to set up feasiblerequirements with a customer–supplier approach. Thequality system must be the frame of the management, andalso a practical assistance to the daily work. To improvelaboratory organization and productivity, we need com-putation tools to make the good decisions, but we alsoneed multimedia interactive methods to involve the teamin their changing practice. The question today for laboratory professionals is, “To be or not to be in the future of the IVD network.” The onlyway to adapt ourselves is to use new management methodsto reengineer our profession and select emerging technolo-gies with a global quality-assurance approach issued fromour analytical know-how, directed towards the patient.

New tools for laboratory design and management Alain Truchaud, *Tanguy Le Neel, Hugues Brochard, Sophie Malvaux, Marine Moyon, and Murielle Cazaubiel The clinical laboratory is changing from a place of activity based on sample analysis to an in vitro diagnos-tic network. To convince our team, partners, and admin-istrators, we need new comprehensive tools to define astrategy with limited risk of failure or conflicts. Specificquality goals should be established before choosingautomated tools for sample handling, analytical sys-tems, laboratory information systems, communicationsystems, or advanced technologies. A system approachmaps and simplifies the process, based more on afunctional study than on classical disciplines. A custom-er–supplier approach establishes the requirements be-tween partners either inside or outside the laboratory.The quality system must be a management tool, linkingsamples, tasks, information, and documents. Quantita-tive simulation modeling explores different automationalternatives and their impact on laboratory workflow.Finally, integration of results in interactive semirealisticsimulation tools for laboratory design or reengineeringcan be used as communications tools to involve labora-tory professionals in the change of their practice. The clinical laboratory is changing from a place of activity based on sample analysis to an in vitro diagnostic net-work. This evolution is due to technological advances, acost containment policy, and the implementation of sys-temic approach methods for Total Quality Management(TQM) 1[1]. To face this evolution, the design of labora- tories and the work of laboratory professionals mustchange rapidly. Technological tools are available in all theactivities of the clinical laboratory, but we also need newmanagement tools, not instruments but new methods andapproaches used to convince our team, partners, andadministrators to define a strategy with limited risk offailure or conflicts by crossing the frontiers
to define a strategy with limited risk offailure or conflicts by crossing the frontiers between jobsand disciplines. We propose here the synthesis of our European experience in laboratory engineering. Ourmethods were applied to various private or hospitallaboratories of various sizes, and in a specialized labora-tory for clinical research in the pharmaceutical industry. from sample analysis to in vitro diagnostic (ivd) service network Traditionally, clinical laboratory activity could be defined as a qualitative or quantitative determination of an ana-lyte or a cell in a patient sample; analytical systems, dataprocessing, quality control, and good know-how werenecessary to perform sample analysis. Nowadays, all thesteps from sample collection to the reporting of the testresults to the practitioner and the patient are included inquality assurance. These steps can be presented as aquality loop, presented on Fig. 1: The patient sample mustbe collected in the right container inside or outside thelaboratory, according to the doctor’s prescription andaccording to any physiological variations or drug inter-ferences. Samples must then be transported to the labo-ratory without damage, avoiding mechanical, thermal, ordelay problems. By accepting one sample, the clinicallaboratory assumes that this sample is identical to the onecollected from the patient. The clinical laboratory pro-duces validated results, and passes them on with aminimal delay to the prescribing doctor and patient withsome eventual service assistance in the interpretation ofthe results. This is particularly relevant as many laboratories are merging to face cost containment, thus amplifying samplehandling, automation, and information processing. Thisenlargement of the responsibility of the clinical laboratoryinduces the reorganization of the clinical laboratory pro-cess, as is the case in many other activities. strategy to reengineer laboratory process Considering robotic or conveyor belt technologies

bly line processes, starting from raw materials to get a final product after various operating steps. The clinicallaboratory process includes different samples from onepatient, and different levels of investigations involvingvarious automated or manual methods, used in a deduc-tive reasoning: It is a disassembly process [2]. If we consider a large clinical laboratory covering all disciplines and most analyte determinations, we proposethe concept of Technopole: a global structure includingthe management of various analytical systems and know-hows, with various logistical functions to support the IVDnetwork. Considering the management of the analytical systems and know-hows, presented on Fig. 2, after sample sortingand preparation, we have a first level of investigationperformed either by automated systems, which are oftenclosed or dedicated to a group of assays (biochemistryprofiles, cell counting, coagulation testing, immunoas-says, etc.), or by methods with a low level of automationas in bacteriology or parasitology. We emphasize thatso-called “full automated laboratories” [3]cover only the first part of this level of investigation. Because of technological advances allowing the run ofstat samples on the same analytical systems as nonurgent samples, stat runs performed in the core laboratory areconsidered more as a personalized “fast testing service”than as a dedicated workstation. Point-of-care testing anddecentralized stat labs are subcontractors of the corelaboratory, their activity is under the control of thequality-assurance department of the laboratory, and theyare connected to the information network. At the second level, analyses are performed by various disciplines in specialized workcells including either somesophisticated equipment (flow cytometry; separativemethods such as chromatography, electrophoresis, orimage analysis) or activities requiring a controlled envi-ronment such as cell culture or DNA assays. Note thatmost of these specialized activities
envi-ronment such as cell culture or DNA assays. Note thatmost of these specialized activities may be used byresearch and development activities in biotechnologies,bioproduction activities such as cell or gene therapy. These analytical activities must be supported by logis- tical and engineering activities, presented in Fig. 3. Inaddition to secretaryship, documentation unit, purchas-ing office, washing unit, reagent preparation, and dataprocessing, we emphasize some new activities: 1) Sample bank: Owing to various reasons like regula- tions, long-term monitoring of diseases, caution againstmedicolegal problems, and validation of new analyticalmethods, we store an increasing amount of samples. Thisstorage in classical freezers is expensive, space consum-ing, and jeopardizes the quality of the samples in case ofbreakdown. We consider that a computerized samplebank with straws stored in liquid nitrogen will become alogistical activity shared by all the laboratories of thetechnical platform. 2) Quality assurance, as an independent and multidis- ciplinary department, concerns all the steps of the qualityloop from sample collection to results reporting. In addi-tion to the implementation of quality documents, thequality-assurance department is also responsible for themetrological aspects of the laboratory (control of pipettes,weighing scales, spectrophotometers, etc.). 3) Evaluation: New technologies must be evaluated and implemented with standardized protocols to covertechnical, medical, and economical aspects in unbiasedcomparative evaluations involving laboratory techni-cians. Technical aspects include comparisons betweenconfigurations (analytical instruments 1computers 1 environment). The required level of performance is de-fined in the specifications and checked when the newtechnology is implemented. 4) Management and strategy to build partnerships with external partners in industry, other laboratories, researchand development programs, etc. Logistical activities --- in industry, other laboratories, researchand development programs, etc. Logistical activities are performed by a part of the laboratory personnel obtained from the productivity ben-efits of a global management and automation programs ofall the laboratories. They do not require high annualbudgets, but save much money by common decisionsbased on a common methodology. These new activities Fig. 1. Quality loop of clinical laboratory activities. Fig. 2. Management of analytical tools and know-how in the IVD network.1710 Truchaud et al.: New laboratory toolsDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/43/9/1709/5641047 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 03 July 2024
imply a complete change of methods and work environ- ment for concerned laboratory personnel. integration of technologies In 1987, Burtis reviewed the evolution from analyticalinstruments to analytical systems [4], and our profession succeeded in adapting new technologies to daily workbecause a good basis of standardization in analyticalmethods was already existing, directed towards the qual-ity of the results. Nearly 10 years later, the same author described in a review [5]how the technological revolution affects the way clinical laboratories are organized, staffed, equipped,and operated. The only way to adapt ourselves to thisnew challenge is to be able to rethink our profession witha global quality-assurance approach issued from ouranalytical know-how, applied to any technology used inthe IVD network, and directed towards the patient. Automated sample handling. Specific quality goals should be established between laboratory professionals beforechoosing automated systems: avoid mistakes requiring anew sample collection; reduce sample volume, secureidentification and tracking all along the process, preser-vation; decrease sample handling, locate and containbiohazard [6]; decrease human labor, number of tubes, and paperwork. Then, these quality goals may be applied to various steps of sample handling: sample transportation, centri-fugation, detection, and aliquoting: ( a) Sample transpor- tation devices: controlled access to the samples, protectionagainst breakage and leakage, separation between sam-ples and documents, easy decontamination, thermal sta-bility, tracking and traceability, time limit; ( b) automated centrifuges: traceability (rotor, speed, duration, and tem-perature), biosafety (isolated area, closed covers for cen-trifugation baskets to avoid aerosols), automated detec-tion of a possible breakage of tubes before further robotichandling, easy decontamination [7];(c) sample detection: volume, clots, hyperlipemia, hemolysis, and hyperbiliru-binemia; ( d)
[7];(c) sample detection: volume, clots, hyperlipemia, hemolysis, and hyperbiliru-binemia; ( d) sample aliquoting: ability to use different sizes of secondary tubes, checking of identification beforealiquoting, no carryover by tips or fluidic device, compat-ibility with sample storage. Automated analytical systems. (a) Sample loading: final control relating to the status of the sample to be analyzedin a specific workstation (volume, clots, hyperlipemia,hemolysis, and hyperbilirubinemia), a possible false iden-tification, and medical and biological history of the pa-tient. We prefer to keep automated sample handlingunder human control, as is the case in automated work-stations, so-called islands of automation. ( b) TQM of the workstation, including the instrument (operating proce-dures and associated records) and environment (stock ofreagents and controls, room temperature and humidity). Laboratory information systems (LIS). Most of these systems were designed mainly to manage patient identificationand data collection from analytical systems; the nextgeneration should integrate quality documents and editquality records. Results should be presented in an attrac-tive synthetic report enriched with the added value of acollective validation by a network of experts of the clinicallaboratory, reinforced by using expert systems [8]. Communication systems. The combination of digital and communication technologies has resulted in the possibil-ity of interconnecting computers at the same or remotesite [5]. These networks are very useful to get scientific information and exchange it with our colleagues aroundthe world. Concerning information about the patients, it isnow very easy to send instantaneously a complete file ofresults anywhere, but we must consider different ques-tions carefully: ( a) Reliability: Are we sure that the results were received? At the right place? ( b) Confidentiality: Is Fig. 3. Logistical and engineering activities in the IVD network.Clinical
( b) Confidentiality: Is Fig. 3. Logistical and engineering activities in the IVD network.Clinical Chemistry 43, No. 9, 1997 1711Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/43/9/1709/5641047 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 03 July 2024
the access to transmitted results limited to the authorized person(s)? ( c) Ethics: What kind of information should we transmit by a given communication system? In whichcases should we transmit a letter or prefer a direct contactwith the patient? Advanced technologies. Rapid advances in measurement technologies [5]are always fascinating for the clinical chemist, but the transfer from research and developmentto IVD activities requires evaluation and standardization: 1) Evaluation: In the past, when we moved from chemical to enzymatic determinations or from flamephotometry to ion-selective electrodes, groups of clinicalchemists designed adapted evaluation protocols that al-lowed the organization of comparative evaluations to geta consensus on technical specifications [9]. Today, we have to design evaluation protocols for robots applied tosample handling, using the quality goals and require-ments of our profession. 2) Metrology: From various industries, we learned that the good reliability of a manufacturing process is greatlyhelped by a perfect control and traceability of environ-mental factors such as temperature and humidity. Inclinical chemistry, the more we are able to reach a lowdetection limit in analyte determination, the more envi-ronmental factors will interfere with the results: temper-ature and humidity in laboratories, and also cooling orwarming devices, electromagnetic fields, atmosphericpollution, and carryover by laboratory personnel, dust,etc. Besides scientific upgrading, we will be able totransfer new technologies from research and developmentto our daily work only if we control the environment andflows in our laboratories. Modern standardization willinclude classical analytical factors and environmentalfactors. change requirements and proposals to achieve the change Integration of the analytical activities of the clinical labo- ratory in a global IVD network implies many changes: 1) The clinical laboratory is no more an entity in itself, and we must
implies many changes: 1) The clinical laboratory is no more an entity in itself, and we must cross the frontiers between jobs, upgradeour knowledge, or find new skilled people. We proposethe customer–supplier approach. 2) Computers are now completely integrated in our daily work for information processing. Samples are moretransported than in the past, sometimes on long distanceswhen collected externally, but also inside the laboratory(internal organization frequently includes different ana-lytical sites). We must find a way to link samples (objectsincluding a patient specimen, a container with a cap, andan identification label), information (sample status atdifferent steps of sample processing, clinical and admin-istrative information, results), and the tasks to be per-formed with associated documents and human addedvalue. We will propose a method to manage and use thequality system.2) Automation: To answer financial restraint, the labo- ratory manager must be sure of his decision: Quantitativesimulations allow exploration of different alternatives andcomparison of their impact on laboratory workflow. Wewill review some commercialized tools in this domain. 3) To help the integration of new practices and of existing and future new technologies under the frame ofTQM, we have to redesign the laboratory with a flexiblearchitecture optimizing movements of people, samples,and consumables. We developed an interactive semireal-istic simulation approach. customer–supplier approach The modern relationship between clinical laboratory pro-fessionals and industry is not limited to a negotiationabout prices but includes many other aspects like thequality and performance of the products according tospecific needs, delivery respecting given days and hours,maintenance of instruments, etc. This relationship may besummarized by Fig. 4a: The supplier (with a know-how)and the customer (with needs) must establish a dialogueto specify the requirements of both sides in a writtencontract.
needs) must establish a dialogueto specify the requirements of both sides in a writtencontract. We extended this approach to the internal or external relations of the clinical laboratory because it allows adiscussion between people of different professional cul-tures in a common language: A first example is samplecollection (Fig. 4b): Because the quality of the resultsdepends on the sample collection and transport, thesample collector, the “supplier” with a know-how insample collection and in direct contact with the patient,must discuss with the clinical laboratory scientist, the“customer” with needs concerning sample integrity andcorrect identification, ways to fix the requirements ofsample collection, how to transmit information, and sam-ple transportation. A second example is the negotiationbetween the clinical laboratory, the “supplier” of results,and the medical practitioner, the “customer” with needscorresponding to a specific clinical activity (Fig. 4c). Theymust agree with each other to establish some objectivecriteria for results validation, some possible assistance ininterpretation, acceptable delays, and how to report re-sults. management and use of the quality system A quality-assurance system involves the implementationof three levels of quality documents: ( a) organizational documents (upper level): general procedures; ( b) opera- tional documents (intermediate level): operating proce-dures; ( c) trace documents (lower level): records. First, the general procedures describe the organization of a sector of activity by answering the general questionsof who does what, and eventually where and when. Theyalso answer the question of how in a general way and byreferring to some operating procedures. As the generalprocedures describe an organization, they are organiza-tional documents.1712 Truchaud et al.: New laboratory toolsDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/43/9/1709/5641047 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 03 July 2024
The operating procedures are the documents that con- tain the instructions of work and enable the operator toachieve a given task. For this reason, they must beoperational documents and available at the workstationwhere they are required. The operating procedures some-times refer to the completion of records that correspond tothe last level of quality documents. The records are the documents that allow the traceabil- ity of the operations done by an operator. They includechecklists of periodic maintenance completed by the op-erator, tables for the management of reagent lots, and theresults of certain tests such as results of calibrations,quality controls, patient analyses, etc. These documentsare the record of what happened on a certain date andconstitute the memory of the laboratory as they allow theanalysis of the cause of an error or a dysfunction. Theymay also be used, for instance, to find patient analysesdone with a defective reagent lot. Integration of the quality system in the daily work of the clinical laboratory. The quality system of the clinical laboratory must be more than an answer for the inspection of thelaboratory, more than quality documents that are neveropened by the end user at the workcell. The qualitysystem must be designed by following the daily work ofthe laboratory personnel, with different levels of utiliza- tion depending on the experience of a given technician orsecretary. During a previous experiment in simulation modeling of the activity of clinical laboratories, we tested variousmethods and found that the only comprehensive methodsfor end users were flowcharts or flow diagrams used byGodolphin et al. to describe a process [10]. With a maxi- mum of five symbols, we were able to describe all thesteps of any processes in all disciplines. Attached to this leading flowchart, which can be fixed on the cover of the log book of a workcell, we present thedetailed documents that are necessary for implementing agiven step of the process, and the
thedetailed documents that are necessary for implementing agiven step of the process, and the traceability records.These documents are contained inside the log book. Example of quality documents concerning a workcell around an automated analytical system. These documents are pre- sented in Fig. 5: On the left, the work sequence empha-sizes the steps where decisions must be taken and even-tually recorded by the operator. In the middle,corresponding operating procedures explain the technicaltasks but also try to anticipate the problems and thesolutions for these problems; some operating proceduresare general (biosafety, results reporting, waste disposal),but most of them are specific to the workcell. On the rightare the records that certify that the daily work wasperformed in accordance with the quality system. Byusing this method, we found that it was possible to linkinformation and samples to the tasks to be performedwith a fast access to different levels of operating proce-dures and associated records, depending on the eventsand the skill of the operator. This approach is also a goodbasis to study the added value of the laboratory personnelbefore initiating an automation project. Nowadays, commercialized LIS are able to handle only quality-control results but not quality-assurance docu-ments. Quality-assurance documents can be managedelectronically by using custom databases or hypertextdocuments. quantitative simulation tools Clinical laboratory management requires a system ap-proach including many aspects other than the analysis:total turnaround time from sample collection to issuingthe result to the clinician, cost containment, biosafety, andregulations. More than analytical speed, sample handling is one of the major problems in clinical laboratories, involvingmany manual processing steps. To reengineer samplehandling, different steps should be followed: map theprocess, measure the performance, model, show the re-sults through simulation tools, simplify and
measure the performance, model, show the re-sults through simulation tools, simplify and redesign, getthe consensus [10]. To answer financial restraint, the laboratory manager must be sure of his decision: Quantitative simulation toolsallow exploration of different alternatives in laboratory Fig. 4.

automation and compare their impact on laboratory workflow. [11,12]. These tools are computation tools, useful to determine if one or two analytical systems areneeded, the number of operators at different times of theday, the impact of a modification, or a breakdown at onestep of the overall process. The results of these simula-tions are often given in Tables; only some expensivesoftwares like Witness (AT&T) or Siman (Systems Mod-eling) show real-time animation with moving shapessymbolizing the process; they cannot be used to commu-nicate with laboratory personnel about a new organiza-tion of the laboratory. interactive semirealistic simulation approach Modeling and computing laboratory workflow is onlyhalf of the way. As nobody likes change and everybody isafraid of being out of work, the personnel must beinvolved in laboratory engineering. To improve biosafety, the laboratory should be orga- nized and designed in a way that makes the implemen-tation of biosafety and waste management operatingprocedures by laboratory personnel easy and fast, thusimproving their overall productivity.We developed in our laboratory an interactive semire- alistic simulation approach to get feedback from person-nel and make them feel confident in the project. The first step is to distinguish inside the laboratory between different areas with various levels of eventualbiohazard and fix the rules according to the specificpractice of the laboratory team. Then we prepared a firstschematic drawing of the laboratory with the differentareas on the computer, and we simulated the flows.During a meeting with the team, on request, we can showand animate the flows of different categories of people(technicians, administrative staff, manufacturers, pa-tients), samples (collected in or outside the laboratory),waste, and consumables. We can combine the differentflows, demonstrate unacceptable overlapping in the exist-ing organization, and discuss improvements with thelaboratory team. In Fig. 6 we
in the exist-ing organization, and discuss improvements with thelaboratory team. In Fig. 6 we present an example concerning the flow of people in a project of a 500 m 2laboratory with two floors. The first draft is presented in Fig. 6a: Reception, waitingroom, and sample collection rooms for outpatients arelocated on the upper floor. Secretariat, laboratories,changing rooms, restroom, and waste storage are locateddownstairs. Biohazardous zones are colored in gray. One can click on any of the three icons: people, samples, and consumables. For our example, we clickedon people. At the base of the screen (Fig. 6b), differentcategories of people are presented with different colors(technicians, red; administration, yellow; patients, purple;messengers, blue; suppliers, green). Each category may beactivated separately by clicking on the correspondingicon. On the selected screen presented here, all the flowsare figured in colored lines corresponding to the differentcategories, and shapes of technicians (red) and adminis-trative personnel (yellow) are moving along red andyellow lines. On this screen, it is obvious that, upstairs, patients and messengers bringing samples from outpatients to thelaboratory are mixed at the reception; downstairs, every-body is circulating through the same corridor, and admin-istrative people have to cross a biohazardous zone. From a first meeting, we changed the design of the laboratory to get the draft presented in Fig. 6c, includingalso improvements in the flow of samples and consum-ables. Concerning the people, messengers enter down-stairs and deliver the samples to a technical reception andsorting area; the biohazardous zone is completely sepa-rated from the administrative area. The advantage of this method is the involvement of laboratory personnel in a new practice: The project be-comes their project. Such a simulation also helps to improve the dialogue with decision makers and archi-tects, by justifying specific requests of the

process must be reengineered in a system approach, including analytical systems, know-how, and logisticalfunctions. Various levels of investigations, from highlyautomated systems to manual specialized methods,should be used in deductive reasoning to solve theindividual enigma of a patient case. New technologies,including communication technologies, should be evalu- ated from a clinical laboratory point of view, and specifi-cations should be established. The IVD network implies anetwork of expertises and the ability to set up feasiblerequirements with a customer–supplier approach. Thequality system must be the frame of the management, andalso a practical assistance to the daily work. To improvelaboratory organization and productivity, we need com-putation tools to make the good decisions, but we alsoneed multimedia interactive methods to involve the teamin their changing practice. The question today for laboratory professionals is, “To be or not to be in the future of the IVD network.” The onlyway to adapt ourselves is to use new management methodsto reengineer our profession and select emerging technolo-gies with a global quality-assurance approach issued fromour analytical know-how, directed towards the patient.
