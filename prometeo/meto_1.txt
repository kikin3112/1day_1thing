Objective. To review literature pertaining to entrepreneurship in pharmacy practice, education, and the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) identiﬁed for pharmacist entrepreneurs. Findings. In terms of pharmacy practice, entrepreneurship was most frequently identiﬁed with innova- tion and creativity to develop new opportunities for pharmacists. The most frequent role for entrepreneur- ship in pharmacy education was related to schools putting a greater emphasis on innovation, creativity, or divergent thinking. Risk-taking and creativity/innovation were the most frequently identiﬁed KSAs, with 17 (63.0%) manuscripts mentioning these as important for a pharmacist entrepreneur. Other KSAs pertaining to pharmacy entrepreneurship that were mentioned in the articles included self-starter,management, proactivity, communication, strategic planning, positivity, decision-making, teamwork, versatility, marketing, critical thinking, competitiveness, proposal development, numeracy, technology, self-reﬂection, persistence, social responsibility, and cultural competence. Summary. No consensus for entrepreneurship in pharmacy practice or education currently exists. In order to improve instructional design and assessment for pharmacy entrepreneurship education, a core set of KSAs for a pharmacist entrepreneur construct must be identiﬁed. The most commonly cited KSAs in related literature that are not already part of the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education standards include risk-taking, strategic planning, marketing,
Council for Pharmacy Education standards include risk-taking, strategic planning, marketing, competitiveness, and social responsibility. These may serve as a starting point for enhancing pharmacy curricula to embrace pharmacist entrepreneurship. Keywords: entrepreneur, knowledge, skills, attitudes INTRODUCTION Entrepreneurial outcomes in education refer to new venture development, business start-ups, and job creation contributing to economic growth and development.1 More broadly, entrepreneurship can be deﬁned as identi-fying or creating new opportunities within uncertain en-vironments. 2Business school experts have debated about whether entrepreneurship should be considered a con- struct for the classroom, or whether real-world experience is more appropriate as a delivery method for this type of education.2,3 Within pharmacy education, entrepreneurship has been identified as a key factor driving innovation in phar- macy practice. To guide the Academy in this area, the Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education(CAPE) included entrepreneurship within domains in 2013. This action influenced the Accreditation Councilfor Pharmacy Education (ACPE) to include entrepreneur- ship within the standards used to evaluate professional pharmacy programs in 2016. 4,5The 2010-2011 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) Academic Affairs Standing Committee identiﬁed entrepreneurshipas an affective domain trait, thereby enabling students to develop sustainable practice models. 6The Committee suggested using Rubino and Freshman’s entrepreneur- ship competency clusters (decision making, strategic thinking, risk taking, conﬁdence building, communicat- ing ideas, motivating team members, tolerance of ambi- guity, and internal locus of control) as a potential framework for developing a pharmacy entrepreneur.6,7 Many schools have developed educational programs toaddress entrepreneurship in pharmacy.

entrepreneurship in pharmacy. In addition to the lectures taught in traditional pharmacy management courses, multiple schools now offer certiﬁcate programs or entrepreneurial tracks where students are able to com-plete additional coursework that identify with entrepre- neurship in a pharmacy context. 8-11In March 2017, theCorresponding Author: Joey Mattingly, 20 N.

University of Maryland School of Pharmacy trademarked the term “pharmapreneurism” to describe the process by which pharmacy entrepreneurs achieve their career aspi- rations by addressing the nation’s health care, research, policy, and societal needs through leadership, and inno- vation.12 The efforts of many pharmacy organizations and ed- ucational institutions seem to reflect a desire to develop an entrepreneurial ecosystem, ie, an environment that sup- ports the development and growth of new ventures through social, political, economic, and cultural elements, for the profession of pharmacy.13,14While the importance of entrepreneurism in pharmacy has been stressed, an appropriate role for innovation and entrepreneurship within pharmacy practice and education, along with anagreed upon set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) for a pharmacist entrepreneur, have not been identiﬁed. The objective of this review was to identify and describe the role of entrepreneurship within phar- macy practice, the role schools and colleges of pharmacy play in developing pharmacist entrepreneurs, and the KSAs that should be incorporated in a pharmacist entre- preneur construct. METHODS A literature review was conducted using the SCOPUS, EMBASE, and PubMed databases in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.15The following search strategy was used: [ALL (entrepren*) OR ALL (capitalis*) OR ALL (“academic capitalism”) AND ALL (“college of pharmacy”) OR ALL (“pharmacy school”) OR ALL (“pharmacy education”)]. No date restrictions or study types were imposed on the database searches. After removal of duplicates, two reviewers participatedin screening all abstracts independently for relevance to pharmacy education and entrepreneurship. An apriori screening discrepancy threshold between the independent reviewers was set at 20% to indicate the need for a full second screening. All discrepancies were discussed until
set at 20% to indicate the need for a full second screening. All discrepancies were discussed until consensus for inclusion for full-text review was reached. Full-text articles were retrieved and further assessed for eligibility based on the relevance of the study objectives to identify the role of entrepreneurship in practice, educa- tion, and mention of potential KSAs of entrepreneurs. Data extraction and synthesis included citation de- tails (authors, article title, journal title, year published), study type, the roles of entrepreneurism in pharmacy and pharmacy education, and the KSAs of an entrepreneur that were identified. A narrative review of study types, roles, and KSAs was conducted to identify themes based on frequencies (number of sources found) for each.RESULTS In the initial search, 483 articles were identified. Af- ter removal of duplicates, 404 unique abstracts were iden- tified for screening. The independent reviewer abstractscreening process resulted in a 91% initial agreement on which abstracts to include in the study. The two reviewers then discussed points of disagreement until full agree- ment was reached. After the application of inclusion criteria during the abstract screening and full-text assess- ment of eligibility stages, 27 articles were included for analysis (Figure 1). 4,6,24-33,16,34-40,17-23 The types of papers included in the study were sur- veys (10 [37.0%]), instructional design manuscripts (6 [22.2%]), commentaries (5 [18.5%], qualitative inter- views (4 [14.8%]), and committee reports (2 [7.4%].Years of publication ranged from 1999 to 2017, with 20 (74.1%) of the 27 articles published in a pharmacy- specific, peer-reviewed journal. The most frequent roles for entrepreneurship in both pharmacy practice and pharmacy education are described in Table 1. In terms of pharmacy practice, entrepreneur- ship was most frequently associated with innovation and creativity to develop new opportunities for pharmacists. Subsequently, the most

Additional roles identiﬁed in t h el i t e r a t u r ef o re n t r e p r e - neurship in pharmacy practice included service devel- opment, problem-solving, beneﬁting society, service promotion, risk-taking, proa ctivity, service implemen- tation, job satisfaction, and e valuating sustainability. Additional roles for entrepreneurship in pharmacy education include application, business management, emphasizing proactivity, problem-solving, no role iden- tiﬁed, cultivation, teaching ve rsatility, better communi- cation, self-reﬂection, identiﬁcation, ownership training, and continuing education. Table 2 summarizes and describes the most fre- quent entrepreneurial KSAs identiﬁed. Risk-taking and creativity/innovation were the most frequently identiﬁed with 17 (63.0%) different manuscripts mentioning these as important KSAs for a pharmacist entrepreneur. Other KSAs themes identiﬁed include self-starter, management, proactivity, communication, strategic planning, positiv-ity, decision-making, teamwork, versatility, marketing, critical thinking, competitiveness, proposal development, numeracy, technology, self-reﬂection, persistence, social responsibility, and cultural competence. DISCUSSION The concept of entrepreneurship in pharmacy educa- tion in the literature general ly reflects that in the broaderAmerican Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 2019; 83 (3) Article 7233. 274
business literature in the sense that entrepreneurs seek to innovate and create opportunities amid an environment of uncertainty.2,13Lupkin and Dess describe the act of launching a new venture as essential to entrepreneurship, including entering a new or existing market with new or existing goods or services.41Research involving the appli- cation of entrepreneurial orientation theory in the context of advancing pharmacy practice appeared between 1999 and 2012, with ﬁve different studies by a similar set of authors. Aside from that, however, there has been little consistency in the methodological approach to understand- ing entrepreneurship in pharmacy.30,33,35,36,40-42Articles addressing entrepreneurship in pharmacy predominantly focus on the development and implementation of an in-novative service without specifying a ﬁnal outcome of the new venture. The recommended outcome identiﬁed by CAPE, “engaging in innovative activities by using creating thinking to envision better ways of accomplishing profes- sional goals,” may be limited in that it fails to evaluate whether pharmacy-led entrepreneurship education actu- ally increases new pharmacist-led ventures. 4 Strategy and Decision-Making Strategic planning4,6,18,25,27,28,32,39and decision- making4,6,18,24,25,27,31appeared frequently as key areas for pharmacist entrepreneurs. The ﬁeld of strategicmanagement frequently overlaps with entrepreneurship, revolving around assessing and evaluating market oppor- tunities.41Shahiwala describes the use of a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to help students determine the feasibility of a new phar- macy business.18The SWOT analysis is widely used and provides a simple framework to get new students engaged in business planning. In terms of decision- making, most articles refer to establishing priorities and allocating resources effectively. Strategic planning was typically a component of decision-making in the studies we reviewed, but none of the
planning was typically a component of decision-making in the studies we reviewed, but none of the studies directly assessed whether effective strategic planning improved decision- making for the pharmacist entrepreneur. This may be apotential area for instructional design, ie, to test whether students exposed to more robust strategy education achieved better outcomes, or in lay terms, made the right business decision. Critical Thinking Critical-thinking or problem-solving skills were cited frequently as components of pharmacy entrepre- neurship. 6,16,24,26,27Multiple validated critical-thinking instruments have been studied in pharmacy education.These articles describe the implementation process and study design challenges, which varied depending on Figure 1. Flow Diagram in Accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses: The PRISMA Statement15American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 2019; 83 (3) Article 7233. 275
whether the assessment tool was developed for use with undergraduates or speciﬁc to health care practice.43,44 Educational activities aimed at improving broad criti- cal-thinking skills may indirectly beneﬁt the developmentof future pharmacy entrepreneurs, but no direct link has been demonstrated between pharmacy students’ perfor-mance on critical thinking assessments and long-term en- trepreneurial outcomes.Table 1.

Core Business Management The pharmacy education literature puts a greater em- phasis on KSAs typically identified with traditional man- agement roles (operations, workflow, human resources management, accounting, resource management, etc) than do other entrepreneurial frameworks.* Expandingbusiness management education for pharmacists may have many indirect beneﬁts pertaining to previously iden- tiﬁed entrepreneurial competency clusters. 7For example, greater understanding of ﬁnancial statements may allow for better communication with a hired accountant or im- prove student conﬁdence when evaluating ﬁnancial decisions. Whether meeting traditional business manage- ment competencies improves pharmacy students’ will- ingness or ability to start new business ventures remainsto be seen. Many schools allow students to pursue the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) and masters of business administration (MBA) degrees concurrently. Future in- vestigations may want to consider how the combination PharmD/MBA inﬂuences entrepreneurial activities. An Entrepreneurial Attitude Multiple articles referred to entrepreneurship con- structs as reflecting an attitude or orientation rather than a knowledge base or skill. The pharmacist entrepreneur could be summarized as a proactive, confident self-starterwith a positive disposition who is willing to take risks and compete. An entrepreneur’s attitude towards uncertainty seems to be a deﬁning feature in many of the articles in- cluded in this review. Cain describes risk aversion as a barrier to creativity and employs methods that challenge students to take “intellectual risks” that encourage crea- tive thinking. 19Conﬁdence was a reoccurring attitude in the pharmacy entrepreneurship literature, which coin- cides with entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy research that ar-gues conﬁdence as a distinguishing feature between entrepreneurs and managers. 46Additionally, domains within the Lumpkin and Dess model of entrepreneurial orientation (risk-taking,
domains within the Lumpkin and Dess model of entrepreneurial orientation (risk-taking, innovativeness, proactiveness, autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness) were used in multiple pharmacy-speciﬁc surveys, demonstrating a potential framework that could be further developed for application to pharmacy education.30,35,36,40,41 Application to the Real World The use of active-learning or problem-based approaches to teach pharmacist entrepreneurship in a real-world setting was frequently identified in the articles we reviewed as an important instructional method.4,16,18,24–27,34This sup- ports the subjectivist theory of entrepreneurship, whichsuggests one’s experience in business settings is fundamen- tally important to the process of discovery and creativity.47 However, the extent to which active learning while in phar-macy school can replace real-world entrepreneurial expe- rience may determine the overall pedagogical efﬁcacy of the construct. Recommendations for ACPE Standards The 2013 CAPE Outcomes served as the framework for the 2016 Standards published for pharmacy school ac- creditation. Many of the most frequently cited KSAs are incorporated directly and indirectly within the ACPE Stan- dards and Guidance documents, suggesting that many schools may already be at least partially preparing graduates to become pharmacist entrepreneurs. 4,5,48The KSAs that do not clearly map to existing ACPE Standards are risk-taking, strategic planning, m arketing, competitiveness, and social responsibility. As the Association considers updates to the Standards, engaging successful entrepreneurs and experts in entrepreneurial education in the development process could help identify ways to incorporate the most important components previously identiﬁed for pharmacist entrepre- neurs. Additionally, drafting policy that deﬁnes the role of entrepreneurial education in schools and colleges of phar- m a c yc o u l dl e a dt oaf o r m a lA s s o c i a t i o ns t a n c eo ni t sp l a c e
of phar- m a c yc o u l dl e a dt oaf o r m a lA s s o c i a t i o ns t a n c eo ni t sp l a c e in accreditation standards. While many pharmacist entrepreneur KSAs may be mapped to the standards, several were intended to solve therapeutic problems or prioritize a specific patient’s needs (eg critical thinking, de cision-making, technol- ogy, communication) and may not be completely trans- ferable to the construct of a pharmacist entrepreneur. For example, the process of communicating a medication action plan effectively to an interprofessional health team may not fully capture the communication skillsidentiﬁed in the literature as necessary for pharmacist entrepreneurs. Additiona lly, some KSAs identiﬁed in this review may be included in other courses built to address the affective domain. The CAPE suggested var- ious learning objective examples throughout the “Per- sonal and Professional Development” domain that could address some of the entrepreneurship KSAs. 4For exam- ple, displaying conﬁdence and positive self-esteem may serve to advance a pharmacist’s professional develop- ment while also advancing one’s ability to exhibit the “Positivity” domain of entrepreneurship. While educa-tors can reasonably assume that some of the clinical KSAs overlap, additional research in this area would validate the true gaps. This review included commentaries, instructional design manuscripts, and organizational committee reports, which often place more weight on opinion or testimony *References 6,21,45,23,24,26,27,29,32,37,39American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 2019; 83 (3) Article 7233. 277
than do original research submissions. Peer-reviewed opin- ions, committee recommendations, and faculty descrip- tions of new courses could add value to the stated objectives of this review despite the limitation in meth- odological rigor. Frequencies for roles and KSAs were assessed by number of manuscripts, with no qualitativerating given to them other than that potentially implied by the study type. Attempting to add subjective ratings to these types of studies may have introduced different biases, so we decided to focus on the mere mentioning of the role or KSA. The search terms used in the literature search did not include “innovation” or similar terms be- cause including such terms within the current search strat- egy would have retrieved articles on drug innovation and innovations in pharmacy education that were not speciﬁc toentrepreneurship and increased the number of potential articles to 5,917.CONCLUSION A wide range of roles for entrepreneurship in phar- macy practice or education were identified. A list of KSAs from the pharmacy education literature relatedto entrepreneurship was developed to assist with estab- lishing a “pharmacist entrepr eneur” construct. Further research into the agreement with the KSAs and potential instructional design and assessment strategies is needed to help guide faculty member s interested in incorporat- ing entrepreneurship education in schools or colleges of pharmacy.

REVIEW A Systematic Review of Entrepreneurship in Pharmacy Practice and Education T. Joseph Mattingly II, PharmD, MBA,a,bC. Daniel Mullins, PhD,aDiamond R. Melendez,a Kenneth Boyden, JD, EdD,aNatalie D. Eddington, PhDa aUniversity of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, Maryland bEditorial Board Member, American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education , Arlington, Virginia Submitted June 22, 2018; accepted August 20, 2018; published April 2019. Objective. To review literature pertaining to entrepreneurship in pharmacy practice, education, and the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) identiﬁed for pharmacist entrepreneurs. Findings. In terms of pharmacy practice, entrepreneurship was most frequently identiﬁed with innova- tion and creativity to develop new opportunities for pharmacists. The most frequent role for entrepreneur- ship in pharmacy education was related to schools putting a greater emphasis on innovation, creativity, or divergent thinking. Risk-taking and creativity/innovation were the most frequently identiﬁed KSAs, with 17 (63.0%) manuscripts mentioning these as important for a pharmacist entrepreneur. Other KSAs pertaining to pharmacy entrepreneurship that were mentioned in the articles included self-starter,management, proactivity, communication, strategic planning, positivity, decision-making, teamwork, versatility, marketing, critical thinking, competitiveness, proposal development, numeracy, technology, self-reﬂection, persistence, social responsibility, and cultural competence. Summary. No consensus for entrepreneurship in pharmacy practice or education currently exists. In order to improve instructional design and assessment for pharmacy entrepreneurship education, a core set of KSAs for a pharmacist entrepreneur construct must be identiﬁed. The most commonly cited KSAs in related literature that are not already part of the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education standards include risk-taking, strategic planning, marketing,
Council for Pharmacy Education standards include risk-taking, strategic planning, marketing, competitiveness, and social responsibility. These may serve as a starting point for enhancing pharmacy curricula to embrace pharmacist entrepreneurship. Keywords: entrepreneur, knowledge, skills, attitudes INTRODUCTION Entrepreneurial outcomes in education refer to new venture development, business start-ups, and job creation contributing to economic growth and development.1 More broadly, entrepreneurship can be deﬁned as identi-fying or creating new opportunities within uncertain en-vironments. 2Business school experts have debated about whether entrepreneurship should be considered a con- struct for the classroom, or whether real-world experience is more appropriate as a delivery method for this type of education.2,3 Within pharmacy education, entrepreneurship has been identified as a key factor driving innovation in phar- macy practice. To guide the Academy in this area, the Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education(CAPE) included entrepreneurship within domains in 2013. This action influenced the Accreditation Councilfor Pharmacy Education (ACPE) to include entrepreneur- ship within the standards used to evaluate professional pharmacy programs in 2016. 4,5The 2010-2011 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) Academic Affairs Standing Committee identiﬁed entrepreneurshipas an affective domain trait, thereby enabling students to develop sustainable practice models. 6The Committee suggested using Rubino and Freshman’s entrepreneur- ship competency clusters (decision making, strategic thinking, risk taking, conﬁdence building, communicat- ing ideas, motivating team members, tolerance of ambi- guity, and internal locus of control) as a potential framework for developing a pharmacy entrepreneur.6,7 Many schools have developed educational programs toaddress entrepreneurship in pharmacy.

entrepreneurship in pharmacy. In addition to the lectures taught in traditional pharmacy management courses, multiple schools now offer certiﬁcate programs or entrepreneurial tracks where students are able to com-plete additional coursework that identify with entrepre- neurship in a pharmacy context. 8-11In March 2017, theCorresponding Author: Joey Mattingly, 20 N.

University of Maryland School of Pharmacy trademarked the term “pharmapreneurism” to describe the process by which pharmacy entrepreneurs achieve their career aspi- rations by addressing the nation’s health care, research, policy, and societal needs through leadership, and inno- vation.12 The efforts of many pharmacy organizations and ed- ucational institutions seem to reflect a desire to develop an entrepreneurial ecosystem, ie, an environment that sup- ports the development and growth of new ventures through social, political, economic, and cultural elements, for the profession of pharmacy.13,14While the importance of entrepreneurism in pharmacy has been stressed, an appropriate role for innovation and entrepreneurship within pharmacy practice and education, along with anagreed upon set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) for a pharmacist entrepreneur, have not been identiﬁed. The objective of this review was to identify and describe the role of entrepreneurship within phar- macy practice, the role schools and colleges of pharmacy play in developing pharmacist entrepreneurs, and the KSAs that should be incorporated in a pharmacist entre- preneur construct. METHODS A literature review was conducted using the SCOPUS, EMBASE, and PubMed databases in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.15The following search strategy was used: [ALL (entrepren*) OR ALL (capitalis*) OR ALL (“academic capitalism”) AND ALL (“college of pharmacy”) OR ALL (“pharmacy school”) OR ALL (“pharmacy education”)]. No date restrictions or study types were imposed on the database searches. After removal of duplicates, two reviewers participatedin screening all abstracts independently for relevance to pharmacy education and entrepreneurship. An apriori screening discrepancy threshold between the independent reviewers was set at 20% to indicate the need for a full second screening. All discrepancies were discussed until
set at 20% to indicate the need for a full second screening. All discrepancies were discussed until consensus for inclusion for full-text review was reached. Full-text articles were retrieved and further assessed for eligibility based on the relevance of the study objectives to identify the role of entrepreneurship in practice, educa- tion, and mention of potential KSAs of entrepreneurs. Data extraction and synthesis included citation de- tails (authors, article title, journal title, year published), study type, the roles of entrepreneurism in pharmacy and pharmacy education, and the KSAs of an entrepreneur that were identified. A narrative review of study types, roles, and KSAs was conducted to identify themes based on frequencies (number of sources found) for each.RESULTS In the initial search, 483 articles were identified. Af- ter removal of duplicates, 404 unique abstracts were iden- tified for screening. The independent reviewer abstractscreening process resulted in a 91% initial agreement on which abstracts to include in the study. The two reviewers then discussed points of disagreement until full agree- ment was reached. After the application of inclusion criteria during the abstract screening and full-text assess- ment of eligibility stages, 27 articles were included for analysis (Figure 1). 4,6,24-33,16,34-40,17-23 The types of papers included in the study were sur- veys (10 [37.0%]), instructional design manuscripts (6 [22.2%]), commentaries (5 [18.5%], qualitative inter- views (4 [14.8%]), and committee reports (2 [7.4%].Years of publication ranged from 1999 to 2017, with 20 (74.1%) of the 27 articles published in a pharmacy- specific, peer-reviewed journal. The most frequent roles for entrepreneurship in both pharmacy practice and pharmacy education are described in Table 1. In terms of pharmacy practice, entrepreneur- ship was most frequently associated with innovation and creativity to develop new opportunities for pharmacists. Subsequently, the most

Additional roles identiﬁed in t h el i t e r a t u r ef o re n t r e p r e - neurship in pharmacy practice included service devel- opment, problem-solving, beneﬁting society, service promotion, risk-taking, proa ctivity, service implemen- tation, job satisfaction, and e valuating sustainability. Additional roles for entrepreneurship in pharmacy education include application, business management, emphasizing proactivity, problem-solving, no role iden- tiﬁed, cultivation, teaching ve rsatility, better communi- cation, self-reﬂection, identiﬁcation, ownership training, and continuing education. Table 2 summarizes and describes the most fre- quent entrepreneurial KSAs identiﬁed. Risk-taking and creativity/innovation were the most frequently identiﬁed with 17 (63.0%) different manuscripts mentioning these as important KSAs for a pharmacist entrepreneur. Other KSAs themes identiﬁed include self-starter, management, proactivity, communication, strategic planning, positiv-ity, decision-making, teamwork, versatility, marketing, critical thinking, competitiveness, proposal development, numeracy, technology, self-reﬂection, persistence, social responsibility, and cultural competence. DISCUSSION The concept of entrepreneurship in pharmacy educa- tion in the literature general ly reflects that in the broaderAmerican Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 2019; 83 (3) Article 7233. 274
business literature in the sense that entrepreneurs seek to innovate and create opportunities amid an environment of uncertainty.2,13Lupkin and Dess describe the act of launching a new venture as essential to entrepreneurship, including entering a new or existing market with new or existing goods or services.41Research involving the appli- cation of entrepreneurial orientation theory in the context of advancing pharmacy practice appeared between 1999 and 2012, with ﬁve different studies by a similar set of authors. Aside from that, however, there has been little consistency in the methodological approach to understand- ing entrepreneurship in pharmacy.30,33,35,36,40-42Articles addressing entrepreneurship in pharmacy predominantly focus on the development and implementation of an in-novative service without specifying a ﬁnal outcome of the new venture. The recommended outcome identiﬁed by CAPE, “engaging in innovative activities by using creating thinking to envision better ways of accomplishing profes- sional goals,” may be limited in that it fails to evaluate whether pharmacy-led entrepreneurship education actu- ally increases new pharmacist-led ventures. 4 Strategy and Decision-Making Strategic planning4,6,18,25,27,28,32,39and decision- making4,6,18,24,25,27,31appeared frequently as key areas for pharmacist entrepreneurs. The ﬁeld of strategicmanagement frequently overlaps with entrepreneurship, revolving around assessing and evaluating market oppor- tunities.41Shahiwala describes the use of a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to help students determine the feasibility of a new phar- macy business.18The SWOT analysis is widely used and provides a simple framework to get new students engaged in business planning. In terms of decision- making, most articles refer to establishing priorities and allocating resources effectively. Strategic planning was typically a component of decision-making in the studies we reviewed, but none of the
planning was typically a component of decision-making in the studies we reviewed, but none of the studies directly assessed whether effective strategic planning improved decision- making for the pharmacist entrepreneur. This may be apotential area for instructional design, ie, to test whether students exposed to more robust strategy education achieved better outcomes, or in lay terms, made the right business decision. Critical Thinking Critical-thinking or problem-solving skills were cited frequently as components of pharmacy entrepre- neurship. 6,16,24,26,27Multiple validated critical-thinking instruments have been studied in pharmacy education.These articles describe the implementation process and study design challenges, which varied depending on Figure 1. Flow Diagram in Accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses: The PRISMA Statement15American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 2019; 83 (3) Article 7233. 275
whether the assessment tool was developed for use with undergraduates or speciﬁc to health care practice.43,44 Educational activities aimed at improving broad criti- cal-thinking skills may indirectly beneﬁt the developmentof future pharmacy entrepreneurs, but no direct link has been demonstrated between pharmacy students’ perfor-mance on critical thinking assessments and long-term en- trepreneurial outcomes.Table 1.

Core Business Management The pharmacy education literature puts a greater em- phasis on KSAs typically identified with traditional man- agement roles (operations, workflow, human resources management, accounting, resource management, etc) than do other entrepreneurial frameworks.* Expandingbusiness management education for pharmacists may have many indirect beneﬁts pertaining to previously iden- tiﬁed entrepreneurial competency clusters. 7For example, greater understanding of ﬁnancial statements may allow for better communication with a hired accountant or im- prove student conﬁdence when evaluating ﬁnancial decisions. Whether meeting traditional business manage- ment competencies improves pharmacy students’ will- ingness or ability to start new business ventures remainsto be seen. Many schools allow students to pursue the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) and masters of business administration (MBA) degrees concurrently. Future in- vestigations may want to consider how the combination PharmD/MBA inﬂuences entrepreneurial activities. An Entrepreneurial Attitude Multiple articles referred to entrepreneurship con- structs as reflecting an attitude or orientation rather than a knowledge base or skill. The pharmacist entrepreneur could be summarized as a proactive, confident self-starterwith a positive disposition who is willing to take risks and compete. An entrepreneur’s attitude towards uncertainty seems to be a deﬁning feature in many of the articles in- cluded in this review. Cain describes risk aversion as a barrier to creativity and employs methods that challenge students to take “intellectual risks” that encourage crea- tive thinking. 19Conﬁdence was a reoccurring attitude in the pharmacy entrepreneurship literature, which coin- cides with entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy research that ar-gues conﬁdence as a distinguishing feature between entrepreneurs and managers. 46Additionally, domains within the Lumpkin and Dess model of entrepreneurial orientation (risk-taking,
domains within the Lumpkin and Dess model of entrepreneurial orientation (risk-taking, innovativeness, proactiveness, autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness) were used in multiple pharmacy-speciﬁc surveys, demonstrating a potential framework that could be further developed for application to pharmacy education.30,35,36,40,41 Application to the Real World The use of active-learning or problem-based approaches to teach pharmacist entrepreneurship in a real-world setting was frequently identified in the articles we reviewed as an important instructional method.4,16,18,24–27,34This sup- ports the subjectivist theory of entrepreneurship, whichsuggests one’s experience in business settings is fundamen- tally important to the process of discovery and creativity.47 However, the extent to which active learning while in phar-macy school can replace real-world entrepreneurial expe- rience may determine the overall pedagogical efﬁcacy of the construct. Recommendations for ACPE Standards The 2013 CAPE Outcomes served as the framework for the 2016 Standards published for pharmacy school ac- creditation. Many of the most frequently cited KSAs are incorporated directly and indirectly within the ACPE Stan- dards and Guidance documents, suggesting that many schools may already be at least partially preparing graduates to become pharmacist entrepreneurs. 4,5,48The KSAs that do not clearly map to existing ACPE Standards are risk-taking, strategic planning, m arketing, competitiveness, and social responsibility. As the Association considers updates to the Standards, engaging successful entrepreneurs and experts in entrepreneurial education in the development process could help identify ways to incorporate the most important components previously identiﬁed for pharmacist entrepre- neurs. Additionally, drafting policy that deﬁnes the role of entrepreneurial education in schools and colleges of phar- m a c yc o u l dl e a dt oaf o r m a lA s s o c i a t i o ns t a n c eo ni t sp l a c e --- of phar- m a c yc o u l dl e a dt oaf o r m a lA s s o c i a t i o ns t a n c eo ni t sp l a c e in accreditation standards. While many pharmacist entrepreneur KSAs may be mapped to the standards, several were intended to solve therapeutic problems or prioritize a specific patient’s needs (eg critical thinking, de cision-making, technol- ogy, communication) and may not be completely trans- ferable to the construct of a pharmacist entrepreneur. For example, the process of communicating a medication action plan effectively to an interprofessional health team may not fully capture the communication skillsidentiﬁed in the literature as necessary for pharmacist entrepreneurs. Additiona lly, some KSAs identiﬁed in this review may be included in other courses built to address the affective domain. The CAPE suggested var- ious learning objective examples throughout the “Per- sonal and Professional Development” domain that could address some of the entrepreneurship KSAs. 4For exam- ple, displaying conﬁdence and positive self-esteem may serve to advance a pharmacist’s professional develop- ment while also advancing one’s ability to exhibit the “Positivity” domain of entrepreneurship. While educa-tors can reasonably assume that some of the clinical KSAs overlap, additional research in this area would validate the true gaps. This review included commentaries, instructional design manuscripts, and organizational committee reports, which often place more weight on opinion or testimony *References 6,21,45,23,24,26,27,29,32,37,39American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education 2019; 83 (3) Article 7233. 277
than do original research submissions. Peer-reviewed opin- ions, committee recommendations, and faculty descrip- tions of new courses could add value to the stated objectives of this review despite the limitation in meth- odological rigor. Frequencies for roles and KSAs were assessed by number of manuscripts, with no qualitativerating given to them other than that potentially implied by the study type. Attempting to add subjective ratings to these types of studies may have introduced different biases, so we decided to focus on the mere mentioning of the role or KSA. The search terms used in the literature search did not include “innovation” or similar terms be- cause including such terms within the current search strat- egy would have retrieved articles on drug innovation and innovations in pharmacy education that were not speciﬁc toentrepreneurship and increased the number of potential articles to 5,917.CONCLUSION A wide range of roles for entrepreneurship in phar- macy practice or education were identified. A list of KSAs from the pharmacy education literature relatedto entrepreneurship was developed to assist with estab- lishing a “pharmacist entrepr eneur” construct. Further research into the agreement with the KSAs and potential instructional design and assessment strategies is needed to help guide faculty member s interested in incorporat- ing entrepreneurship education in schools or colleges of pharmacy.

En el estudio realizado por T. Joseph Mattingly II, PharmD, MBA, C. Daniel Mullins, PhD, Diamond R. Melendez, Kenneth Boyden, JD, EdD, y Natalie D. Eddington, PhD de la Facultad de Farmacia de la Universidad de Maryland, se exploró el emprendimiento en la práctica y educación farmacéutica, así como las habilidades, conocimientos y actitudes (KSAs) necesarias para los farmacéuticos emprendedores.

En cuanto a la práctica farmacéutica, el emprendimiento se asoció comúnmente con la innovación y la creatividad para crear nuevas oportunidades para los farmacéuticos. En la educación farmacéutica, el emprendimiento se relacionó con escuelas que enfatizan la innovación, la creatividad y el pensamiento divergente. Las KSAs más identificadas para los farmacéuticos emprendedores fueron la toma de riesgos y la creatividad/innovación, con un 63.0% de los manuscritos revisados mencionándolos como cruciales. Otras KSAs mencionadas incluyeron ser autónomo, habilidades de gestión, proactividad, comunicación, planificación estratégica, positividad, toma de decisiones, trabajo en equipo, versatilidad, marketing, pensamiento crítico, competitividad, desarrollo de propuestas, habilidades numéricas, tecnología, autorreflexión, persistencia, responsabilidad social y competencia cultural.

El estudio resaltó la falta de consenso sobre el emprendimiento en la práctica y educación farmacéutica. Para mejorar el diseño y la evaluación instruccional para la educación en emprendimiento farmacéutico, es necesario identificar un conjunto central de KSAs para los farmacéuticos emprendedores. Algunas de las KSAs más citadas en la literatura, como la toma de riesgos, la planificación estratégica y el marketing, no forman parte actualmente de los estándares del Consejo de Acreditación para la Educación en Farmacia. Se necesita más investigación y colaboración para establecer un marco estandarizado para el emprendimiento en la práctica y educación farmacéutica.

El texto destaca la importancia de incorporar el emprendimiento en la educación farmacéutica para impulsar la innovación en la práctica farmacéutica. Los estándares del Consejo de Acreditación para la Educación en Farmacia incluyen la toma de riesgos, la planificación estratégica, el marketing, la competitividad y la responsabilidad social como elementos clave para mejorar los planes de estudio de farmacia y abrazar el emprendimiento farmacéutico. Los resultados empresariales en la educación se refieren al desarrollo de nuevas empresas, inicio de negocios y creación de empleo que contribuyen al crecimiento económico y al desarrollo. El emprendimiento se define como identificar o crear nuevas oportunidades dentro de entornos inciertos.

Expertos en escuelas de negocios han debatido si el emprendimiento debe enseñarse en el aula o a través de experiencias del mundo real. En la educación farmacéutica, el emprendimiento se ha reconocido como un factor clave para impulsar la innovación. El Centro para el Avance de la Educación en Farmacia (CAPE) incluyó el emprendimiento dentro de los dominios en 2013, lo que influyó en el Consejo de Acreditación para la Educación en Farmacia (ACPE) para incluir el emprendimiento dentro de los estándares utilizados para evaluar los programas profesionales de farmacia en 2016.

El Comité de Asuntos Académicos de la Asociación Estadounidense de Facultades de Farmacia (AACP) identificó el emprendimiento como un rasgo del dominio afectivo en 2010-2011, lo que permite a los estudiantes desarrollar modelos de práctica sostenibles. El Comité sugirió utilizar los grupos de competencias empresariales de Rubino y Freshman, como la toma de decisiones, el pensamiento estratégico, la toma de riesgos, la construcción de confianza, la comunicación de ideas, la motivación de los miembros del equipo, la tolerancia a la ambigüedad y el locus de control interno, como un marco potencial para desarrollar un farmacéutico emprendedor.

Muchas escuelas han desarrollado programas educativos para abordar el emprendimiento en farmacia, incluyendo conferencias sobre gestión farmacéutica. En general, se considera esencial incorporar el emprendimiento en la educación farmacéutica para impulsar la innovación y preparar a los estudiantes para carreras exitosas en el campo.
