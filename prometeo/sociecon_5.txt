While LSAs are gaining momentum in the ecosystem surrounding digital startups, they still su ﬀer from poor theoretical foundations and operational issues that hinder their adoption and implementation. The aim of this study is to go beyond recalling anecdotal and single-case examples and, throughmixed-methods research involving 227 digital startups, provide a ﬁrst large-scale analysis of: (i) if and how digital startups apply Lean Startups Approaches; (ii) the ensuing results; (iii) the main advantages and dis-advantages that stem from adopting and implementing LSAs; and (iv) how digital startups connect and combinethe LSAs with other entrepreneurial approaches and tools for launching startups. The ﬁndings reveal that most of the sample has adopted LSAs and obtained several bene ﬁts from their use. A list of practical guidelines on how to solve the existing drawbacks and enhance the eﬀ ectiveness of adopting and implementing LSAs is hence pro- posed. To conclude, a framework for organizing the empirical ﬁndings is put forward, where LSAs are inserted into the entrepreneurship theory debate on E ﬀectuation, Entrepreneurial
where LSAs are inserted into the entrepreneurship theory debate on E ﬀectuation, Entrepreneurial Bricolage and Opportunity Creation. Suggestions are then provided on how to sequence and bridge eﬀ ectuation and causation logics and decision- making tools in an “entrepreneurial opportunities space” . 1. Introduction “There are three principal means of acquiring knowledge …observation of nature, re ﬂection, and experimentation. Observation collects facts; reﬂection combines them; experimentation veri ﬁes the result of that combination ”. (Denis Diderot, 1753 ) 1.1. Reasoning behind the study Entrepreneurial endeavours carry with them an abundance of ac- tivities that entrepreneurs must perform in order to acquire tangible and intangible resources ( Barney, 1991, 2001) and transform them into new ventures or startups. As the French philosopher Denis Diderot (1966) wrote, there are three principle means of acquiring knowledge available to us: observation of nature, re ﬂection and experimentation. These mirror what is also required from entrepreneurs, as they need to observe their surroundings closely when trying to identify potential opportunities ( Shane and Venkataraman, 2000 ). Once an opportunity has been detected, these entrepreneurs must think hard about how tocombine their resources creatively and originally ( Ireland et al., 2003 ) so that they become heterogeneous –i.e. they create value for custo- mers, yet are rare and costly to imitate ( Barney, 2001 )–and on how to mould a value proposition and a startup around this unique pattern of resources. After this, entrepreneurs must test their design ( Kerr et al., 2014 ) to see whether their startup is likely to create, deliver and cap- ture value is a way that will be accepted by their target customers and, therefore, be viable. This ﬁnal action is needed to validate the overall startup business model, in other words, its architecture of value ( Ghezzi et al., 2015 ;Rappa, 2001; Teece, 2010 ). This part is
words, its architecture of value ( Ghezzi et al., 2015 ;Rappa, 2001; Teece, 2010 ). This part is particularly complex within the highly volatile context of digital entrepreneurship ( Autio et al., 2018 ;Nambisan, 2017 ), where opportunities are quick to arise and vanish, combined resources un- expectedly acquire or lose their original value, and testing becomes a vital feature of the startup's learning process ( Contigiani and Levinthal, 2018 ). Digital startups launching their products and services in this setting can use a recent and emerging set of practices to test out and validatetheir business model, known as Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs), which consist of Customer Development ( Blank, 2007; Blank and Dorf, 2012 ) and the Lean Startup ( Ries, 2011). These pragmatic methods for https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2018.09.017 Received 11 December 2017; Received in revised form 1 August 2018; Accepted 18 September 2018E-mail address: antonio1.ghezzi@polimi.it .Technological Forecasting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945–960 Available online 24 September 2018 0040-1625/ © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

transferring the notions of Lean Manufacturing ( Womack and Jones, 1996 ) to the startups' environment are built upon a set of key principles: (i) formulating falsi ﬁable hypotheses about the business idea; (ii) em- bedding these hypotheses into a designed business model (BM); (iii) developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to replicate the product's functions and test the business model; (iv) identifying the target audi- ence or “earlyvangelists ”from whom to receive feedback; and (v) running tests with multiple iterations to make decisions about perse-vering with the business idea, letting it perish or pivoting, that is, un- dertaking a structured course of correction (according to the “build- measure-learn ”feedback loop). Although these approaches are gaining momentum within the startup community ( Breuer, 2013; Kerr et al., 2014; Kiura et al., 2014; Frederiksen and Brem, 2017 ), and sometimes are even penetrating the corporate world as they are adopted by incumbents ( Power, 2014; Ries and Euchner, 2013 ), they still lack the necessary theoretical founda- tions ( Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2018; Yang et al., 2018 ), with speci ﬁc re- ference to the extant theories on Entrepreneurship. Moreover, as the largely practitioner-oriented literature on LSAs builds on recalling past cases and anecdotal evidence, little is known concerning: (i) the actual adoption and e ﬀectiveness of these approaches in terms of assisting in the digital startups' launch; (ii) their connection to other traditionalentrepreneurial tools such as business plans; and (iii) their inclusion within more established entrepreneurial theories and logics. 1.2. Purpose and research questions This study hence sets forth as its objective to go beyond recalling anecdotal and single-case examples and o ﬀers aﬁrst large-scale analysis of four aspects. These are: if and how digital startups apply Lean Startups Approaches (Research Question 1); the ensuing results(Research Question 2); the main advantages and
Approaches (Research Question 1); the ensuing results(Research Question 2); the main advantages and disadvantages they feel come from the adoption and implementation of LSAs (Research Question 3); and how digital startups connect and combine the LSAs with other entrepreneurial approaches and tools for launching startups (Research Question 4). Using a mixed methods approach, the study builds on the results of a survey on 227 digital startups launched between 2012 and 2017 contained in an original database; it further informs these results through a qualitative research method based on 32 semi-structured interviews, to disclose additional insights. 1.3. Contribution According to the study's ﬁndings, Lean Startup Approaches are largely adopted in the sample of digital startups investigated, and di- gital entrepreneurs gain signi ﬁcant bene ﬁts from their implementation, mostly referring to the following aspects: (i) reducing time and costs totest the startup; (iii) aligning business idea to customer needs; (iii) verifying and pivoting all business model parameters; (iv) receiving rounds of ﬁnancing; and (v) o ﬀering alternatives to traditional in- tellectual property protection. When setting up their digital startups,however, the entrepreneurs found that the work to implement LSAs was not as straightforward as they had expected, having often under- estimated the true complexity of putting in place the relative processes and tools. More speci ﬁcally, digital entrepreneurs claim that they en- counter issues concerning: (i) deﬁ ning and designing MVPs; (ii) iden- tifying and engaging earlyvangelists and trial users; (iii) de ﬁning  testing priorities and designing experiments and tests; (iv) missing othermarket opportunities and threats; and (v) obtaining information aboutthe startup's sources of competitive advantage. As a conclusion, this study suggests that LSAs could be positioned in the debate on entrepreneurship as an operational and scienti ﬁc ap- proach to the
be positioned in the debate on entrepreneurship as an operational and scienti ﬁc ap- proach to the behavioural theories of E ﬀectuation ( Sarasvathy, 2001 ) and Entrepreneurial Bricolage ( Baker and Nelson, 2005 ), within an Opportunity Creation setting ( Alvarez and Barney, 2007 ).These ﬁndings could help to properly address and amend the downsides of LSAs, encouraging digital startups to adopt this promising- but still scienti ﬁcally under-investigated - approach. 1.4. Structure This study is structured as follows. After this introduction ( Section 1),Section 2 contains the theoretical background in which the study is positioned (i.e. the discovery and creation theories of entrepreneurial opportunity and action, and Lean Startup Approaches); the study method is described in Section 3 , leading to the results given in Section 4. These results are discussed in Section 5, and the conclusions con- cerning the study's contribution are drawn in Section 6, together with its limitations and the avenues for future research. 2. Theoretical background2.1. Discovery and creation theories of entrepreneurial opportunity and action Entrepreneurship is commonly deﬁ ned as the act of discovering and pursuing pro ﬁtable opportunities ( Shane and Venkataraman, 2000); once such opportunities are spotted, the entrepreneur should move towards them, to build a new venture or startup around them. In this phase, entrepreneurs engage in “opportunity-seeking ”behaviour, sub- sequently followed by strategic or “advantage-seeking ”behaviour, in order to integrate the opportunity with competitive advantage ( Hitt et al., 2001 ;Ireland et al., 2003 ). While the literature shows consensus on the centrality of the con- cept of opportunity in entrepreneurship, di ﬀerent approaches emerge concerning the nature of these opportunities and the process throughwhich they become apparent. As Alvarez and Barney (2007) argue, two alternative theories of entrepreneurial action indicate that opportu-nities
(2007) argue, two alternative theories of entrepreneurial action indicate that opportu-nities can be discovered or created. According to the discovery theory of entrepreneurial opportunity (e.g. Shane and Venkataraman, 2000 ), opportunities exist in- dependently of the entrepreneurs, who should nurture alertness(Kirzner, 1973 ), that is, the ability to become aware of opportunities and discover them before others. A discovery view of opportunitieshence advocates the use of data collection and analysis techniques and methods framed in a business plan ( Delmar and Shane, 2003 ), to make decisions in a risky context. The creation theory of entrepreneurial opportunity takes a di ﬀerent stance (Gartner, 1985 ;Weick, 1979). Starting from the assumption that opportunities are not objective phenomena formed by exogenous shocks and that they do not exist independently of entrepreneurs, the creation theory posits that opportunities are social constructs en- dogenously created by the actions, reactions and enactment of the en- trepreneurs' exploring ways in order to create value in an uncertain context (Alvarez and Barney, pp. 13 –15). With regards to enactment, the proceedings entail an iterative, inductive and incremental decision-making process, supported by heuristics and based on the notion of aﬀordable loss rather than expected return. Diﬀerent entrepreneurial opportunity theories and decision-making contexts led to the advancement of parallel approaches and logics be- hind the entrepreneurial action. Sarasvathy (2001) restates this ap- parent dichotomy in her study comparing traditional causation logicswith what she calls “eﬀectuation ”. While causation sees the future as a continuation of the past, and entrepreneurial actions as goal-orientedundertakings that strive to avoid potential contingencies through ac-curate predictions and careful planning, E ﬀectuation considers the fu- ture as shaped by entrepreneurs, who act on the basis of the means athand –rather than
the fu- ture as shaped by entrepreneurs, who act on the basis of the means athand –rather than the goals –and plan for the unexpected, leveraging contingencies as they arise ( Yang et al., 2018 ). As in the case of Eﬀ ectuation logic, Entrepreneurial Bricolage ( Baker and Nelson, 2005 ) argues that entrepreneurs operate in a condition ofA.

extreme resource scarcity, and have, therefore, to “make do ”by com- bining the resources at hand and applying them to new problems and opportunities that arise. Making do hence implies making the most of limited resources, by engaging in experimentation, the early and fre- quent interaction with customers and subsequent iteration ( Fisher, 2012 ). Although the logics of Eﬀ ectuation and Entrepreneurial Bricolage can describe the actual behaviour of entrepreneurs involved in theprocess of creating and developing startups ( Fisher, 2012), little is still known concerning about how they can be placed in a systematic op-erational frame to enhance opportunity formation through the en- trepreneurs' enactment process. Although recent studies ( Frederiksen and Brem, 2017; Yang et al., 2018) have come up with the suggestion that Eﬀ ectuation could be put into practice through the Lean Startup (Ries, 2011 ), these contributions are still scattered and unconnected, and show either a largely conceptual stance, or some misconceptions about the di ﬀerent steps included in the Lean Startup and its precursor, Customer Development ( Blank, 2007). 2.2. Lean Startup Approaches The Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs), named originally by Ghezzi and Cavallo (2018) , include two main methods to develop startups, with enough similarities to couple them within the same framework: Customer Development ( Blank, 2007 ) and the Lean Startup ( Ries, 2011 ). Steve Blank (2007) was the pioneer of LSAs when he introduced the concept of “customer development ”and described the process that entrepreneurs should follow to test and re ﬁne their business hypotheses through customer interaction. In his seminal book “The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win ”, he argued that a startup is a temporary organization looking for a scalable andreplicable business model. Therefore, the primary aim of any startup should be to test whether the overarching hypotheses of its business
the primary aim of any startup should be to test whether the overarching hypotheses of its business model are indeed veri ﬁed, thus making the BM scalable and replicable. Based on Karl Popper's concepts of conjectures and refutations (Popper, 2014), which form the core of epistemology, the customer development approach states that, rather than developing products orservices, startups should develop customers and, to do so, they must go through a process consisting of two steps and four sub-steps (see Fig. 1 ). Theﬁrst is the “search ”step, when startups need to ﬁnd “ear- lyvangelist ”, that is, early customers or trial users with speci ﬁc char- acteristics –i.e. they have a problem or need, they are aware of having a problem, they are actively looking for a solution, they have even tried to put together their own solution, and they have or can acquire the funds to buy a good solution once they ﬁnd it ( Blank, 2007). After the earlyvangelists have been discovered, the startups should work closelywith them to create iterative feedback cycles that allow new solutions to be tested and the business idea to be improved incrementally, so that it gains customer validation. Testing and the subsequent validation are based upon a set ofassumptions and/or hypotheses set by the startup to postulate how its business idea will work and create value for customers, how value will be delivered to these customers and how a share of such value will be captured to ensure the startup's sustainability. This means that the startup will need to design an overall business model, that is, an ar- chitecture of value ( Ghezzi et al., 2015; Rappa, 2001 ;Teece, 2010), around its idea. When testing out their business models, entrepreneurs should in- troduce what is known as the “business model canvas ”(Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010 ), according to which three pillars and nine para- meters are assigned to a business model, as shown in Table 1. During its search phase, Customer Development,
assigned to a business model, as shown in Table 1. During its search phase, Customer Development, therefore, helps the startup to obtain early insights about its prospective customers. Atthis point, the startup must prove that there is a potential market for its products/services and verify that there are customers willing to acquire them. By introducing this approach, the startup can reduce the likelihood of it failing. This is because the initial business model and the as- sumptions on which it was based, which in the main stem from the entrepreneur's personal perception of reality, have been tested and possibly veri ﬁed in the ﬁeld through repeated interaction with potential customers, and the learning outcome derived from these tests comesfrom the real world –in line with the directive to “get out of the building ”advocated by Blank (2007) . The “execute ”phase follows the search phase. Once the business model and the customers are validated, the startup can create its marketdemand through investments in marketing and sales spending, and it can scale up its business by structuring its functional units and in- troducing customer development teams ( Blank and Dorf, 2012 ). The Lean Startup, a term coined by Eric Ries (2011) , revisits Cus- tomer Development and consists of a business approach where the aim is to change the way companies are built and new products are laun- ched. As with Customer Development, the formulation of falsi ﬁable hy- potheses plays a critical role in triggering the Lean Startup process. Thetwo key assumptions made by entrepreneurs are: (i) the value hy- pothesis –testing whether a product or service really delivers value to customers once they are using it; and (ii) the growth hypothesis – testing how new customers will discover a product or service ( Ries, 2011 ;Hartman, 2013 –p 6). The Lean Startup introduces two new concepts: Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) –artefacts used for the fast and quantitative market testing of a product or
Viable Products (MVPs) –artefacts used for the fast and quantitative market testing of a product or product feature –and pivots, where certain BM elements are changed in response to failed hypotheses tests. Accordingto Ries, a MVP is “that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customerswith the least e ﬀort” or, in a simpler way, “the smallest thing you can build that lets you quickly make it around the build/measure/learnloop ”(Ries, 2011). Unlike other methods for managing early stage ventures, the Lean Startup Approach also balances the strong direction imposed by a founder's vision with the need for redirection following market feed- back ( Eisenmann et al., 2012), thereby introducing a third element. In addition, when Ries describes LSAs, a central part is given over to the Build-Measure-Learn feedback-loop, which in turn is inﬂ uenced by the Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA) loop developed by themilitary strategist John Boyd as a tool for winning battles. Behind the feedback loop is the idea that entrepreneurs should get their products into the hands of customers –in the form of a MVP –as fast as possible in order to test it out and receive feedback that can be used to reject orvalidate their assumptions. The goal of Lean Startup is to minimize the time spent going through the feedback loop, the implication being that the startups need to build faster, measure themselves faster and learn faster ( Ries, 2011 ). Experiments and tests within the loop can also be iterated, as startups should formulate and validate their problem hy-potheses, create and validate their solutions to this problem, and Fig. 1. Customer development ( Blank and Dorf, 2012 ).A. Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945– 960 947
conclude by validating the remaining elements of the business model built around the solution, as well as seeing how to scale it up and ac- quire customers ( Gustafsson and Qvillberg, 2012; Heiramo, 2013 ). Fig. 2 depicts the process faced by an entrepreneur when following the Lean Startup Approach. Customer Development –with speci ﬁc reference to its “search ” phase –and the Lean Startup together make up the Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs), used by entrepreneurs when validating their digitalstartup business model. Ries (2011) andBlank (2013) both concur that, while traditional methods for New Product Development largely fo-cused on testing products, services and value propositions ( Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995; Krishnan and Ulrich, 2001 ), LSAs should help to experiment on all elements of the startups' BM. Recent attempts were made to frame the Lean Startup and Customer Development in the academic literature, with somewhat unconnected or partly inconsistent results. Frederiksen and Brem (2017) were in- volved conceptually in looking for theories that possibly back the LeanStartup, while not addressing the advantages and disadvantages of applying the method. Yang et al. (2018) investigated the en- trepreneurial reasoning behind the Lean Startup –which they divide into the phases of search and execute –andﬁnd that search actions are associated to e ﬀectual logics, while execution actions are instead as- sociated to causation logics. Nevertheless, in their hypotheses, they appear to equate the Lean Startup with Customer Development, as search and execution are phases of the latter rather than the former. Contigiani and Levinthal (2018) carried out research into the Lean Startup's theoretical roots and antecedents, but largely without men-tioning entrepreneurial theories. Ghezzi and Cavallo (2018) discussed the Lean Startup and Customer Development jointly because of their similarities and partial overlapping, introducing the notion of LSAs.They relate LSAs to Agile
similarities and partial overlapping, introducing the notion of LSAs.They relate LSAs to Agile Development and Business Model Innovation, although any detailed discussion of LSAs having roots in En- trepreneurship theory lay outside their scope and aim. Despite the growing interest in LSAs, extant studies still show only limited con- sensus about the origins of these approaches and their related tools; moreover, scholars often adopt a conceptual stance (e.g. Contigiani and Levinthal, 2018 ;Frederiksen and Brem, 2017 ) that needs to be backed by empirical investigation. 3. Methods This study is based on a mixed-method approach where quantitative and qualitative studies follow one from the other ( Castro et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2007). In mixed-methods research, qualitative methods are often employed to help explain and expand quantitative ﬁndings (Creswell and Clark, 2011 ;Molina-Azorin, 2012 ). More speci ﬁcally, this study uses a sequential approach by com- bining a quantitative questionnaire-based survey on a sample of digitalstartups (step 1) with qualitative semi-structured interviews on a sub- sample of digital startups representing polar or highly relevant cases – identiﬁed by their answers to the questionnaire (step 2). 3.1. Survey on digital startups In the quantitative step of this research, our aim was to collect large- scale information to address the following broad research questions: if and how do digital startups apply Lean Startups Approaches (RQ1); what are the results obtained (RQ2); what do they perceive to be the main advantages and disadvantages stemming from the adoption and implementation of LSAs (RQ3); and how do digital startups use the LSA in conjunction with other entrepreneurial approaches and tools for launching startups (RQ4). The sample was obtained from an original database of digital startups based and operating in Italy that received funding from formal investors –i.e. independent venture capital funds, corporate venture
received funding from formal investors –i.e. independent venture capital funds, corporate venture capital funds, government venture capital funds –and/or informal in- vestors –i.e. business angels, angel networks, crowdfunding platforms, family o ﬃces and venture incubators (e.g. see Bruton et al., 2010, 2015; Kerr et al., 2011 ) between 2012 and 2017. This database was set up within a broader research project and, since 2012, has been mappingItalian-funded digital startups by triangulating data from all actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem –e.g. formal and informal investors, incubators and accelerators, governmental institutions, startups asso-ciations and the startups themselves. Formal and informal investors mostly di ﬀered in terms of whether the organization backing them was structured or largely unstructured,as well as whether they used a systematic or unsystematic approach to carry out the startup's due diligence before making an investment (Drover et al., 2017 ). We decided to focus on funded startups and in- clude both sources of equity capital ﬁnancing because this meant that our study looked at high-quality startups that had passed either aTable 1 The business model canvas ( Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010 ).

formal or an informal due diligence process, allowing us also to po- tentially contrast and compare the di ﬀerent roles that LSAs play in enabling or hindering the funding process. The original database, as of January 10th 2017 (when the survey was launched), held 484 digital startups that were still active and wereor had been funded by formal and/or informal investors. To collect data, an e-mail based survey was sent to the personal or business e-mail addresses of a representative digital startup founder, which had previously been collected and archived in the original da- tabase, together with information about the contact person in the founding team to be interviewed for research purposes. It was im- portant to interview the startups' founders since they were the people behind the business ideas to which the LSAs were being applied, and they had control over the development processes enabled by LSAs. A pilot survey was submitted to three digital startup founders who were willing to provide feedback on its structure and the clarity of the questions. This kind of feedback allowed us to revise the order of our questions and the wording of some of them, as well as tweaking the list of items to be included as alternative options, to come up with the ﬁnal version of the survey. Thisﬁnal survey was broken into four sections of questions covering the adoption of LSAs, the results, the advantages and disadvantages,and their integration with other entrepreneurial theories, approaches and tools. The full list of survey questions is given in Appendix 1. Where the answers to the questions were not of a Boolean yes/no type or chosen from a set of items, they were given on a four-point Likert scale, where the mid-points choices were eliminated in order to polarize results and help us to select the startups best suited to a qua- litative interview ( Garland, 1991 ). The initial personalized contact and subsequent telephone follow- ups ran up to March 15th 2017 ( Baruch and
personalized contact and subsequent telephone follow- ups ran up to March 15th 2017 ( Baruch and Holtom, 2008; Porter and Whitcomb, 2003 ), at which point we had received 235 answers, giving a survey response rate of 48.55%. After cleaning this list by removingincomplete answers, the remaining 227 complete records was used as the basis for our quantitative data analysis. The respondents belonged to various ﬁelds of application in the broad digital industry, which also spans a number of traditional mar- kets ( Bharadwaj et al., 2013 ), and the sample was well-representative of the database's whole population in terms of industry and averagestartup age. Table 2 shows the distribution of the sample across dif- ferent ﬁelds of application. Given the rather explorative nature of this ﬁrst analysis on a wide sample of digital startups engaged in LSA practices ( Eisenhardt, 1989 ), the data analysis mostly relied on descriptive statistics to show the aggregations, means and trends that could be further explored through qualitative analysis. On this point, quantitative analysis provides the means to inform theoretical sampling in qualitative analysis ( Creswelland Clark, 2011 ;Molina-Azorin, 2012): as such, by leveraging on the contribution by Johnson et al. (2007) on the qualitative-quantitative continuum, this mixed methods research can be de ﬁned as “qualitative dominant ”. 3.2. Interviews with signi ﬁcant digital startups The qualitative step of the research consisted in gathering insights that could help to explain and expand the ﬁndings gained from RQs 1, 2 and 3, while further exploring how to address RQ4, which covered the LSAs and how they connected with other entrepreneurial approaches and tools. This step was designed as a set of semi-structured qualitative in- terviews ( Eisenhardt, 1989 ;Eisenhardt  and Graebner, 2007 ;Yin, 1984), starting from a protocol of questions similar to those of the survey (seeAppendix 2), although these questions were more
of questions similar to those of the survey (seeAppendix 2), although these questions were more explorative and open to the informants going o ﬀtopic or including any new aspects, thus allowing innovative issues to emerge from the open discussion(Walsham, 1995 ;Yin, 1984 ). Case sampling was performed theoretically ( Eisenhardt, 1989; Meredith, 1998 ) and was informed by the outcome of the quantitative research step. The cases were selected according to their heterogeneityin terms of: (i) within-case consistency or inconsistency of answers to the survey; and (ii) cross-case polarities and signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences. By carrying out multiple qualitative interviews, it was possible to generalize the results more ﬁrmly ( Meredith, 1998) and undertake a comparative analysis of the ﬁndings, because the theoretical sample potentially contained extreme cases, polar types or niche situations(Meredith, 1998 ). Hence, in order to include the digital startups and associated informants in the qualitative research, they needed to show ahigh level of consistency or inconsistency in terms of their internal positioning towards the adoption of LSAs, or strong similarities or dif- ferences when compared to other startups. The face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were, therefore, the primary source of information when collecting data in this research step. Between May and October 2017, 51 digital startups which had answered the questionnaire were contacted to ask for a follow-up in- terview. Of them, 37 startups agreed, and 32 of them were eventually interviewed (14% of the sample of respondents, and 62.7% of the subsample of startups contacted in the qualitative research step). The interviews were held in a semi-structured format with the di- gital startups' founders and lasted on average 1 h and 8 min. For the data analysis, the interviewees' responses were ﬁrst recorded and fully transcribed. If any information was still unclear and/or more data was needed, the informants were
transcribed. If any information was still unclear and/or more data was needed, the informants were later contacted by telephone to ask for clariﬁ cation. Then, following the recommendations set by Eisenhardt (1989) ,a within-case data analysis was carried out, so as to generate the neces- sary insight into the issues under scrutiny. A subsequent cross-case analysis made it possible to compare the various responses from in- formants belonging to the di ﬀerent digital startups. Interview content analysis was performed for both the within-case and the cross-case analyses, borrowing the use of open coding from Grounded Theory methodology ( Glaser and Strauss, 1967 ;Strauss and Corbin, 1998), as this method is suitable for studying complex phe-nomena as it applies a clearly de ﬁned procedure based on coding –i.e. using labels, concepts and words to produce theory from interviews,rather than the mere ﬁnding of facts ( Glaser and Strauss, 1967 ). The empirical material was codi ﬁed through textual analysis, and stored in a software archive. In accordance with Eisenhardt (1989) , as virtually no research can be based on a completely “clean theoretical slate ”(p. 536), coding was guided by the few extant studies where there was the explicit attempt to frame LSAs in theory ( Contigiani and Levinthal, 2018; Frederiksen and Brem, 2017 ;Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2018 ;Yang et al., 2018 ). The litera- ture streams seen as plausible antecedents or theoretical roots for LSAsTable 2 Sample characteristics.

were used as the lenses through which to interpret the empirical results of the interviews. “In vivo ”and constructed codes were collected for each interview (Glaser and Strauss, 1967 ), recording the exact wording used by in- formants to describe the processes for adopting and implementing LSAs,as well as the constructed wording introduced by the researcher. By contrasting and comparing the content of di ﬀerent interviews itera- tively, we were able to identify any idiosyncratic positions as well as theaggregated clusters of concepts ( Clark et al., 2010 ), and these helped us to deepen our understanding and gain further insight into the quanti-tative research results. The results of the coding process, which consists of identifying a selection of codes and concepts and the broader themes derived from them, are given in Table 3. Beyond the themes determined straightforwardly through the various sections of the questionnaire – i.e. LSA adoption, results, advantages and disadvantages, com- plementary entrepreneurial methods and tools (not shown in Table 3) – other themes connected with Entrepreneurship, Strategic Managementand Innovation Management research emerged from the interviews.These themes are further elaborated in Section 5 –Discussion. To conclude, the interviews' results were reviewed and con ﬁrmed by the interviewees, to correct any potential errors or bias and ulti- mately enhance the correctness of our interpretations. 4. Results The results from our mixed-methods research are presented as a combination of quantitative ﬁndings derived from the survey on digital startups and the qualitative ﬁndings derived from the semi-structured interviews conducted on a subsample of the survey's respondents. The results are aggregated around the four broad research questions addressed in this study.4.1. Lean Startup Approaches - adoption The results concerning RQ1 about LSA adoption are given in Table 4 below. With regards to whether digital startups had adopted Lean
LSA adoption are given in Table 4 below. With regards to whether digital startups had adopted Lean Startup Approaches, a striking 93% of the sample of founders declared that they had explicitly adopted and implemented LSAs with the purpose of driving the launch and development of their startup. Startups where these approaches have been adopted do so mostly to achieve a fast product-market ﬁt: they are well-aware of the need to run experiments on their original version of the business model and toverify whether their business model is aligned to the market's needs;alternatively, it could even drive or cater to new latent needs. The founders also know that timing and speed are instrumental in achieving and sustaining competitive advantage in such a crowded and dynamic environment as that of digital industries. As the founder and CEO of a mobile applications startup put it: “All of our apps look great to us and to our developers –because we came up withthem and sweated over them for months. So it's pretty obvious, isn't it? Whatis way less obvious is knowing if users are ultimately going to like them as much as we do and we need to test that out ”. Another founder and marketing president of an Internet of Things startup said that “[…] there's no such thing as a good idea if there's no market for it: we need to ﬁnd out whether there is a market out there or not ASAP and lean startup is just what I need ”. The founders of digital startups also rely on LSA to address another traditional critical issued faced by any startup: resource scarcity. The founder in a machine learning startup claimed that “LSAs give our team clear guidelines and a process to minimize the resources we need in theproduct-testing phase, which is what we need to burn less cash ”. LSAs are also seen as a way to put the complex and oftenTable 3 Codes, concepts and themes.

unstructured launch and development stages of a startup into a common and formal framework. As a cloud computing startup's founder claimed: “our startup is a living organism in its early years …just like a baby. How can you sum up your early years with one word? I'd say: messy.Many things are going on, you want to be part of them all, and you still cannot ﬁgure out what to do or how to do it, and sometimes why you have to do it. Well, lean approaches tell you what should be done ﬁrst and what's next, while allowing you to keep your ﬂexibility. It's a kind of step-by-step ﬂow that allows iterations but helps you to put order into a messy en- vironment ”. A limited number of informants also declared that they had adopted LSAs to ﬁnd more recent alternatives to traditional business planning. In the words of the CEO of a mobile payment startup, LSAs were im-plemented “[…] in order to avoid mere desk research, as Blank said ”.O n this point, others also found that adopting LSAs was something in-vestors pushed and evaluated positively. The marketing manager in a mobile applications startup said that “when I and [co-founders] ﬁrst met a business angel, she asked: ‘Did you use lean startup approaches to see if your ideas make sense? ’. We said we hadn't, and she told us to come back after we had got some test results –which is what we did, and she became our ﬁrst investor ”. When it comes to the decision not to adopt LSAs, the main reason seems to be that the startup had apparently already achieved product- market ﬁt, so no other processes were required to verify this point. Interestingly, when these startups were analyzed in detail through thequalitative interviews, what emerged was that almost all of them had beenﬁnanced through Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) funds, with the mother company already providing a sort of “captive market ”for the startup to tap into. Their answer was hence probably unconsciously biased, as there was this pre-existing corporate-startup
answer was hence probably unconsciously biased, as there was this pre-existing corporate-startup relationship, although the literature claims that even CVC-backed startups could probably bene ﬁt from the adoption of LSAs. The second reason was that startups perceived LSAs either as inapplicable to the startup's business idea and domain or too complex compared to traditional business planning. The founder of a big data startup said that “Lean Startup is cool but it's not for everyone: we sell business-to-business solutions, so who shouldour target evangelists be? Incumbent companies? How do you test on com- panies without jeopardizing your potential partnership with them? ”.A s another entrepreneur in arti ﬁcial intelligence put it: “Lean is only ap- parently simple, but if you go beneath the surface, there is a lot of com- plexity, mostly related to what an MVP is and who your trial users should be - and how do you even get in touch with them? ”. With regards to the LSA-related sources of information and training that the digital startups could draw on, most informants claimed that they practiced lean approaches when the startup was being incubated or accelerated. Di ﬀerent founders agreed with the CEO of a mobile application startup, who stated that: “A good 90% of our training sessions with tutors, coaches and mentors were actually about lean principles applied to our startups ”; and “here in [incubator's name], lean startup is every- where …you're literally ﬂooded with lean principles, there's no escaping from it! [Laughing] ”. Dedicated workshops were another major source for training, although their results often did not meet the startuppers' ex-pectations: the Chief of Operations in a social media startup claimed that “lean startup workshops, tutorial and training sessions spring up like mushrooms, but most are just [obscenity] and a total waste of time, so youneed to be very careful about who's running and holding them ”. In this adverse selection setting,
to be very careful about who's running and holding them ”. In this adverse selection setting, bad choices are set to play an increasing rolein the adoption of LSAs, as more and more actors and institutions start holding courses and training sessions –sometimes apparently picking their stu ﬀout of thin air rather than having any real expertise. To solve this matter, many startups are turning to universities and university- based schools of management and/or entrepreneurship out ﬁts.“Lean Startup courses in a college are rather expensive, but they're becoming moreand more hands-on and practice-oriented rather than purely theoretical; so they're a good way to gain professional and certi ﬁed knowledge ”,a sa n Industry 4.0 founder and marketing manager said.Several entrepreneurs also declared that they learned about LSAs on their own by reading the books written by Blank (2007) ,Blank and Dorf (2012) andRies (2011) . A very small number of founders also declared that it was their investors who made the suggestion to adopt LSAs –and this largely overlaps with the informants who claimed that they hadadopted these tools to “please investors ”. Several insightful considerations emerge on the use of speci ﬁc LSA concepts, tools and models. The most widely used tool is the Business Model Canvas, whereby “[…] we easily make our business idea come down to earth ”–as the CEO of one eCommerce startup said –in a “uniﬁed, simple and straightforward way ”– according to the Chief Financial O ﬃcer in a security startup. In turn, the startups seemly adopt MVPs to outline the most important functions of their business idea and possibly enable the early interaction with customers. The whole build- measure-learn loop based on the MVP was also applied by startups striving to hear the “customers' own voices and opinions based on some- thing they touch and feel ”–as a founder of a startup in digital wearables said, and so prepare for pivoting. The least used concepts, according to the
in digital wearables said, and so prepare for pivoting. The least used concepts, according to the quantitative analysis, were earlyvangelists and falsi ﬁable hy- potheses, and this ﬁnding relates to the disadvantages and criticalities that startups encounter when applying lean processes (see Section 4.3 ). Surprisingly, a few startups declared that they adopted all the models atthe same time, as if they somewhat personalized the LSAs during their implementation processes in line with the startups' speci ﬁc needs: “I found the [business model] canvas and MVPs quite useful, while frankly Inever used those falsi ﬁable hypotheses and evangelists …they sounded a bit tricky ”. Such cherry-picking and piecemeal approach may have sig- niﬁcant implications when assessing the LSA results and performance. The last point concerning the adoption of LSAs referred to the stage of startup development when the practices were leveraged. Here, many startups claimed they employed LSAs mainly in their early stage de- velopment, when getting their business model ready for the informal investors' approval; however, the founders also observed that adoptingLSAs could prove useful in later stage development, as “VCs look for indications about market traction, and lean startup approaches can showthem your traction ”–as a founder in a mobile services startup put it. It was apparently unusual to adopt LSAs at the seed stage, where thebusiness idea is at its embryonic stage of development, because, at that time, “the idea is too fuzzy even in your own head, you could probably sketch a canvas around it, but rather than embarking on a full lean startupor customer development process, you ask around for informal feedback, quizzing your network of peers, while you are asking them for pre-seed and seed money ”, as noted by an entrepreneur in a IoT-related startup. A number of startups also declared that they continuously used LSAs incycles and iterations, since, as a CEO in a mobile payment startup
they continuously used LSAs incycles and iterations, since, as a CEO in a mobile payment startup said, “you really never stop pivoting and iterating a digital service ”. 4.2. Lean Startup Approaches - results Theﬁndings concerning RQ2 on LSA results and outcomes are given inTable 5 below. With regards to the duration of LSAs implementation, the founders declared that it took them an average of 8.2 months to go from the ﬁrst set of falsi ﬁable hypotheses embedded in a business model and a MVP, to achieving a reasonable product-market ﬁt that gave them the go- ahead to proceed with scaling –with a lower bound of 4.1 months and an upper bound of 13.5 months. During the interviews, it became clearthat changes to the LSAs' “lead time ”depended mainly on the following reasons: (i) ability or inability to ﬁnd team consensus about the right way to set hypotheses and design an initial business model; (ii) abilityor inability to craft the right MVP and to properly prioritize the MVP tests; and (iii) ability or inability to spot the right cluster of ear- lyvangelists or trial users, engage them and get informed feedback from them. The LSA length was clearly correlated to its cost –in terms of capital expenditure for equipment and, above all, operational ex-penditure in human resources, materials and advertising –such asA. Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945– 960 951
AdWord campaigns –both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the capital raised. The best performers in the sample, those keeping the LSA im- plementation length and cost to a minimum, felt that “the key here was to make all founders agree on one single statement that summarized our view on the startup and its best future ”–as stated by the CEO of a machine learning startup –while “cutting all features that were making our MVP too‘bulky ’and too similar to a real prototype, rather than a pretotype as it should be ”–in the words of an Industry 4.0 CFO. This was coupled with “a few weeks spent in ﬁnding where our target audience actually hung out, to target the right early users. It may have looked like time wasted, but as itturned out it clearly wasn't. It made us save a lot of time repeating tests in diﬀerent contexts and with di ﬀerent user groups ”. The low performers argued that their time and costs went out of control because of severalfactors, the most relevant being: “the inability to make plans about when to start and, most of all, end testing ”–as stated by the COO of an eCommerce platform startup; “our probably inaccurate de ﬁnition of the right metrics to use and the right prospective clients to include in the ex- periments caught us up in a never-ending iteration process ”–in the words of the CEO of an Internet of Things startup; and “our unwillingness to pivot was based on the sunk costs we had already incurred in device de- velopment ”–as the CEO of a digital wearables startup admitted. The last survey question on LSA results covered overall satisfaction. Surprisingly, although most digital startups by far said they used the approaches and that they saw something in return their implementation eﬀorts, the overall satisfaction hit a relatively poor 2.8 in a four-point Likert scale, leading to slightly less than moderate satisfaction. Thequalitative interviews revealed that behind this mild satisfaction was the fact that they recognized the
interviews revealed that behind this mild satisfaction was the fact that they recognized the complexities and possible drawbacks of the approach (as discussed in Section 4.3 ), something that even the best performers experienced. “All in all, I enjoyed applying LSAs and I think they were bene ﬁcial for our startup in its early stages of development. Having said this, these apparently pragmatic tools sometimes work great intheory but not so well in practice, and did they make us sweat! ”, the founder and general manager of a big data startup said. This was reinforced inan interview with another founder of an Internet of Things startup, who stated that “lean startup tools, are, let's say, a great start …but they need a lot of work to de ﬁne, design and re ﬁne them before they're ready to tell you something you need to know about your company and its market ”. 4.3. Lean Startup Approaches - advantages and disadvantages Table 6 summarizes the main ﬁndings gained from RQ3 on the principle advantages and disadvantages of LSAs. With regards to the advantages of implementing LSAs, most digital startup informants claimed that these had helped “signiﬁcantly in cutting the time and costs we had expected for developing the startup, especially during testing ”–as stated by the CEO of a mobile applications startup. She continued by saying that “I have experience with previous startups where we didn't use startup and customer development, and I can say thatour savings here in time and costs are remarkable. Of course, this happens ifyou learn to use the right tools properly ”. Discovering and validating the alignment between the startup's business model and the needs of itstarget market was also a key outcome stemming from the adoption and implementation of LSAs: “before we used LSAs, we really had no clue as to whether customers would actually like and be willing to buy our products.This changed radically after they sent us their feedback and we learnt from it”, as said by the
changed radically after they sent us their feedback and we learnt from it”, as said by the founder of an Industry 4.0 startup. Another advantage felt by founders implementing LSAs was that of verifying and/or knowing when to pivot, all the business model canvas parameters, which is something that goes well beyond the bundle of products and services embedded in the value proposition. As the CEO of a cloud computing startup explained, “we thought that LSAs were meant to help us verify our value proposition, but we found that it's a good set oftools to test other parts of our business model, like its channels and its revenue model ”. The COO of a mobile applications startup added that, “by applying Lean Startup and Customer Development, not only did we pivot six of the nine parameters in our canvas, we also changed two of them so radically that our launched startup looked very little like our original idea ”. Interestingly, the founders also noted that adopting LSAs made it easier for them to receive rounds of funding from formal and informal investors alike. The CEO in an eCommerce startup explained that “the evidence, metrics and ﬁgures ﬁrst shown to business angels, and later to venture capitalists, were so real and backed by testing, that they certainly helped us to demonstrate our business potential and its growth traction ”. Another entrepreneur in a mobile applications startup said that “the tools and metrics championed in lean approaches, like cohort analysis, are something investors really like. If you use them, you are showing them you really know your stu ﬀ. That's when they start trusting you and probably think: ‘I could give this guy my money ’”. A last, yet insightful, hidden advantage of adopting and im- plementing LSAs concerns their ability to force entrepreneurs to rethinktraditional Intellectual Property (IP) protection logics. In the words ofthe CEO of a machine learning startup, “when I read the books, the ﬁrst thing I thought was ‘ok, nice, but
of a machine learning startup, “when I read the books, the ﬁrst thing I thought was ‘ok, nice, but once I launch my MVP and run experi- ments, aren't I putting my ideas out there for competitors to steal? ’Yet, as I deep- dived into the lean startup philosophy, I understood that being leandoesn't mean being dumb, and rather than IP protection, it's all about speed ”. Another COO in a mobile applications startup added the following: “If you go for build-measure-learn loops and experiments, it's key to being fast. You can't just run the experiments and sit there and wait: once you get the green light, you must be ready to pivot, develop and launch at full throttle. By then competitors know you're there, but you will still have the advantage by being ﬁrst in learning what counts for your customers, and can act fast accordingly ”. Coupled with IP protection, the informants also addressed the matter of reputational risk associated to poor MVPs. Our interview with the founder of a mobile application startup shed light on a view common among digital startups: “Of course launching a sloppy MVP on your market could harm your brand: that's why you should de ﬁnitely use ‘fake brands ’when doing your experiments. Prospective customers may get upset by the fake brands' products, but, at the end of the day, they will turnto your brand's ﬁnal product once it's been thoroughly LSA-tested and is ready ”. As anticipated in the previous sections, many insights were derived from the discussion of the main disadvantages of LSAs. By combiningquantitative and qualitative data and information, a clear and true picture emerges of the weaknesses in LSAs, and this could lead to im- proving these processes. First, many founders encountered severe problems when de ﬁning and designing their MVPs, and also when designing MVP-based tests. The founder of a mobile applications startup said the following: “In line with the lean rationale, we interviewed customers as early as possible, usingan online
“In line with the lean rationale, we interviewed customers as early as possible, usingan online survey to ask them about the features of the would-be product they liked the most. We also asked how much they were willing to pay for each feature. The results were rather disappointing: as they said they liked all the functions, we learnt nothing about customer preferences …and to compoundTable 5 Quantitative results on RQ2 –LSA results and outcomes.

it, they were so unwilling to pay, there was no justi ﬁcation for our investment in any of these functions …practically speaking, that test was useless ”. This statement is revealing, as it shows how entrepreneurs still confuse MVP and MVP-based testing with marketing research: according to its ori- ginal proponents, MVP-based testing is not about market research, but is should enable the experimenting on customers' natural behaviour; tests should not refer to willingness to pay, but rather simulate an en- vironment where customers believe they are actually making a pur- chase ( Blank, 2007; Blank and Dorf, 2012; Ries, 2011 ;Ries and Euchner, 2013 ). Another entrepreneur in a social media startup complained that “In theﬁrst version of our MVP, we created a video showing how our application should work. That's something we learned from other popular lean startup cases, like Dropbox. However, beyond counting the number of times the video was watched, we learned little from the process ”. This statement shows that, when applying MVPs, it is crucial to create an MVP that isactionable, in the sense that it should trigger the customer's natural behaviour and actions that carry useful information and evidence forstartups –like registering to a beta waiting list, as in the case of Dropbox. A third point, stated by a founder in an IoT startup, showed how apparently di ﬃcult it can be to place MVPs within a business-to-busi- ness environment: “We serve companies with complex systems, so it's kind of hard for us to isolate key functions and test them on their own; whathappened when we applied the lean approach was that we ended up by creating a full prototype –and its budget was far from being cheap or lean…”. A concluding remark on MVPs from a COO in another Internet of Things startup is also worth mentioning: “Lean tells you to build a MVP, but gives you no clear guidelines or indications whatsoever on how to do so!”. Spotting earlyvangelists and trial users is another
or indications whatsoever on how to do so!”. Spotting earlyvangelists and trial users is another excruciating dif- ﬁcult exercise for many startups. As a founder in a mobile applications startup noted: “We kept on asking ourselves ‘who, which customers, should we test our business model on? ’, but we never came to a de ﬁnite conclusion. We eventually launched our MVP after testing indiscriminately across ourtarget market, with mixed results ”. Another marketing manager in a machine learning startup highlighted a further issue relating to iden-tifying and engaging with trial users: “we identiﬁ ed our target segment and actively engaged with several in ﬂuential users, receiving interesting feedback from them. We then found another potential target segment, en- gaged with those users too, and received totally di ﬀerent feedback compared to the ﬁrst lot. What were we meant to do with all this assorted feedback? And how were we to know when to stop ?” Many of these drawbacks, which on the surface were connected to LSAs, stemmed from the fact that startups seldom see the need for setting assumptions and hypotheses about themselves, their market andtheir customers (this was highlighted in Section 4.1 , where we saw that, among the lean concepts, falsi ﬁable hypotheses were the least used). Hypotheses were often taken for granted, or de ﬁned too broadly. Somefounders did not address the most penetrating questions about their customers and what they want, their pains and gains ( Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010), which ultimately made it di ﬃcult for them to ﬁnd out who their earlyvangelist actually were. This emerged from the words of a CEO of a mobile payment startup, who admitted honestly that: “The problem was never the process. It was us. We never really accepted that wehad to fully adopt it in all its steps, with an open mind and true commitment: that's why it did not pay oﬀ as we had expected ”. In line with this sometimes limited commitment to adopting and implementing
as we had expected ”. In line with this sometimes limited commitment to adopting and implementing LSAs as a whole, the ﬁndings of both the survey and the interviews revealed a common misconception about lean approaches,their reach and their role in supporting startup development. The in- formants pointed out that the LSAs gave very little support in spotting industry-related opportunities and threats hidden in external trends or in the market's structural determinants; or they received poor indica- tions about the startup's sources of competitive advantage, and about whether such sources could actually help to beat the competition. Both of these arguments show that entrepreneurs may tend to have un-realistic expectations about lean approaches and overestimate their own ability to support startup development. In actual fact, analyzing the features of the external industry –alongside those of potential customers –as well as the startup's internal sources of di ﬀerentiation goes well beyond the scope of LSAs. This interesting ﬁnding also in- dicates that digital entrepreneurs must complement LSAs with supple-mentary strategy analysis models and an overall business strategy. 4.4. Lean Startup Approaches and other entrepreneurship methods and tools Theﬁndings that relate to RQ4 - how digital startups connect and combine the LSAs with other entrepreneurial tools for launching startups, as well as their overall business strategy –are given in Table 7. Aﬁrst, signi ﬁcantﬁnding emerged concerning the approach most widely used in conjunction with LSAs, with a striking 91% of the founders saying that they use Business Planning. This result may seem surprising, as Customer Development was proposed as an alternative to business plans, as the latter kept the startup's development too far re- moved from reality for too long ( Blank, 2007 ). Nearly all the startupsTable 6 Quantitative results on RQ3 –LSA advantages and disadvantages. Research item Results Main advantages of LSAs

declared, however, that they had solved this false dichotomy by fruit- fully integrating LSA-derived data into the ﬁrst versions of their busi- ness plan, thus combining a “get out of the building ”stance with a well- structured document describing their strategic, marketing, operational, economic- ﬁnancial, organizational and human resource-related plans (Delmar and Shane, 2003 ).“Lean startup testing data and metrics proved a useful input to our business plan, where data came from our experiments with customers rather than from secondary sources ”, claimed the mar- keting manager in a mobile applications startup. This arrangement alsohelped founders to raise capital, since “[…] angels ﬁrst, and VCs later, seemed to really appreciate the combination of real-world data from theLSAs and the traditional business plan structure ”. The informants also emphasized the fact that they could combine LSAs with Agile methods ( Beck et al., 2001 ;Nerur et al., 2005; Holmström et al., 2006 ;De Cesare et al., 2010 ;Cram and Newell, 2016 ), toﬁll some of the gaps in Lean Startup and Customer Devel- opment. More speci ﬁcally, the founders were keen to introduce methods such as SCRUM and sprints ( Schwaber and Sutherland, 2011 ), as well as Feature-Driven Development ( Abrahamsson, 2003 ). The COO in an Internet of Things startup said that “sprints gave us timelines for iteration cycles in the build-measure-learn loops ”, while another founder in a security startup observed that “Feature-Driven Development helped us to deﬁne the features to be embedded in the MVPs ”. Moreover, digital entrepreneurs appeared not to underestimate the role of the traditional Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats(SWOT) analysis ( Lorange, 1980) in feeding the LSAs: “Before you even start any lean development process, you should be well-aware of what isgoing on in your target market, its trends, opportunities and threats, as well as of what you can oﬀ er in that market, what really makes you di
and threats, as well as of what you can oﬀ er in that market, what really makes you di ﬀerent from your competitors and will make you win in the long run ”, as the CEO of an Industry 4.0 startup explained. 5. Discussion This study examines how digital startups' adopt and implement Lean Startup Approaches, pointing to a number of opportunities and issues that could be addressed to enhance the value of LSAs for digital en- trepreneurship theory and practice. 5.1. Framing LSAs within entrepreneurship theory With its insights, this research indicated a number of contact points between LSAs and other theories that are worth discussing and clar- ifying. With regards to the theoretical foundations of the Lean Startup Approaches, the empirical ﬁndings of this study back the claims made in the few recent works that looked into the antecedents of LSAs(Contigiani and Levinthal, 2018; Frederiksen and Brem, 2017 ;Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2018; Yang et al., 2018 ). As shown in Table 3, our qua- litative research brought up nine themes that form the theoretical roots of LSA, namely: (i) Lean; (ii) Agile; (iii) New Product Development (NPD); (iv) Real Options; (v) Organizational Learning; (vi) Business Model Innovation (BMI); (vii) E ﬀectuation; (viii) Bricolage; and (ix) Opportunity Creation. From a comprehensive overview, LSAs can hence be framed in a theoretical model where these approaches stand at the crossroads of theabove research streams and disciplines ( Fig. 3). These streams are far from being stand-alone silos and some of their key elements often partlyoverlap, as our empirical research shows. While the LSAs' relationship with themes (i) to (vi) had already been discussed in the recent works mentioned previously, the ﬁndings of this study mostly contribute to the debate on the role of LSAs with reference to Eﬀ ectuation, Bricolage and the whole theory of Entrepreneurial Opportunity. When discussing Lean Startup Approaches, the interviews with our digital startup founders
When discussing Lean Startup Approaches, the interviews with our digital startup founders largely revolved around their standpoint andreasoning, and their actions to interpret their own role of entrepreneurs in a resource-constrained and uncertain environment. With regards to the logic behind entrepreneurial behaviour, the entrepreneurs showed how adopting and implementing LSAs drove them to take an “eﬀectual ”(Sarasvathy, 2001 )o r “bricolage ”(Baker and Nelson, 2005) stance on many occasions, underscoring how theselogics are, in essence, connected to LSAs' main steps and constituting elements. Formulating hypotheses about the world's evolution and the star- tup's role in in ﬂuencing it is similar to the E ﬀectuation principle stating that the future is shaped by entrepreneurs, rather than being a mereconsequence of the past. Moreover, building a minimum viable product to experiment and test hypotheses on the market and argue for or against the viability of the startup's business model re ﬂects an e ﬀectual and bricolage-oriented logic, in the ways in which resources are perceived and used, goals areset and learning is achieved. Despite operating in a resource-constrained environment, en- trepreneurs can take full advantage of their extremely scarce resources by combining them originally into low-cost - yet highly informative - pretotypes of their value propositions –the MVPs –and then deploy them to test their BM assumptions. In addition, experimenting and testing e ﬃciently though iterations and short startup-customer loops that provide valuable feedback is alsoconsistent with Eﬀ ectuation and Bricolage, in terms of having the ﬂexibility to handle and even exploit unexpected contingent events and information brought up by the experiments. At this stage, the startup'sparamount objectives boil down to minimizing upfront investments during the initial learning phases, in line with the concept of a ﬀordable loss, while making do with limited bootstrapped resources (
in line with the concept of a ﬀordable loss, while making do with limited bootstrapped resources ( Baker  and Nelson, 2005 ;Fisher, 2012; Sarasvathy, 2001). This study hence empirically supports the conceptual claim that LSAs provide operational support to E ﬀectuation and Bricolage in a systematic and scienti ﬁc way, overcoming in this manner the heuristic approach to problem solving –based on intuition, unclear paths and somewhat casual attempts –that traditionally went hand-in-hand with these logics and, to some extent, limited their e ﬀective implementation. On a bigger picture, another insightful contribution emanating from this empirical research concerns the theory of entrepreneurial oppor- tunities implicitly embodied by LSAs. Assuming that there are two alternative theoretical settings where opportunities can be discovered or created, entrepreneurs using LSAs take up a creational stance towards entrepreneurial opportunities, since the strategic tasks for entrepreneurs in a creational setting are to ask customers the right questions, design new experiments, remain ﬂexible and learn ( Alvarez and Barney, 2007 ).

LSAs seem to implicitly address one of the research questions for creational theory anticipated by Alvarez and Barney (2007 –p. 22) : “How can entrepreneurs use incremental, iterative and inductive pro- cesses to make decisions? ”. This study provides empirical evidence to answer this creation theory question, claiming that LSAs are the op- erational, systematic and essentially scienti ﬁc processes that enable opportunity creation through enactment. Positioning the investigation of LSAs within the debate on oppor- tunity discovery vs creation helps to bring about empirical contribu-tions for advancing entrepreneurial opportunity theory. Alvarez and Barney (2007) present these two internally consistent theoretical perspectives on opportunities as dichotomous: while dis- covery theory assumes that the environment is risky and entrepreneurs recognize and exploit opportunities by means of risk-based decision- making tools, such as the business plan ( Delmar and Shane, 2003 ), creation theory considers the environment to be uncertain and statesthat entrepreneurs form opportunities through enactment based on al- ternative iterative and incremental processes –like LSAs, as this study contends. However, what we found empirically is that, although LSAslead entrepreneurs to adopt a creational and e ﬀectual approach, other actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem still expect them to follow alargely discovery and causation approach, at least in terms of the output they produce and present (once again, the business plan), since the latter approach is more closely aligned to and compliant with their traditional “due diligence ”process based on risk assessment and man- agement ( Drover et al., 2017 ). The digital entrepreneurs interviewed solved this contrast pragma- tically by, in essence, sequencing the creational and discovery processes and tools. They ﬁrst iterate and experiment through LSAs to create opportunities and generate data, information and knowledge; they thenfeed
through LSAs to create opportunities and generate data, information and knowledge; they thenfeed such knowledge into a well-structured business plan, to discover opportunities for the scaling, market penetration and company building of their startups. The turning point for moving from a creational to adiscovery setting is achieving a “product-market ﬁt”, in other words, the alignment between the startup's validated business model and whatcustomers demand ( Blank, 2007 ;Blank and Dorf, 2012 ;Ries, 2011). Theﬁndings of this study suggest that, while LSAs fall into the domain of creation theory, their output –i.e. data, information and knowledge created with reference to an uncertain environment –could provide the basis for a discovery approach by being fruitfully used as input to a business plan –i.e. a collection of risk-based decision-making tools. As a result, these ﬁndings also o ﬀer an answer to the question of how uncertainty can be best converted into risk and managed by en-trepreneurs ( Frederiksen and Brem, 2017 ). LSAs' iterations, interactions and experiments can help in the transition from uncertainty, whereknowledge about opportunities is created, to risk, where knowledge is further elaborated to discover opportunities through planning. This is also in line with the assertion by Brinckmann et al. (2010) that en- trepreneurial planning must be appropriate to the circumstances. This contribution concerned with how entrepreneurial approaches, models and tools are connected, empirically bridges the two theories onentrepreneurial opportunities (creation and discovery), by positioning them within an “opportunity space ”that helps to explain the empirical ﬁndings emerging in the study ( Fig. 4). Theﬁrst wave of opportunities is created by entrepreneurs through an enactment process based on experimenting and iterating on thestartup's business model and its elements. The underlying cognitive logic driving opportunity creation in an uncertain environment is the
The underlying cognitive logic driving opportunity creation in an uncertain environment is the same as that found in E ﬀectuation and Bricolage; and the operational decision-making tools to create opportunities systematically and sci-entiﬁcally is embodied in the Lean Startup Approaches. Iterations proceed in incremental loops until the product-market ﬁt is achieved, and the business model is proven to be viable, replicable and scalable ( Blank, 2013 ;Ries, 2011 ). At this time, the decision- making context is converted from uncertain to risky, setting the scenefor entrepreneurial cognition based on causation. Entrepreneurs can then discover a second wave of opportunities through planning, where the set of decision-making tools encompassed by the business plan are such that the expected returns and the probability distributions of such returns can be estimated. These, in turn, lead to di ﬀerent alternative scenarios and related plans. As the opportunity space helps to bridge the alternative approaches to entrepreneurial opportunities, cognitive logics and operational de-cision-making tools, it is useful to note that the gap between the op- portunities created and those discovered is not clear-cut –as indicated by the vertical dotted line in Fig. 4. Iteration and planning can some- times alternate or coexist in speci ﬁc stages of startup development, as the context changes from uncertain to risky and calls for di ﬀerent en- trepreneurial logics and tools. As Alvarez and Barney (2007 –p. 19) suggested, entrepreneurs are required to make decisions using context-appropriate tools, which will help them to form and exploit opportu- nities more e ﬀectively. Recognizing that entrepreneurial opportunities are, in essence, a doubleheader also helps to explain why both discovery and creationaltheories are internally consistent ( Alvarez and Barney, 2007 ). They are so because they can adequately depict a di ﬀerent evolutionary stage for the new venture within the opportunity
can adequately depict a di ﬀerent evolutionary stage for the new venture within the opportunity space; and all the actions that determined the evolution of the startup could be attributed ex post to one or the other theory depending on the stage that the entrepreneur orthe external observer wishes to emphasize or can recollect. 5.2. Enhancing the practical adoption and implementation of LSAs The combined results of this mixed-methods study into digital startups helped us to make sense of the practice of adopting and im- plementing LSAs, and so provide practical guidelines that are backed by theory and can help digital entrepreneurs to set this LSA process into operation. The unexpected result indicating that digital entrepreneurs are only modestly satis ﬁed by the outcome of the LSA implementation shows that these approaches are still burdened by many limitations andneed to be amended. Aﬁrst guideline to direct the adoption and implementation process examines the kind of digital startups that are encouraged to adopt these approaches. Startups backed by informal investors or independent venture capitals bene ﬁt from LSA adoption, but not just them, as even CVC-backed startups ﬁnd Lean Startup and Customer Development useful for verifying and validating their business ideas –despite maybe already having a captive market for their products and services. With regards to the stage in the startup's development lifecycle when LSAs are used, although most startups implement LSAs in their early stage, the introduction of a continuous adoption cycle that takes into fair account the di ﬀerent goals and metrics at the various stages of startup development is bene ﬁcial in supporting iterations and validations, as Fig. 4. The entrepreneurial opportunity space.A. Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945– 960 955
the internal and external contexts vary and can turn out to be uncertain, this being in line with Agile principles ( Beck et al., 2001). Not starting too late also helps startups to avoid those sunk costs that make it muchharder to pivot, as emerged from the qualitative interviews. Making bad choices in an adverse selection setting also appeared to play a role in hindering the adoption and implementation of LSAs (Jullien, 2000 ), caused at least in part by the digital startups' di ﬃculty inﬁnding the right suppliers providing courses and training, indicating that there is a strong case for properly assessing the quality of their suppliers before the training starts. This result shows that universities, colleges and research institutions will play a growing role in the digital startups' ecosystem, as the certi ﬁed means for obtaining LSA-related knowledge. To some extent, this ﬁnding also goes against some recent claims that entrepreneurship cannot be taught and a college degree does not really help people to become a startupper (e.g. see Forbes, 2012 ). As Frederiksen and Brem (2017) sharply pointed out, Eric Ries (author of The Lean Startup) has a degree himself, and his background more than likely informed his work in generating the Lean Startup. Another key suggestion for digital founders embarking on the pro- cess of LSA implementation is to place the right focus on phrasing fal- siﬁable hypotheses. These assumptions provide the basis for testing, since entrepreneurs should build their business model around them andtheir MVPs should stem from them. Assumptions were, however, too often taken for granted or deﬁ ned too broadly. Digital entrepreneurs have to realize that de ﬁning hypotheses is not a mere exercise, but acts as the operational trigger for the whole scienti ﬁc method behind LSAs. With regards to the work behind crafting the MVP, designing MVP- based experiments and running the build-measure-learn loop, several takeaways emerge from this study.
experiments and running the build-measure-learn loop, several takeaways emerge from this study. Startups should spend enough time in actually understanding who their target customers are, together with their pains, gains and needs ( Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010), and so properly identify the earlyvangelist and trial users able to provide in-formed feedback and stimulate useful learning. Once the earlyvangelists are identi ﬁed, the MVPs should be built and placed in their hands. This research highlights a signi ﬁcant dis- tinction that makes LSAs di ﬀerent from traditional approaches to startup development. MVPs are not related to marketing research, asinstead they should enable experiments on the customers' natural be- haviour. MVPs are artefacts that should have the following key char- acteristics: (i) resemble and embody the business idea; (ii) be action- able, as they should activate customer response and actions to learn from; (iii) be measurable through the MVP testing outcomes; and (iv) be less wasteful than prototypes. When possible, entrepreneurs are also encouraged to make the MVP a paid-for product rather than just a free version, to further qualify the input from early adopters who become paying customers ( Ries, 2011). This was seldom the case in the sample analyzed, thus impairing the measuring and learning stages of the loop. To design MVPs, our ﬁndings suggest that entrepreneurs can leverage Agile methods such as Feature Development Design(Abrahamsson, 2003 ) to provide guidelines on how to identify and design the minimum features and run iterations. In addition, when itcomes to running iterations, digital products and services could be run through Scrum sprint cycles ( Schwaber and Sutherland, 2011) to con- trol for time and budget. When the digital startup operates in a B2B context, our results suggest that these startups should ﬁnd their right evangelists among existing business customers by carefully assessing their customer com- panies'
evangelists among existing business customers by carefully assessing their customer com- panies' purchasing processes –as decisions about buying into the star- tup's digital solution can come from di ﬀerent stakeholders. Additionally, MVPs in a B2B environment cannot be overly “minimum ”, in the sense that they should incorporate a su ﬃcient number of features at a satisfactory level to compete with existing o ﬀers. MVP-based testing should even lead digital founders to radically rethink their views on IP protection and their approach to launching the startup. Rather than ﬁghting to control, hide and defend their business idea, LSAs place signi ﬁcant emphasis on collaboration and openness,where the key to competitive advantage is not the original know-how,but the startup's learning speed. This point is inherited from an e ﬀec- tual-type logic, which favours partnership and cooperation rather thancompetition ( Sarasvathy, 2001 ;Yang et al., 2018 ). Insights were also derived from the span and width of the process of validating and, when appropriate, pivoting the business model. This research underscores how LSAs support innovation to the whole value architecture of the digital startup's business model, including value delivery and capture as well as value creation. Changes to such value parameters can be incremental or radical, resulting in slight modi ﬁca- tions or even dramatic changes to the original business idea. AlthoughRies and Blank themselves argue that the business model of a startup is up for experimenting on ( Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2018 ;Gustafsson and Qvillberg, 2012; Hartman, 2013 ;Heiramo, 2013 ), a common mis- understanding among entrepreneurs is to place the focus of LSAs on testing product features. Our ﬁndings strengthen the belief that digital entrepreneurs should, instead, take entire business models as their unitsof analysis for experiment purposes and as the entity to which any pi- voting should apply. Moreover, and remarkably, informants often
and as the entity to which any pi- voting should apply. Moreover, and remarkably, informants often de- clared that testing on the startup's go-to-market strategy and its ex- ecution was even more important than validating the product itself. For digital entrepreneurs wishing to embark on LSAs, a major ta- keaway of this study is that a piecemeal approach, where founders cherry-pick concepts and models they like and ignore other parts, is fundamentally ﬂawed. Several founders used LSAs in a personalized, unsystematic and disconnected fashion, maybe due to poor training orto the heuristic intuitive approach they were accustomed to. They should, instead, have been fully committed to adopting the whole process: for entrepreneurs, LSAs are the means to go beyond mere heuristics and embrace a scienti ﬁc method towards entrepreneurial opportunity and action. The opposite of a piecemeal approach is what is needed, and rather than adopting bits and pieces, entrepreneurs should combine all of the LSAs' process with other tools, one of which is certainly the business plan. In line with existing studies that claim that the business plan plays an important role in linking entrepreneurship and strategic manage- ment ( Delmar and Shane, 2003; Kraus and Kauranen, 2009 ), and building on our discussion on the entrepreneurial opportunity space,our argument is that Blank's (2007) famous motto “instead of writing an intricate business plan, design a business model [and apply customerdevelopment] ”should be altered to “before writing a business plan […]”. LSA experiments and tests, together with their real-world results and metrics, should be used as input to the planning operations in a well-structured business plan that can be easily assessed by both formal and informal investors. As a concluding remark, this research shows that digital en- trepreneurs sometimes blame LSAs for pitfalls that fall outside the do- main and scope of these approaches, and instead relate largely to the
that fall outside the do- main and scope of these approaches, and instead relate largely to the process of formulating an overall business strategy, which startups tend to overlook. Reﬂ ecting on the startup's vision and mission, and strate- gically analyzing its internal and external environment, can better in-form the way entrepreneurs formulate their falsi ﬁable hypotheses and design their preliminary business model. Table 8 contains practical guidelines that entrepreneurs will ﬁnd useful to follow when adopting and implementing LSAs. 6. Conclusions This study presented a ﬁrst large scale research into if and how digital startups adopt and implement Lean Startups Approaches. The ﬁndings emerge from a mixed-method combining quantitative and qualitative analyses, and the contributions are relevant for both thetheory and practice of entrepreneurship. In terms of value for theory, the empirical evidence shows that the entrepreneurs' behaviour when applying LSAs mirrors that described in the theories of Eﬀ ectuation and Entrepreneurial Bricolage. Looking atA. Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945– 960 956
the bigger picture, the ﬁndings support the claim that LSAs are a set of operational, systematic and scienti ﬁc decision-making tools for sup- porting entrepreneurial opportunity creation: entrepreneurs use LSAs to make sense of the opportunities they create, rather than to discover and plan around them. Empirical evidence, however, shows that entrepreneurs solve the creation vs discovery dichotomy pragmatically by sequencing their use of LSAs and business planning. This suggests that there is an “oppor- tunity space ”that can bridge the various alternative theoretical views on entrepreneurial actions, cognitive logics, decision-making contexts and decision-making processes and tools. In terms of value for practice, this study can provide a set of guidelines and real-world insights into the adoption and implementa- tion of LSAs, and this can extend the anecdotal evidence currently available about common practice among digital entrepreneurs, while suggesting a move towards combining these approaches with other agile, entrepreneurial and strategic models.This study's limitations mostly refer to the following: sampling bias –i.e. focus on a speci ﬁc country and on funded digital startups –which could have in ﬂuenced the statistical and theoretical samples selected; and observer bias ( Yin, 1984 ), which could have distorted the inter- viewees' perception of the interviewer's questions, and/or the inter- viewer's interpretation of the interviewees' answers. While the sound research design may have helped to amend these limitations, future studies could explore di ﬀerent samples of startups - e.g. non-digital startups, or non-funded ones –and other countries, while investigating how to combine Lean Startup Approaches systematically with the other theoretical and practical streams indicated in this study.

While LSAs are gaining momentum in the ecosystem surrounding digital startups, they still su ﬀer from poor theoretical foundations and operational issues that hinder their adoption and implementation. The aim of this study is to go beyond recalling anecdotal and single-case examples and, throughmixed-methods research involving 227 digital startups, provide a ﬁrst large-scale analysis of: (i) if and how digital startups apply Lean Startups Approaches; (ii) the ensuing results; (iii) the main advantages and dis-advantages that stem from adopting and implementing LSAs; and (iv) how digital startups connect and combinethe LSAs with other entrepreneurial approaches and tools for launching startups. The ﬁndings reveal that most of the sample has adopted LSAs and obtained several bene ﬁts from their use. A list of practical guidelines on how to solve the existing drawbacks and enhance the eﬀ ectiveness of adopting and implementing LSAs is hence pro- posed. To conclude, a framework for organizing the empirical ﬁndings is put forward, where LSAs are inserted into the entrepreneurship theory debate on E ﬀectuation, Entrepreneurial --- where LSAs are inserted into the entrepreneurship theory debate on E ﬀectuation, Entrepreneurial Bricolage and Opportunity Creation. Suggestions are then provided on how to sequence and bridge eﬀ ectuation and causation logics and decision- making tools in an “entrepreneurial opportunities space” . 1. Introduction “There are three principal means of acquiring knowledge …observation of nature, re ﬂection, and experimentation. Observation collects facts; reﬂection combines them; experimentation veri ﬁes the result of that combination ”. (Denis Diderot, 1753 ) 1.1. Reasoning behind the study Entrepreneurial endeavours carry with them an abundance of ac- tivities that entrepreneurs must perform in order to acquire tangible and intangible resources ( Barney, 1991, 2001) and transform them into new ventures or startups. As the French philosopher Denis Diderot (1966) wrote, there are three principle means of acquiring knowledge available to us: observation of nature, re ﬂection and experimentation. These mirror what is also required from entrepreneurs, as they need to observe their surroundings closely when trying to identify potential opportunities ( Shane and Venkataraman, 2000 ). Once an opportunity has been detected, these entrepreneurs must think hard about how tocombine their resources creatively and originally ( Ireland et al., 2003 ) so that they become heterogeneous –i.e. they create value for custo- mers, yet are rare and costly to imitate ( Barney, 2001 )–and on how to mould a value proposition and a startup around this unique pattern of resources. After this, entrepreneurs must test their design ( Kerr et al., 2014 ) to see whether their startup is likely to create, deliver and cap- ture value is a way that will be accepted by their target customers and, therefore, be viable. This ﬁnal action is needed to validate the overall startup business model, in other words, its architecture of value ( Ghezzi et al., 2015 ;Rappa, 2001; Teece, 2010 ). This part is --- words, its architecture of value ( Ghezzi et al., 2015 ;Rappa, 2001; Teece, 2010 ). This part is particularly complex within the highly volatile context of digital entrepreneurship ( Autio et al., 2018 ;Nambisan, 2017 ), where opportunities are quick to arise and vanish, combined resources un- expectedly acquire or lose their original value, and testing becomes a vital feature of the startup's learning process ( Contigiani and Levinthal, 2018 ). Digital startups launching their products and services in this setting can use a recent and emerging set of practices to test out and validatetheir business model, known as Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs), which consist of Customer Development ( Blank, 2007; Blank and Dorf, 2012 ) and the Lean Startup ( Ries, 2011). These pragmatic methods for https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2018.09.017 Received 11 December 2017; Received in revised form 1 August 2018; Accepted 18 September 2018E-mail address: antonio1.ghezzi@polimi.it .Technological Forecasting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945–960 Available online 24 September 2018 0040-1625/ © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

T --- transferring the notions of Lean Manufacturing ( Womack and Jones, 1996 ) to the startups' environment are built upon a set of key principles: (i) formulating falsi ﬁable hypotheses about the business idea; (ii) em- bedding these hypotheses into a designed business model (BM); (iii) developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to replicate the product's functions and test the business model; (iv) identifying the target audi- ence or “earlyvangelists ”from whom to receive feedback; and (v) running tests with multiple iterations to make decisions about perse-vering with the business idea, letting it perish or pivoting, that is, un- dertaking a structured course of correction (according to the “build- measure-learn ”feedback loop). Although these approaches are gaining momentum within the startup community ( Breuer, 2013; Kerr et al., 2014; Kiura et al., 2014; Frederiksen and Brem, 2017 ), and sometimes are even penetrating the corporate world as they are adopted by incumbents ( Power, 2014; Ries and Euchner, 2013 ), they still lack the necessary theoretical founda- tions ( Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2018; Yang et al., 2018 ), with speci ﬁc re- ference to the extant theories on Entrepreneurship. Moreover, as the largely practitioner-oriented literature on LSAs builds on recalling past cases and anecdotal evidence, little is known concerning: (i) the actual adoption and e ﬀectiveness of these approaches in terms of assisting in the digital startups' launch; (ii) their connection to other traditionalentrepreneurial tools such as business plans; and (iii) their inclusion within more established entrepreneurial theories and logics. 1.2. Purpose and research questions This study hence sets forth as its objective to go beyond recalling anecdotal and single-case examples and o ﬀers aﬁrst large-scale analysis of four aspects. These are: if and how digital startups apply Lean Startups Approaches (Research Question 1); the ensuing results(Research Question 2); the main advantages and --- be positioned in the debate on entrepreneurship as an operational and scienti ﬁc ap- proach to the behavioural theories of E ﬀectuation ( Sarasvathy, 2001 ) and Entrepreneurial Bricolage ( Baker and Nelson, 2005 ), within an Opportunity Creation setting ( Alvarez and Barney, 2007 ).These ﬁndings could help to properly address and amend the downsides of LSAs, encouraging digital startups to adopt this promising- but still scienti ﬁcally under-investigated - approach. 1.4. Structure This study is structured as follows. After this introduction ( Section 1),Section 2 contains the theoretical background in which the study is positioned (i.e. the discovery and creation theories of entrepreneurial opportunity and action, and Lean Startup Approaches); the study method is described in Section 3 , leading to the results given in Section 4. These results are discussed in Section 5, and the conclusions con- cerning the study's contribution are drawn in Section 6, together with its limitations and the avenues for future research. 2. Theoretical background2.1. Discovery and creation theories of entrepreneurial opportunity and action Entrepreneurship is commonly deﬁ ned as the act of discovering and pursuing pro ﬁtable opportunities ( Shane and Venkataraman, 2000); once such opportunities are spotted, the entrepreneur should move towards them, to build a new venture or startup around them. In this phase, entrepreneurs engage in “opportunity-seeking ”behaviour, sub- sequently followed by strategic or “advantage-seeking ”behaviour, in order to integrate the opportunity with competitive advantage ( Hitt et al., 2001 ;Ireland et al., 2003 ). While the literature shows consensus on the centrality of the con- cept of opportunity in entrepreneurship, di ﬀerent approaches emerge concerning the nature of these opportunities and the process throughwhich they become apparent. As Alvarez and Barney (2007) argue, two alternative theories of entrepreneurial action indicate that opportu-nities --- (2007) argue, two alternative theories of entrepreneurial action indicate that opportu-nities can be discovered or created. According to the discovery theory of entrepreneurial opportunity (e.g. Shane and Venkataraman, 2000 ), opportunities exist in- dependently of the entrepreneurs, who should nurture alertness(Kirzner, 1973 ), that is, the ability to become aware of opportunities and discover them before others. A discovery view of opportunitieshence advocates the use of data collection and analysis techniques and methods framed in a business plan ( Delmar and Shane, 2003 ), to make decisions in a risky context. The creation theory of entrepreneurial opportunity takes a di ﬀerent stance (Gartner, 1985 ;Weick, 1979). Starting from the assumption that opportunities are not objective phenomena formed by exogenous shocks and that they do not exist independently of entrepreneurs, the creation theory posits that opportunities are social constructs en- dogenously created by the actions, reactions and enactment of the en- trepreneurs' exploring ways in order to create value in an uncertain context (Alvarez and Barney, pp. 13 –15). With regards to enactment, the proceedings entail an iterative, inductive and incremental decision-making process, supported by heuristics and based on the notion of aﬀordable loss rather than expected return. Diﬀerent entrepreneurial opportunity theories and decision-making contexts led to the advancement of parallel approaches and logics be- hind the entrepreneurial action. Sarasvathy (2001) restates this ap- parent dichotomy in her study comparing traditional causation logicswith what she calls “eﬀectuation ”. While causation sees the future as a continuation of the past, and entrepreneurial actions as goal-orientedundertakings that strive to avoid potential contingencies through ac-curate predictions and careful planning, E ﬀectuation considers the fu- ture as shaped by entrepreneurs, who act on the basis of the means athand –rather than --- the fu- ture as shaped by entrepreneurs, who act on the basis of the means athand –rather than the goals –and plan for the unexpected, leveraging contingencies as they arise ( Yang et al., 2018 ). As in the case of Eﬀ ectuation logic, Entrepreneurial Bricolage ( Baker and Nelson, 2005 ) argues that entrepreneurs operate in a condition ofA. Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945– 960 946 --- extreme resource scarcity, and have, therefore, to “make do ”by com- bining the resources at hand and applying them to new problems and opportunities that arise. Making do hence implies making the most of limited resources, by engaging in experimentation, the early and fre- quent interaction with customers and subsequent iteration ( Fisher, 2012 ). Although the logics of Eﬀ ectuation and Entrepreneurial Bricolage can describe the actual behaviour of entrepreneurs involved in theprocess of creating and developing startups ( Fisher, 2012), little is still known concerning about how they can be placed in a systematic op-erational frame to enhance opportunity formation through the en- trepreneurs' enactment process. Although recent studies ( Frederiksen and Brem, 2017; Yang et al., 2018) have come up with the suggestion that Eﬀ ectuation could be put into practice through the Lean Startup (Ries, 2011 ), these contributions are still scattered and unconnected, and show either a largely conceptual stance, or some misconceptions about the di ﬀerent steps included in the Lean Startup and its precursor, Customer Development ( Blank, 2007). 2.2. Lean Startup Approaches The Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs), named originally by Ghezzi and Cavallo (2018) , include two main methods to develop startups, with enough similarities to couple them within the same framework: Customer Development ( Blank, 2007 ) and the Lean Startup ( Ries, 2011 ). Steve Blank (2007) was the pioneer of LSAs when he introduced the concept of “customer development ”and described the process that entrepreneurs should follow to test and re ﬁne their business hypotheses through customer interaction. In his seminal book “The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win ”, he argued that a startup is a temporary organization looking for a scalable andreplicable business model. Therefore, the primary aim of any startup should be to test whether the overarching hypotheses of its business --- received funding from formal investors –i.e. independent venture capital funds, corporate venture capital funds, government venture capital funds –and/or informal in- vestors –i.e. business angels, angel networks, crowdfunding platforms, family o ﬃces and venture incubators (e.g. see Bruton et al., 2010, 2015; Kerr et al., 2011 ) between 2012 and 2017. This database was set up within a broader research project and, since 2012, has been mappingItalian-funded digital startups by triangulating data from all actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem –e.g. formal and informal investors, incubators and accelerators, governmental institutions, startups asso-ciations and the startups themselves. Formal and informal investors mostly di ﬀered in terms of whether the organization backing them was structured or largely unstructured,as well as whether they used a systematic or unsystematic approach to carry out the startup's due diligence before making an investment (Drover et al., 2017 ). We decided to focus on funded startups and in- clude both sources of equity capital ﬁnancing because this meant that our study looked at high-quality startups that had passed either aTable 1 The business model canvas ( Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010 ).

Discussion This study examines how digital startups' adopt and implement Lean Startup Approaches, pointing to a number of opportunities and issues that could be addressed to enhance the value of LSAs for digital en- trepreneurship theory and practice. 5.1. Framing LSAs within entrepreneurship theory With its insights, this research indicated a number of contact points between LSAs and other theories that are worth discussing and clar- ifying. With regards to the theoretical foundations of the Lean Startup Approaches, the empirical ﬁndings of this study back the claims made in the few recent works that looked into the antecedents of LSAs(Contigiani and Levinthal, 2018; Frederiksen and Brem, 2017 ;Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2018; Yang et al., 2018 ). As shown in Table 3, our qua- litative research brought up nine themes that form the theoretical roots of LSA, namely: (i) Lean; (ii) Agile; (iii) New Product Development (NPD); (iv) Real Options; (v) Organizational Learning; (vi) Business Model Innovation (BMI); (vii) E ﬀectuation; (viii) Bricolage; and (ix) Opportunity Creation. From a comprehensive overview, LSAs can hence be framed in a theoretical model where these approaches stand at the crossroads of theabove research streams and disciplines ( Fig. 3). These streams are far from being stand-alone silos and some of their key elements often partlyoverlap, as our empirical research shows. While the LSAs' relationship with themes (i) to (vi) had already been discussed in the recent works mentioned previously, the ﬁndings of this study mostly contribute to the debate on the role of LSAs with reference to Eﬀ ectuation, Bricolage and the whole theory of Entrepreneurial Opportunity. When discussing Lean Startup Approaches, the interviews with our digital startup founders --- When discussing Lean Startup Approaches, the interviews with our digital startup founders largely revolved around their standpoint andreasoning, and their actions to interpret their own role of entrepreneurs in a resource-constrained and uncertain environment. With regards to the logic behind entrepreneurial behaviour, the entrepreneurs showed how adopting and implementing LSAs drove them to take an “eﬀectual ”(Sarasvathy, 2001 )o r “bricolage ”(Baker and Nelson, 2005) stance on many occasions, underscoring how theselogics are, in essence, connected to LSAs' main steps and constituting elements. Formulating hypotheses about the world's evolution and the star- tup's role in in ﬂuencing it is similar to the E ﬀectuation principle stating that the future is shaped by entrepreneurs, rather than being a mereconsequence of the past. Moreover, building a minimum viable product to experiment and test hypotheses on the market and argue for or against the viability of the startup's business model re ﬂects an e ﬀectual and bricolage-oriented logic, in the ways in which resources are perceived and used, goals areset and learning is achieved. Despite operating in a resource-constrained environment, en- trepreneurs can take full advantage of their extremely scarce resources by combining them originally into low-cost - yet highly informative - pretotypes of their value propositions –the MVPs –and then deploy them to test their BM assumptions. In addition, experimenting and testing e ﬃciently though iterations and short startup-customer loops that provide valuable feedback is alsoconsistent with Eﬀ ectuation and Bricolage, in terms of having the ﬂexibility to handle and even exploit unexpected contingent events and information brought up by the experiments. At this stage, the startup'sparamount objectives boil down to minimizing upfront investments during the initial learning phases, in line with the concept of a ﬀordable loss, while making do with limited bootstrapped resources ( --- in line with the concept of a ﬀordable loss, while making do with limited bootstrapped resources ( Baker  and Nelson, 2005 ;Fisher, 2012; Sarasvathy, 2001). This study hence empirically supports the conceptual claim that LSAs provide operational support to E ﬀectuation and Bricolage in a systematic and scienti ﬁc way, overcoming in this manner the heuristic approach to problem solving –based on intuition, unclear paths and somewhat casual attempts –that traditionally went hand-in-hand with these logics and, to some extent, limited their e ﬀective implementation. On a bigger picture, another insightful contribution emanating from this empirical research concerns the theory of entrepreneurial oppor- tunities implicitly embodied by LSAs. Assuming that there are two alternative theoretical settings where opportunities can be discovered or created, entrepreneurs using LSAs take up a creational stance towards entrepreneurial opportunities, since the strategic tasks for entrepreneurs in a creational setting are to ask customers the right questions, design new experiments, remain ﬂexible and learn ( Alvarez and Barney, 2007 ). Fig. 3. Antecedents and theoretical roots of the Lean Startup Approaches.A. Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945– 960 954 --- LSAs seem to implicitly address one of the research questions for creational theory anticipated by Alvarez and Barney (2007 –p. 22) : “How can entrepreneurs use incremental, iterative and inductive pro- cesses to make decisions? ”. This study provides empirical evidence to answer this creation theory question, claiming that LSAs are the op- erational, systematic and essentially scienti ﬁc processes that enable opportunity creation through enactment. Positioning the investigation of LSAs within the debate on oppor- tunity discovery vs creation helps to bring about empirical contribu-tions for advancing entrepreneurial opportunity theory. Alvarez and Barney (2007) present these two internally consistent theoretical perspectives on opportunities as dichotomous: while dis- covery theory assumes that the environment is risky and entrepreneurs recognize and exploit opportunities by means of risk-based decision- making tools, such as the business plan ( Delmar and Shane, 2003 ), creation theory considers the environment to be uncertain and statesthat entrepreneurs form opportunities through enactment based on al- ternative iterative and incremental processes –like LSAs, as this study contends. However, what we found empirically is that, although LSAslead entrepreneurs to adopt a creational and e ﬀectual approach, other actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem still expect them to follow alargely discovery and causation approach, at least in terms of the output they produce and present (once again, the business plan), since the latter approach is more closely aligned to and compliant with their traditional “due diligence ”process based on risk assessment and man- agement ( Drover et al., 2017 ). The digital entrepreneurs interviewed solved this contrast pragma- tically by, in essence, sequencing the creational and discovery processes and tools. They ﬁrst iterate and experiment through LSAs to create opportunities and generate data, information and knowledge; they thenfeed --- through LSAs to create opportunities and generate data, information and knowledge; they thenfeed such knowledge into a well-structured business plan, to discover opportunities for the scaling, market penetration and company building of their startups. The turning point for moving from a creational to adiscovery setting is achieving a “product-market ﬁt”, in other words, the alignment between the startup's validated business model and whatcustomers demand ( Blank, 2007 ;Blank and Dorf, 2012 ;Ries, 2011). Theﬁndings of this study suggest that, while LSAs fall into the domain of creation theory, their output –i.e. data, information and knowledge created with reference to an uncertain environment –could provide the basis for a discovery approach by being fruitfully used as input to a business plan –i.e. a collection of risk-based decision-making tools. As a result, these ﬁndings also o ﬀer an answer to the question of how uncertainty can be best converted into risk and managed by en-trepreneurs ( Frederiksen and Brem, 2017 ). LSAs' iterations, interactions and experiments can help in the transition from uncertainty, whereknowledge about opportunities is created, to risk, where knowledge is further elaborated to discover opportunities through planning. This is also in line with the assertion by Brinckmann et al. (2010) that en- trepreneurial planning must be appropriate to the circumstances. This contribution concerned with how entrepreneurial approaches, models and tools are connected, empirically bridges the two theories onentrepreneurial opportunities (creation and discovery), by positioning them within an “opportunity space ”that helps to explain the empirical ﬁndings emerging in the study ( Fig. 4). Theﬁrst wave of opportunities is created by entrepreneurs through an enactment process based on experimenting and iterating on thestartup's business model and its elements. The underlying cognitive logic driving opportunity creation in an uncertain environment is the --- The underlying cognitive logic driving opportunity creation in an uncertain environment is the same as that found in E ﬀectuation and Bricolage; and the operational decision-making tools to create opportunities systematically and sci-entiﬁcally is embodied in the Lean Startup Approaches. Iterations proceed in incremental loops until the product-market ﬁt is achieved, and the business model is proven to be viable, replicable and scalable ( Blank, 2013 ;Ries, 2011 ). At this time, the decision- making context is converted from uncertain to risky, setting the scenefor entrepreneurial cognition based on causation. Entrepreneurs can then discover a second wave of opportunities through planning, where the set of decision-making tools encompassed by the business plan are such that the expected returns and the probability distributions of such returns can be estimated. These, in turn, lead to di ﬀerent alternative scenarios and related plans. As the opportunity space helps to bridge the alternative approaches to entrepreneurial opportunities, cognitive logics and operational de-cision-making tools, it is useful to note that the gap between the op- portunities created and those discovered is not clear-cut –as indicated by the vertical dotted line in Fig. 4. Iteration and planning can some- times alternate or coexist in speci ﬁc stages of startup development, as the context changes from uncertain to risky and calls for di ﬀerent en- trepreneurial logics and tools. As Alvarez and Barney (2007 –p. 19) suggested, entrepreneurs are required to make decisions using context-appropriate tools, which will help them to form and exploit opportu- nities more e ﬀectively. Recognizing that entrepreneurial opportunities are, in essence, a doubleheader also helps to explain why both discovery and creationaltheories are internally consistent ( Alvarez and Barney, 2007 ). They are so because they can adequately depict a di ﬀerent evolutionary stage for the new venture within the opportunity --- can adequately depict a di ﬀerent evolutionary stage for the new venture within the opportunity space; and all the actions that determined the evolution of the startup could be attributed ex post to one or the other theory depending on the stage that the entrepreneur orthe external observer wishes to emphasize or can recollect. 5.2. Enhancing the practical adoption and implementation of LSAs The combined results of this mixed-methods study into digital startups helped us to make sense of the practice of adopting and im- plementing LSAs, and so provide practical guidelines that are backed by theory and can help digital entrepreneurs to set this LSA process into operation. The unexpected result indicating that digital entrepreneurs are only modestly satis ﬁed by the outcome of the LSA implementation shows that these approaches are still burdened by many limitations andneed to be amended. Aﬁrst guideline to direct the adoption and implementation process examines the kind of digital startups that are encouraged to adopt these approaches. Startups backed by informal investors or independent venture capitals bene ﬁt from LSA adoption, but not just them, as even CVC-backed startups ﬁnd Lean Startup and Customer Development useful for verifying and validating their business ideas –despite maybe already having a captive market for their products and services. With regards to the stage in the startup's development lifecycle when LSAs are used, although most startups implement LSAs in their early stage, the introduction of a continuous adoption cycle that takes into fair account the di ﬀerent goals and metrics at the various stages of startup development is bene ﬁcial in supporting iterations and validations, as Fig. 4. The entrepreneurial opportunity space.A. Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945– 960 955 --- and as the entity to which any pi- voting should apply. Moreover, and remarkably, informants often de- clared that testing on the startup's go-to-market strategy and its ex- ecution was even more important than validating the product itself. For digital entrepreneurs wishing to embark on LSAs, a major ta- keaway of this study is that a piecemeal approach, where founders cherry-pick concepts and models they like and ignore other parts, is fundamentally ﬂawed. Several founders used LSAs in a personalized, unsystematic and disconnected fashion, maybe due to poor training orto the heuristic intuitive approach they were accustomed to. They should, instead, have been fully committed to adopting the whole process: for entrepreneurs, LSAs are the means to go beyond mere heuristics and embrace a scienti ﬁc method towards entrepreneurial opportunity and action. The opposite of a piecemeal approach is what is needed, and rather than adopting bits and pieces, entrepreneurs should combine all of the LSAs' process with other tools, one of which is certainly the business plan. In line with existing studies that claim that the business plan plays an important role in linking entrepreneurship and strategic manage- ment ( Delmar and Shane, 2003; Kraus and Kauranen, 2009 ), and building on our discussion on the entrepreneurial opportunity space,our argument is that Blank's (2007) famous motto “instead of writing an intricate business plan, design a business model [and apply customerdevelopment] ”should be altered to “before writing a business plan […]”. LSA experiments and tests, together with their real-world results and metrics, should be used as input to the planning operations in a well-structured business plan that can be easily assessed by both formal and informal investors. As a concluding remark, this research shows that digital en- trepreneurs sometimes blame LSAs for pitfalls that fall outside the do- main and scope of these approaches, and instead relate largely to the --- that fall outside the do- main and scope of these approaches, and instead relate largely to the process of formulating an overall business strategy, which startups tend to overlook. Reﬂ ecting on the startup's vision and mission, and strate- gically analyzing its internal and external environment, can better in-form the way entrepreneurs formulate their falsi ﬁable hypotheses and design their preliminary business model. Table 8 contains practical guidelines that entrepreneurs will ﬁnd useful to follow when adopting and implementing LSAs. 6. Conclusions This study presented a ﬁrst large scale research into if and how digital startups adopt and implement Lean Startups Approaches. The ﬁndings emerge from a mixed-method combining quantitative and qualitative analyses, and the contributions are relevant for both thetheory and practice of entrepreneurship. In terms of value for theory, the empirical evidence shows that the entrepreneurs' behaviour when applying LSAs mirrors that described in the theories of Eﬀ ectuation and Entrepreneurial Bricolage. Looking atA. Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945– 960 956 --- the bigger picture, the ﬁndings support the claim that LSAs are a set of operational, systematic and scienti ﬁc decision-making tools for sup- porting entrepreneurial opportunity creation: entrepreneurs use LSAs to make sense of the opportunities they create, rather than to discover and plan around them. Empirical evidence, however, shows that entrepreneurs solve the creation vs discovery dichotomy pragmatically by sequencing their use of LSAs and business planning. This suggests that there is an “oppor- tunity space ”that can bridge the various alternative theoretical views on entrepreneurial actions, cognitive logics, decision-making contexts and decision-making processes and tools. In terms of value for practice, this study can provide a set of guidelines and real-world insights into the adoption and implementa- tion of LSAs, and this can extend the anecdotal evidence currently available about common practice among digital entrepreneurs, while suggesting a move towards combining these approaches with other agile, entrepreneurial and strategic models.This study's limitations mostly refer to the following: sampling bias –i.e. focus on a speci ﬁc country and on funded digital startups –which could have in ﬂuenced the statistical and theoretical samples selected; and observer bias ( Yin, 1984 ), which could have distorted the inter- viewees' perception of the interviewer's questions, and/or the inter- viewer's interpretation of the interviewees' answers. While the sound research design may have helped to amend these limitations, future studies could explore di ﬀerent samples of startups - e.g. non-digital startups, or non-funded ones –and other countries, while investigating how to combine Lean Startup Approaches systematically with the other theoretical and practical streams indicated in this study.

Approaches (Research Question 1); the ensuing results(Research Question 2); the main advantages and disadvantages they feel come from the adoption and implementation of LSAs (Research Question 3); and how digital startups connect and combine the LSAs with other entrepreneurial approaches and tools for launching startups (Research Question 4). Using a mixed methods approach, the study builds on the results of a survey on 227 digital startups launched between 2012 and 2017 contained in an original database; it further informs these results through a qualitative research method based on 32 semi-structured interviews, to disclose additional insights. 1.3. Contribution According to the study's ﬁndings, Lean Startup Approaches are largely adopted in the sample of digital startups investigated, and di- gital entrepreneurs gain signi ﬁcant bene ﬁts from their implementation, mostly referring to the following aspects: (i) reducing time and costs totest the startup; (iii) aligning business idea to customer needs; (iii) verifying and pivoting all business model parameters; (iv) receiving rounds of ﬁnancing; and (v) o ﬀering alternatives to traditional in- tellectual property protection. When setting up their digital startups,however, the entrepreneurs found that the work to implement LSAs was not as straightforward as they had expected, having often under- estimated the true complexity of putting in place the relative processes and tools. More speci ﬁcally, digital entrepreneurs claim that they en- counter issues concerning: (i) deﬁ ning and designing MVPs; (ii) iden- tifying and engaging earlyvangelists and trial users; (iii) de ﬁning  testing priorities and designing experiments and tests; (iv) missing othermarket opportunities and threats; and (v) obtaining information aboutthe startup's sources of competitive advantage. As a conclusion, this study suggests that LSAs could be positioned in the debate on entrepreneurship as an operational and scienti ﬁc ap- proach to the --- similarities and partial overlapping, introducing the notion of LSAs.They relate LSAs to Agile Development and Business Model Innovation, although any detailed discussion of LSAs having roots in En- trepreneurship theory lay outside their scope and aim. Despite the growing interest in LSAs, extant studies still show only limited con- sensus about the origins of these approaches and their related tools; moreover, scholars often adopt a conceptual stance (e.g. Contigiani and Levinthal, 2018 ;Frederiksen and Brem, 2017 ) that needs to be backed by empirical investigation. 3. Methods This study is based on a mixed-method approach where quantitative and qualitative studies follow one from the other ( Castro et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2007). In mixed-methods research, qualitative methods are often employed to help explain and expand quantitative ﬁndings (Creswell and Clark, 2011 ;Molina-Azorin, 2012 ). More speci ﬁcally, this study uses a sequential approach by com- bining a quantitative questionnaire-based survey on a sample of digitalstartups (step 1) with qualitative semi-structured interviews on a sub- sample of digital startups representing polar or highly relevant cases – identiﬁed by their answers to the questionnaire (step 2). 3.1. Survey on digital startups In the quantitative step of this research, our aim was to collect large- scale information to address the following broad research questions: if and how do digital startups apply Lean Startups Approaches (RQ1); what are the results obtained (RQ2); what do they perceive to be the main advantages and disadvantages stemming from the adoption and implementation of LSAs (RQ3); and how do digital startups use the LSA in conjunction with other entrepreneurial approaches and tools for launching startups (RQ4). The sample was obtained from an original database of digital startups based and operating in Italy that received funding from formal investors –i.e. independent venture capital funds, corporate venture --- formal or an informal due diligence process, allowing us also to po- tentially contrast and compare the di ﬀerent roles that LSAs play in enabling or hindering the funding process. The original database, as of January 10th 2017 (when the survey was launched), held 484 digital startups that were still active and wereor had been funded by formal and/or informal investors. To collect data, an e-mail based survey was sent to the personal or business e-mail addresses of a representative digital startup founder, which had previously been collected and archived in the original da- tabase, together with information about the contact person in the founding team to be interviewed for research purposes. It was im- portant to interview the startups' founders since they were the people behind the business ideas to which the LSAs were being applied, and they had control over the development processes enabled by LSAs. A pilot survey was submitted to three digital startup founders who were willing to provide feedback on its structure and the clarity of the questions. This kind of feedback allowed us to revise the order of our questions and the wording of some of them, as well as tweaking the list of items to be included as alternative options, to come up with the ﬁnal version of the survey. Thisﬁnal survey was broken into four sections of questions covering the adoption of LSAs, the results, the advantages and disadvantages,and their integration with other entrepreneurial theories, approaches and tools. The full list of survey questions is given in Appendix 1. Where the answers to the questions were not of a Boolean yes/no type or chosen from a set of items, they were given on a four-point Likert scale, where the mid-points choices were eliminated in order to polarize results and help us to select the startups best suited to a qua- litative interview ( Garland, 1991 ). The initial personalized contact and subsequent telephone follow- ups ran up to March 15th 2017 ( Baruch and --- personalized contact and subsequent telephone follow- ups ran up to March 15th 2017 ( Baruch and Holtom, 2008; Porter and Whitcomb, 2003 ), at which point we had received 235 answers, giving a survey response rate of 48.55%. After cleaning this list by removingincomplete answers, the remaining 227 complete records was used as the basis for our quantitative data analysis. The respondents belonged to various ﬁelds of application in the broad digital industry, which also spans a number of traditional mar- kets ( Bharadwaj et al., 2013 ), and the sample was well-representative of the database's whole population in terms of industry and averagestartup age. Table 2 shows the distribution of the sample across dif- ferent ﬁelds of application. Given the rather explorative nature of this ﬁrst analysis on a wide sample of digital startups engaged in LSA practices ( Eisenhardt, 1989 ), the data analysis mostly relied on descriptive statistics to show the aggregations, means and trends that could be further explored through qualitative analysis. On this point, quantitative analysis provides the means to inform theoretical sampling in qualitative analysis ( Creswelland Clark, 2011 ;Molina-Azorin, 2012): as such, by leveraging on the contribution by Johnson et al. (2007) on the qualitative-quantitative continuum, this mixed methods research can be de ﬁned as “qualitative dominant ”. 3.2. Interviews with signi ﬁcant digital startups The qualitative step of the research consisted in gathering insights that could help to explain and expand the ﬁndings gained from RQs 1, 2 and 3, while further exploring how to address RQ4, which covered the LSAs and how they connected with other entrepreneurial approaches and tools. This step was designed as a set of semi-structured qualitative in- terviews ( Eisenhardt, 1989 ;Eisenhardt  and Graebner, 2007 ;Yin, 1984), starting from a protocol of questions similar to those of the survey (seeAppendix 2), although these questions were more --- of questions similar to those of the survey (seeAppendix 2), although these questions were more explorative and open to the informants going o ﬀtopic or including any new aspects, thus allowing innovative issues to emerge from the open discussion(Walsham, 1995 ;Yin, 1984 ). Case sampling was performed theoretically ( Eisenhardt, 1989; Meredith, 1998 ) and was informed by the outcome of the quantitative research step. The cases were selected according to their heterogeneityin terms of: (i) within-case consistency or inconsistency of answers to the survey; and (ii) cross-case polarities and signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences. By carrying out multiple qualitative interviews, it was possible to generalize the results more ﬁrmly ( Meredith, 1998) and undertake a comparative analysis of the ﬁndings, because the theoretical sample potentially contained extreme cases, polar types or niche situations(Meredith, 1998 ). Hence, in order to include the digital startups and associated informants in the qualitative research, they needed to show ahigh level of consistency or inconsistency in terms of their internal positioning towards the adoption of LSAs, or strong similarities or dif- ferences when compared to other startups. The face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were, therefore, the primary source of information when collecting data in this research step. Between May and October 2017, 51 digital startups which had answered the questionnaire were contacted to ask for a follow-up in- terview. Of them, 37 startups agreed, and 32 of them were eventually interviewed (14% of the sample of respondents, and 62.7% of the subsample of startups contacted in the qualitative research step). The interviews were held in a semi-structured format with the di- gital startups' founders and lasted on average 1 h and 8 min. For the data analysis, the interviewees' responses were ﬁrst recorded and fully transcribed. If any information was still unclear and/or more data was needed, the informants were --- transcribed. If any information was still unclear and/or more data was needed, the informants were later contacted by telephone to ask for clariﬁ cation. Then, following the recommendations set by Eisenhardt (1989) ,a within-case data analysis was carried out, so as to generate the neces- sary insight into the issues under scrutiny. A subsequent cross-case analysis made it possible to compare the various responses from in- formants belonging to the di ﬀerent digital startups. Interview content analysis was performed for both the within-case and the cross-case analyses, borrowing the use of open coding from Grounded Theory methodology ( Glaser and Strauss, 1967 ;Strauss and Corbin, 1998), as this method is suitable for studying complex phe-nomena as it applies a clearly de ﬁned procedure based on coding –i.e. using labels, concepts and words to produce theory from interviews,rather than the mere ﬁnding of facts ( Glaser and Strauss, 1967 ). The empirical material was codi ﬁed through textual analysis, and stored in a software archive. In accordance with Eisenhardt (1989) , as virtually no research can be based on a completely “clean theoretical slate ”(p. 536), coding was guided by the few extant studies where there was the explicit attempt to frame LSAs in theory ( Contigiani and Levinthal, 2018; Frederiksen and Brem, 2017 ;Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2018 ;Yang et al., 2018 ). The litera- ture streams seen as plausible antecedents or theoretical roots for LSAsTable 2 Sample characteristics.

Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change --- were used as the lenses through which to interpret the empirical results of the interviews. “In vivo ”and constructed codes were collected for each interview (Glaser and Strauss, 1967 ), recording the exact wording used by in- formants to describe the processes for adopting and implementing LSAs,as well as the constructed wording introduced by the researcher. By contrasting and comparing the content of di ﬀerent interviews itera- tively, we were able to identify any idiosyncratic positions as well as theaggregated clusters of concepts ( Clark et al., 2010 ), and these helped us to deepen our understanding and gain further insight into the quanti-tative research results. The results of the coding process, which consists of identifying a selection of codes and concepts and the broader themes derived from them, are given in Table 3. Beyond the themes determined straightforwardly through the various sections of the questionnaire – i.e. LSA adoption, results, advantages and disadvantages, com- plementary entrepreneurial methods and tools (not shown in Table 3) – other themes connected with Entrepreneurship, Strategic Managementand Innovation Management research emerged from the interviews.These themes are further elaborated in Section 5 –Discussion. To conclude, the interviews' results were reviewed and con ﬁrmed by the interviewees, to correct any potential errors or bias and ulti- mately enhance the correctness of our interpretations. 4. Results The results from our mixed-methods research are presented as a combination of quantitative ﬁndings derived from the survey on digital startups and the qualitative ﬁndings derived from the semi-structured interviews conducted on a subsample of the survey's respondents. The results are aggregated around the four broad research questions addressed in this study.4.1. Lean Startup Approaches - adoption The results concerning RQ1 about LSA adoption are given in Table 4 below. With regards to whether digital startups had adopted Lean --- LSA adoption are given in Table 4 below. With regards to whether digital startups had adopted Lean Startup Approaches, a striking 93% of the sample of founders declared that they had explicitly adopted and implemented LSAs with the purpose of driving the launch and development of their startup. Startups where these approaches have been adopted do so mostly to achieve a fast product-market ﬁt: they are well-aware of the need to run experiments on their original version of the business model and toverify whether their business model is aligned to the market's needs;alternatively, it could even drive or cater to new latent needs. The founders also know that timing and speed are instrumental in achieving and sustaining competitive advantage in such a crowded and dynamic environment as that of digital industries. As the founder and CEO of a mobile applications startup put it: “All of our apps look great to us and to our developers –because we came up withthem and sweated over them for months. So it's pretty obvious, isn't it? Whatis way less obvious is knowing if users are ultimately going to like them as much as we do and we need to test that out ”. Another founder and marketing president of an Internet of Things startup said that “[…] there's no such thing as a good idea if there's no market for it: we need to ﬁnd out whether there is a market out there or not ASAP and lean startup is just what I need ”. The founders of digital startups also rely on LSA to address another traditional critical issued faced by any startup: resource scarcity. The founder in a machine learning startup claimed that “LSAs give our team clear guidelines and a process to minimize the resources we need in theproduct-testing phase, which is what we need to burn less cash ”. LSAs are also seen as a way to put the complex and oftenTable 3 Codes, concepts and themes.

As a cloud computing startup's founder claimed: “our startup is a living organism in its early years …just like a baby. How can you sum up your early years with one word? I'd say: messy.Many things are going on, you want to be part of them all, and you still cannot ﬁgure out what to do or how to do it, and sometimes why you have to do it. Well, lean approaches tell you what should be done ﬁrst and what's next, while allowing you to keep your ﬂexibility. It's a kind of step-by-step ﬂow that allows iterations but helps you to put order into a messy en- vironment ”. A limited number of informants also declared that they had adopted LSAs to ﬁnd more recent alternatives to traditional business planning. In the words of the CEO of a mobile payment startup, LSAs were im-plemented “[…] in order to avoid mere desk research, as Blank said ”.O n this point, others also found that adopting LSAs was something in-vestors pushed and evaluated positively. The marketing manager in a mobile applications startup said that “when I and [co-founders] ﬁrst met a business angel, she asked: ‘Did you use lean startup approaches to see if your ideas make sense? ’. We said we hadn't, and she told us to come back after we had got some test results –which is what we did, and she became our ﬁrst investor ”. When it comes to the decision not to adopt LSAs, the main reason seems to be that the startup had apparently already achieved product- market ﬁt, so no other processes were required to verify this point. Interestingly, when these startups were analyzed in detail through thequalitative interviews, what emerged was that almost all of them had beenﬁnanced through Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) funds, with the mother company already providing a sort of “captive market ”for the startup to tap into. Their answer was hence probably unconsciously biased, as there was this pre-existing corporate-startup --- answer was hence probably unconsciously biased, as there was this pre-existing corporate-startup relationship, although the literature claims that even CVC-backed startups could probably bene ﬁt from the adoption of LSAs. The second reason was that startups perceived LSAs either as inapplicable to the startup's business idea and domain or too complex compared to traditional business planning. The founder of a big data startup said that “Lean Startup is cool but it's not for everyone: we sell business-to-business solutions, so who shouldour target evangelists be? Incumbent companies? How do you test on com- panies without jeopardizing your potential partnership with them? ”.A s another entrepreneur in arti ﬁcial intelligence put it: “Lean is only ap- parently simple, but if you go beneath the surface, there is a lot of com- plexity, mostly related to what an MVP is and who your trial users should be - and how do you even get in touch with them? ”. With regards to the LSA-related sources of information and training that the digital startups could draw on, most informants claimed that they practiced lean approaches when the startup was being incubated or accelerated. Di ﬀerent founders agreed with the CEO of a mobile application startup, who stated that: “A good 90% of our training sessions with tutors, coaches and mentors were actually about lean principles applied to our startups ”; and “here in [incubator's name], lean startup is every- where …you're literally ﬂooded with lean principles, there's no escaping from it! [Laughing] ”. Dedicated workshops were another major source for training, although their results often did not meet the startuppers' ex-pectations: the Chief of Operations in a social media startup claimed that “lean startup workshops, tutorial and training sessions spring up like mushrooms, but most are just [obscenity] and a total waste of time, so youneed to be very careful about who's running and holding them ”. In this adverse selection setting, --- to be very careful about who's running and holding them ”. In this adverse selection setting, bad choices are set to play an increasing rolein the adoption of LSAs, as more and more actors and institutions start holding courses and training sessions –sometimes apparently picking their stu ﬀout of thin air rather than having any real expertise. To solve this matter, many startups are turning to universities and university- based schools of management and/or entrepreneurship out ﬁts.“Lean Startup courses in a college are rather expensive, but they're becoming moreand more hands-on and practice-oriented rather than purely theoretical; so they're a good way to gain professional and certi ﬁed knowledge ”,a sa n Industry 4.0 founder and marketing manager said.Several entrepreneurs also declared that they learned about LSAs on their own by reading the books written by Blank (2007) ,Blank and Dorf (2012) andRies (2011) . A very small number of founders also declared that it was their investors who made the suggestion to adopt LSAs –and this largely overlaps with the informants who claimed that they hadadopted these tools to “please investors ”. Several insightful considerations emerge on the use of speci ﬁc LSA concepts, tools and models. The most widely used tool is the Business Model Canvas, whereby “[…] we easily make our business idea come down to earth ”–as the CEO of one eCommerce startup said –in a “uniﬁed, simple and straightforward way ”– according to the Chief Financial O ﬃcer in a security startup. In turn, the startups seemly adopt MVPs to outline the most important functions of their business idea and possibly enable the early interaction with customers. The whole build- measure-learn loop based on the MVP was also applied by startups striving to hear the “customers' own voices and opinions based on some- thing they touch and feel ”–as a founder of a startup in digital wearables said, and so prepare for pivoting. The least used concepts, according to the --- in digital wearables said, and so prepare for pivoting. The least used concepts, according to the quantitative analysis, were earlyvangelists and falsi ﬁable hy- potheses, and this ﬁnding relates to the disadvantages and criticalities that startups encounter when applying lean processes (see Section 4.3 ). Surprisingly, a few startups declared that they adopted all the models atthe same time, as if they somewhat personalized the LSAs during their implementation processes in line with the startups' speci ﬁc needs: “I found the [business model] canvas and MVPs quite useful, while frankly Inever used those falsi ﬁable hypotheses and evangelists …they sounded a bit tricky ”. Such cherry-picking and piecemeal approach may have sig- niﬁcant implications when assessing the LSA results and performance. The last point concerning the adoption of LSAs referred to the stage of startup development when the practices were leveraged. Here, many startups claimed they employed LSAs mainly in their early stage de- velopment, when getting their business model ready for the informal investors' approval; however, the founders also observed that adoptingLSAs could prove useful in later stage development, as “VCs look for indications about market traction, and lean startup approaches can showthem your traction ”–as a founder in a mobile services startup put it. It was apparently unusual to adopt LSAs at the seed stage, where thebusiness idea is at its embryonic stage of development, because, at that time, “the idea is too fuzzy even in your own head, you could probably sketch a canvas around it, but rather than embarking on a full lean startupor customer development process, you ask around for informal feedback, quizzing your network of peers, while you are asking them for pre-seed and seed money ”, as noted by an entrepreneur in a IoT-related startup. A number of startups also declared that they continuously used LSAs incycles and iterations, since, as a CEO in a mobile payment startup --- they continuously used LSAs incycles and iterations, since, as a CEO in a mobile payment startup said, “you really never stop pivoting and iterating a digital service ”. 4.2. Lean Startup Approaches - results Theﬁndings concerning RQ2 on LSA results and outcomes are given inTable 5 below. With regards to the duration of LSAs implementation, the founders declared that it took them an average of 8.2 months to go from the ﬁrst set of falsi ﬁable hypotheses embedded in a business model and a MVP, to achieving a reasonable product-market ﬁt that gave them the go- ahead to proceed with scaling –with a lower bound of 4.1 months and an upper bound of 13.5 months. During the interviews, it became clearthat changes to the LSAs' “lead time ”depended mainly on the following reasons: (i) ability or inability to ﬁnd team consensus about the right way to set hypotheses and design an initial business model; (ii) abilityor inability to craft the right MVP and to properly prioritize the MVP tests; and (iii) ability or inability to spot the right cluster of ear- lyvangelists or trial users, engage them and get informed feedback from them. The LSA length was clearly correlated to its cost –in terms of capital expenditure for equipment and, above all, operational ex-penditure in human resources, materials and advertising –such asA. Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945– 960 951 --- AdWord campaigns –both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the capital raised. The best performers in the sample, those keeping the LSA im- plementation length and cost to a minimum, felt that “the key here was to make all founders agree on one single statement that summarized our view on the startup and its best future ”–as stated by the CEO of a machine learning startup –while “cutting all features that were making our MVP too‘bulky ’and too similar to a real prototype, rather than a pretotype as it should be ”–in the words of an Industry 4.0 CFO. This was coupled with “a few weeks spent in ﬁnding where our target audience actually hung out, to target the right early users. It may have looked like time wasted, but as itturned out it clearly wasn't. It made us save a lot of time repeating tests in diﬀerent contexts and with di ﬀerent user groups ”. The low performers argued that their time and costs went out of control because of severalfactors, the most relevant being: “the inability to make plans about when to start and, most of all, end testing ”–as stated by the COO of an eCommerce platform startup; “our probably inaccurate de ﬁnition of the right metrics to use and the right prospective clients to include in the ex- periments caught us up in a never-ending iteration process ”–in the words of the CEO of an Internet of Things startup; and “our unwillingness to pivot was based on the sunk costs we had already incurred in device de- velopment ”–as the CEO of a digital wearables startup admitted. The last survey question on LSA results covered overall satisfaction. Surprisingly, although most digital startups by far said they used the approaches and that they saw something in return their implementation eﬀorts, the overall satisfaction hit a relatively poor 2.8 in a four-point Likert scale, leading to slightly less than moderate satisfaction. Thequalitative interviews revealed that behind this mild satisfaction was the fact that they recognized the --- interviews revealed that behind this mild satisfaction was the fact that they recognized the complexities and possible drawbacks of the approach (as discussed in Section 4.3 ), something that even the best performers experienced. “All in all, I enjoyed applying LSAs and I think they were bene ﬁcial for our startup in its early stages of development. Having said this, these apparently pragmatic tools sometimes work great intheory but not so well in practice, and did they make us sweat! ”, the founder and general manager of a big data startup said. This was reinforced inan interview with another founder of an Internet of Things startup, who stated that “lean startup tools, are, let's say, a great start …but they need a lot of work to de ﬁne, design and re ﬁne them before they're ready to tell you something you need to know about your company and its market ”. 4.3. Lean Startup Approaches - advantages and disadvantages Table 6 summarizes the main ﬁndings gained from RQ3 on the principle advantages and disadvantages of LSAs. With regards to the advantages of implementing LSAs, most digital startup informants claimed that these had helped “signiﬁcantly in cutting the time and costs we had expected for developing the startup, especially during testing ”–as stated by the CEO of a mobile applications startup. She continued by saying that “I have experience with previous startups where we didn't use startup and customer development, and I can say thatour savings here in time and costs are remarkable. Of course, this happens ifyou learn to use the right tools properly ”. Discovering and validating the alignment between the startup's business model and the needs of itstarget market was also a key outcome stemming from the adoption and implementation of LSAs: “before we used LSAs, we really had no clue as to whether customers would actually like and be willing to buy our products.This changed radically after they sent us their feedback and we learnt from it”, as said by the --- changed radically after they sent us their feedback and we learnt from it”, as said by the founder of an Industry 4.0 startup. Another advantage felt by founders implementing LSAs was that of verifying and/or knowing when to pivot, all the business model canvas parameters, which is something that goes well beyond the bundle of products and services embedded in the value proposition. As the CEO of a cloud computing startup explained, “we thought that LSAs were meant to help us verify our value proposition, but we found that it's a good set oftools to test other parts of our business model, like its channels and its revenue model ”. The COO of a mobile applications startup added that, “by applying Lean Startup and Customer Development, not only did we pivot six of the nine parameters in our canvas, we also changed two of them so radically that our launched startup looked very little like our original idea ”. Interestingly, the founders also noted that adopting LSAs made it easier for them to receive rounds of funding from formal and informal investors alike. The CEO in an eCommerce startup explained that “the evidence, metrics and ﬁgures ﬁrst shown to business angels, and later to venture capitalists, were so real and backed by testing, that they certainly helped us to demonstrate our business potential and its growth traction ”. Another entrepreneur in a mobile applications startup said that “the tools and metrics championed in lean approaches, like cohort analysis, are something investors really like. If you use them, you are showing them you really know your stu ﬀ. That's when they start trusting you and probably think: ‘I could give this guy my money ’”. A last, yet insightful, hidden advantage of adopting and im- plementing LSAs concerns their ability to force entrepreneurs to rethinktraditional Intellectual Property (IP) protection logics. In the words ofthe CEO of a machine learning startup, “when I read the books, the ﬁrst thing I thought was ‘ok, nice, but --- “In line with the lean rationale, we interviewed customers as early as possible, usingan online survey to ask them about the features of the would-be product they liked the most. We also asked how much they were willing to pay for each feature. The results were rather disappointing: as they said they liked all the functions, we learnt nothing about customer preferences …and to compoundTable 5 Quantitative results on RQ2 –LSA results and outcomes.

Dissatis ﬁed–4. Fully satisﬁed)A. Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945– 960 952 --- as we had expected ”. In line with this sometimes limited commitment to adopting and implementing LSAs as a whole, the ﬁndings of both the survey and the interviews revealed a common misconception about lean approaches,their reach and their role in supporting startup development. The in- formants pointed out that the LSAs gave very little support in spotting industry-related opportunities and threats hidden in external trends or in the market's structural determinants; or they received poor indica- tions about the startup's sources of competitive advantage, and about whether such sources could actually help to beat the competition. Both of these arguments show that entrepreneurs may tend to have un-realistic expectations about lean approaches and overestimate their own ability to support startup development. In actual fact, analyzing the features of the external industry –alongside those of potential customers –as well as the startup's internal sources of di ﬀerentiation goes well beyond the scope of LSAs. This interesting ﬁnding also in- dicates that digital entrepreneurs must complement LSAs with supple-mentary strategy analysis models and an overall business strategy. 4.4. Lean Startup Approaches and other entrepreneurship methods and tools Theﬁndings that relate to RQ4 - how digital startups connect and combine the LSAs with other entrepreneurial tools for launching startups, as well as their overall business strategy –are given in Table 7. Aﬁrst, signi ﬁcantﬁnding emerged concerning the approach most widely used in conjunction with LSAs, with a striking 91% of the founders saying that they use Business Planning. This result may seem surprising, as Customer Development was proposed as an alternative to business plans, as the latter kept the startup's development too far re- moved from reality for too long ( Blank, 2007 ). Nearly all the startupsTable 6 Quantitative results on RQ3 –LSA advantages and disadvantages. Research item Results Main advantages of LSAs --- results on RQ3 –LSA advantages and disadvantages.

Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945– 960 953 --- declared, however, that they had solved this false dichotomy by fruit- fully integrating LSA-derived data into the ﬁrst versions of their busi- ness plan, thus combining a “get out of the building ”stance with a well- structured document describing their strategic, marketing, operational, economic- ﬁnancial, organizational and human resource-related plans (Delmar and Shane, 2003 ).“Lean startup testing data and metrics proved a useful input to our business plan, where data came from our experiments with customers rather than from secondary sources ”, claimed the mar- keting manager in a mobile applications startup. This arrangement alsohelped founders to raise capital, since “[…] angels ﬁrst, and VCs later, seemed to really appreciate the combination of real-world data from theLSAs and the traditional business plan structure ”. The informants also emphasized the fact that they could combine LSAs with Agile methods ( Beck et al., 2001 ;Nerur et al., 2005; Holmström et al., 2006 ;De Cesare et al., 2010 ;Cram and Newell, 2016 ), toﬁll some of the gaps in Lean Startup and Customer Devel- opment. More speci ﬁcally, the founders were keen to introduce methods such as SCRUM and sprints ( Schwaber and Sutherland, 2011 ), as well as Feature-Driven Development ( Abrahamsson, 2003 ). The COO in an Internet of Things startup said that “sprints gave us timelines for iteration cycles in the build-measure-learn loops ”, while another founder in a security startup observed that “Feature-Driven Development helped us to deﬁne the features to be embedded in the MVPs ”. Moreover, digital entrepreneurs appeared not to underestimate the role of the traditional Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats(SWOT) analysis ( Lorange, 1980) in feeding the LSAs: “Before you even start any lean development process, you should be well-aware of what isgoing on in your target market, its trends, opportunities and threats, as well as of what you can oﬀ er in that market, what really makes you di --- the internal and external contexts vary and can turn out to be uncertain, this being in line with Agile principles ( Beck et al., 2001). Not starting too late also helps startups to avoid those sunk costs that make it muchharder to pivot, as emerged from the qualitative interviews. Making bad choices in an adverse selection setting also appeared to play a role in hindering the adoption and implementation of LSAs (Jullien, 2000 ), caused at least in part by the digital startups' di ﬃculty inﬁnding the right suppliers providing courses and training, indicating that there is a strong case for properly assessing the quality of their suppliers before the training starts. This result shows that universities, colleges and research institutions will play a growing role in the digital startups' ecosystem, as the certi ﬁed means for obtaining LSA-related knowledge. To some extent, this ﬁnding also goes against some recent claims that entrepreneurship cannot be taught and a college degree does not really help people to become a startupper (e.g. see Forbes, 2012 ). As Frederiksen and Brem (2017) sharply pointed out, Eric Ries (author of The Lean Startup) has a degree himself, and his background more than likely informed his work in generating the Lean Startup. Another key suggestion for digital founders embarking on the pro- cess of LSA implementation is to place the right focus on phrasing fal- siﬁable hypotheses. These assumptions provide the basis for testing, since entrepreneurs should build their business model around them andtheir MVPs should stem from them. Assumptions were, however, too often taken for granted or deﬁ ned too broadly. Digital entrepreneurs have to realize that de ﬁning hypotheses is not a mere exercise, but acts as the operational trigger for the whole scienti ﬁc method behind LSAs. With regards to the work behind crafting the MVP, designing MVP- based experiments and running the build-measure-learn loop, several takeaways emerge from this study. --- Editors and the two anonymous Reviewers, who helped signi ﬁcantly to improve the contribution of this study as a result of the revision process.Table 8 Practical guidelines for LSA adoption and implementation. Issue Practical guidelines Type of digital startup All startups, including those that are CVC-backed, bene ﬁt from adopting and implementing LSAs. Stage of startup development Startups are to adopt LSAs in their early stages of development, while continuously implementing them following Agile principles whenever the context turns out to be uncertain. Bad choices concerning the provision of LSA-related knowledgeStartups are to carefully assess and select suppliers for LSAs courses and training sessions.Startups are to rely on certi ﬁed and experienced actors –e.g. universities, colleges and research institutions, top-ranked incubators and accelerators. Formulation of falsi ﬁable hypotheses Entrepreneurs must think carefully on how they can accurately formulate falsi ﬁable hypotheses about their startup's business model (a step they often neglect).Falsiﬁ able hypotheses constitute the operational trigger for the scienti ﬁc methods embedded in LSAs. Identiﬁcation of earlyvangelists Entrepreneurs are to properly evaluate who their earlyvangelists and trial users are and where they “hang out ”,i n order to target the right prospects and receive informed feedback.In B2B settings, evangelists are found among existing business customers by carefully assessing the customers' purchasing processes and identifying the key decision-makers. MVP design MVPs are artefacts with these key characteristics: they (i) resemble and embody the business idea; (ii) are actionable;(iii) are measurable through the MVP testing outcomes; and (iv) are less wasteful than prototypes. MVPs as paid-for products increase the amount of information they carry when tested upon.MVP design can leverage Feature Development Design (FDD) to provide guidelines on how to identify and --- Appendix 1.

the primary aim of any startup should be to test whether the overarching hypotheses of its business model are indeed veri ﬁed, thus making the BM scalable and replicable. Based on Karl Popper's concepts of conjectures and refutations (Popper, 2014), which form the core of epistemology, the customer development approach states that, rather than developing products orservices, startups should develop customers and, to do so, they must go through a process consisting of two steps and four sub-steps (see Fig. 1 ). Theﬁrst is the “search ”step, when startups need to ﬁnd “ear- lyvangelist ”, that is, early customers or trial users with speci ﬁc char- acteristics –i.e. they have a problem or need, they are aware of having a problem, they are actively looking for a solution, they have even tried to put together their own solution, and they have or can acquire the funds to buy a good solution once they ﬁnd it ( Blank, 2007). After the earlyvangelists have been discovered, the startups should work closelywith them to create iterative feedback cycles that allow new solutions to be tested and the business idea to be improved incrementally, so that it gains customer validation. Testing and the subsequent validation are based upon a set ofassumptions and/or hypotheses set by the startup to postulate how its business idea will work and create value for customers, how value will be delivered to these customers and how a share of such value will be captured to ensure the startup's sustainability. This means that the startup will need to design an overall business model, that is, an ar- chitecture of value ( Ghezzi et al., 2015; Rappa, 2001 ;Teece, 2010), around its idea. When testing out their business models, entrepreneurs should in- troduce what is known as the “business model canvas ”(Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010 ), according to which three pillars and nine para- meters are assigned to a business model, as shown in Table 1. During its search phase, Customer Development, --- assigned to a business model, as shown in Table 1. During its search phase, Customer Development, therefore, helps the startup to obtain early insights about its prospective customers. Atthis point, the startup must prove that there is a potential market for its products/services and verify that there are customers willing to acquire them. By introducing this approach, the startup can reduce the likelihood of it failing. This is because the initial business model and the as- sumptions on which it was based, which in the main stem from the entrepreneur's personal perception of reality, have been tested and possibly veri ﬁed in the ﬁeld through repeated interaction with potential customers, and the learning outcome derived from these tests comesfrom the real world –in line with the directive to “get out of the building ”advocated by Blank (2007) . The “execute ”phase follows the search phase. Once the business model and the customers are validated, the startup can create its marketdemand through investments in marketing and sales spending, and it can scale up its business by structuring its functional units and in- troducing customer development teams ( Blank and Dorf, 2012 ). The Lean Startup, a term coined by Eric Ries (2011) , revisits Cus- tomer Development and consists of a business approach where the aim is to change the way companies are built and new products are laun- ched. As with Customer Development, the formulation of falsi ﬁable hy- potheses plays a critical role in triggering the Lean Startup process. Thetwo key assumptions made by entrepreneurs are: (i) the value hy- pothesis –testing whether a product or service really delivers value to customers once they are using it; and (ii) the growth hypothesis – testing how new customers will discover a product or service ( Ries, 2011 ;Hartman, 2013 –p 6). The Lean Startup introduces two new concepts: Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) –artefacts used for the fast and quantitative market testing of a product or --- Viable Products (MVPs) –artefacts used for the fast and quantitative market testing of a product or product feature –and pivots, where certain BM elements are changed in response to failed hypotheses tests. Accordingto Ries, a MVP is “that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customerswith the least e ﬀort” or, in a simpler way, “the smallest thing you can build that lets you quickly make it around the build/measure/learnloop ”(Ries, 2011). Unlike other methods for managing early stage ventures, the Lean Startup Approach also balances the strong direction imposed by a founder's vision with the need for redirection following market feed- back ( Eisenmann et al., 2012), thereby introducing a third element. In addition, when Ries describes LSAs, a central part is given over to the Build-Measure-Learn feedback-loop, which in turn is inﬂ uenced by the Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA) loop developed by themilitary strategist John Boyd as a tool for winning battles. Behind the feedback loop is the idea that entrepreneurs should get their products into the hands of customers –in the form of a MVP –as fast as possible in order to test it out and receive feedback that can be used to reject orvalidate their assumptions. The goal of Lean Startup is to minimize the time spent going through the feedback loop, the implication being that the startups need to build faster, measure themselves faster and learn faster ( Ries, 2011 ). Experiments and tests within the loop can also be iterated, as startups should formulate and validate their problem hy-potheses, create and validate their solutions to this problem, and Fig. 1. Customer development ( Blank and Dorf, 2012 ).A. Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945– 960 947 --- conclude by validating the remaining elements of the business model built around the solution, as well as seeing how to scale it up and ac- quire customers ( Gustafsson and Qvillberg, 2012; Heiramo, 2013 ). Fig. 2 depicts the process faced by an entrepreneur when following the Lean Startup Approach. Customer Development –with speci ﬁc reference to its “search ” phase –and the Lean Startup together make up the Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs), used by entrepreneurs when validating their digitalstartup business model. Ries (2011) andBlank (2013) both concur that, while traditional methods for New Product Development largely fo-cused on testing products, services and value propositions ( Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995; Krishnan and Ulrich, 2001 ), LSAs should help to experiment on all elements of the startups' BM. Recent attempts were made to frame the Lean Startup and Customer Development in the academic literature, with somewhat unconnected or partly inconsistent results. Frederiksen and Brem (2017) were in- volved conceptually in looking for theories that possibly back the LeanStartup, while not addressing the advantages and disadvantages of applying the method. Yang et al. (2018) investigated the en- trepreneurial reasoning behind the Lean Startup –which they divide into the phases of search and execute –andﬁnd that search actions are associated to e ﬀectual logics, while execution actions are instead as- sociated to causation logics. Nevertheless, in their hypotheses, they appear to equate the Lean Startup with Customer Development, as search and execution are phases of the latter rather than the former. Contigiani and Levinthal (2018) carried out research into the Lean Startup's theoretical roots and antecedents, but largely without men-tioning entrepreneurial theories. Ghezzi and Cavallo (2018) discussed the Lean Startup and Customer Development jointly because of their similarities and partial overlapping, introducing the notion of LSAs.They relate LSAs to Agile --- a company establishes with speci ﬁc customer segments Channels Describes how a company reaches and communicates with its customer segments to deliver a value proposition Value formula Cost structure Describes all costs incurred to operate a business model Revenue stream Represents the cash that a company generates from each customer segment (costs must be subtracted from revenue to create earnings) Fig. 2. Lean startup process steps ( Eisenmann et al., 2012 ).A. Ghezzi Technological Foreca sting & Social Change 146 (2019) 945– 960 948 --- of a machine learning startup, “when I read the books, the ﬁrst thing I thought was ‘ok, nice, but once I launch my MVP and run experi- ments, aren't I putting my ideas out there for competitors to steal? ’Yet, as I deep- dived into the lean startup philosophy, I understood that being leandoesn't mean being dumb, and rather than IP protection, it's all about speed ”. Another COO in a mobile applications startup added the following: “If you go for build-measure-learn loops and experiments, it's key to being fast. You can't just run the experiments and sit there and wait: once you get the green light, you must be ready to pivot, develop and launch at full throttle. By then competitors know you're there, but you will still have the advantage by being ﬁrst in learning what counts for your customers, and can act fast accordingly ”. Coupled with IP protection, the informants also addressed the matter of reputational risk associated to poor MVPs. Our interview with the founder of a mobile application startup shed light on a view common among digital startups: “Of course launching a sloppy MVP on your market could harm your brand: that's why you should de ﬁnitely use ‘fake brands ’when doing your experiments. Prospective customers may get upset by the fake brands' products, but, at the end of the day, they will turnto your brand's ﬁnal product once it's been thoroughly LSA-tested and is ready ”. As anticipated in the previous sections, many insights were derived from the discussion of the main disadvantages of LSAs. By combiningquantitative and qualitative data and information, a clear and true picture emerges of the weaknesses in LSAs, and this could lead to im- proving these processes. First, many founders encountered severe problems when de ﬁning and designing their MVPs, and also when designing MVP-based tests. The founder of a mobile applications startup said the following: “In line with the lean rationale, we interviewed customers as early as possible, usingan online --- it, they were so unwilling to pay, there was no justi ﬁcation for our investment in any of these functions …practically speaking, that test was useless ”. This statement is revealing, as it shows how entrepreneurs still confuse MVP and MVP-based testing with marketing research: according to its ori- ginal proponents, MVP-based testing is not about market research, but is should enable the experimenting on customers' natural behaviour; tests should not refer to willingness to pay, but rather simulate an en- vironment where customers believe they are actually making a pur- chase ( Blank, 2007; Blank and Dorf, 2012; Ries, 2011 ;Ries and Euchner, 2013 ). Another entrepreneur in a social media startup complained that “In theﬁrst version of our MVP, we created a video showing how our application should work. That's something we learned from other popular lean startup cases, like Dropbox. However, beyond counting the number of times the video was watched, we learned little from the process ”. This statement shows that, when applying MVPs, it is crucial to create an MVP that isactionable, in the sense that it should trigger the customer's natural behaviour and actions that carry useful information and evidence forstartups –like registering to a beta waiting list, as in the case of Dropbox. A third point, stated by a founder in an IoT startup, showed how apparently di ﬃcult it can be to place MVPs within a business-to-busi- ness environment: “We serve companies with complex systems, so it's kind of hard for us to isolate key functions and test them on their own; whathappened when we applied the lean approach was that we ended up by creating a full prototype –and its budget was far from being cheap or lean…”. A concluding remark on MVPs from a COO in another Internet of Things startup is also worth mentioning: “Lean tells you to build a MVP, but gives you no clear guidelines or indications whatsoever on how to do so!”. Spotting earlyvangelists and trial users is another --- or indications whatsoever on how to do so!”. Spotting earlyvangelists and trial users is another excruciating dif- ﬁcult exercise for many startups. As a founder in a mobile applications startup noted: “We kept on asking ourselves ‘who, which customers, should we test our business model on? ’, but we never came to a de ﬁnite conclusion. We eventually launched our MVP after testing indiscriminately across ourtarget market, with mixed results ”. Another marketing manager in a machine learning startup highlighted a further issue relating to iden-tifying and engaging with trial users: “we identiﬁ ed our target segment and actively engaged with several in ﬂuential users, receiving interesting feedback from them. We then found another potential target segment, en- gaged with those users too, and received totally di ﬀerent feedback compared to the ﬁrst lot. What were we meant to do with all this assorted feedback? And how were we to know when to stop ?” Many of these drawbacks, which on the surface were connected to LSAs, stemmed from the fact that startups seldom see the need for setting assumptions and hypotheses about themselves, their market andtheir customers (this was highlighted in Section 4.1 , where we saw that, among the lean concepts, falsi ﬁable hypotheses were the least used). Hypotheses were often taken for granted, or de ﬁned too broadly. Somefounders did not address the most penetrating questions about their customers and what they want, their pains and gains ( Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010), which ultimately made it di ﬃcult for them to ﬁnd out who their earlyvangelist actually were. This emerged from the words of a CEO of a mobile payment startup, who admitted honestly that: “The problem was never the process. It was us. We never really accepted that wehad to fully adopt it in all its steps, with an open mind and true commitment: that's why it did not pay oﬀ as we had expected ”. In line with this sometimes limited commitment to adopting and implementing --- experiments and running the build-measure-learn loop, several takeaways emerge from this study. Startups should spend enough time in actually understanding who their target customers are, together with their pains, gains and needs ( Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010), and so properly identify the earlyvangelist and trial users able to provide in-formed feedback and stimulate useful learning. Once the earlyvangelists are identi ﬁed, the MVPs should be built and placed in their hands. This research highlights a signi ﬁcant dis- tinction that makes LSAs di ﬀerent from traditional approaches to startup development. MVPs are not related to marketing research, asinstead they should enable experiments on the customers' natural be- haviour. MVPs are artefacts that should have the following key char- acteristics: (i) resemble and embody the business idea; (ii) be action- able, as they should activate customer response and actions to learn from; (iii) be measurable through the MVP testing outcomes; and (iv) be less wasteful than prototypes. When possible, entrepreneurs are also encouraged to make the MVP a paid-for product rather than just a free version, to further qualify the input from early adopters who become paying customers ( Ries, 2011). This was seldom the case in the sample analyzed, thus impairing the measuring and learning stages of the loop. To design MVPs, our ﬁndings suggest that entrepreneurs can leverage Agile methods such as Feature Development Design(Abrahamsson, 2003 ) to provide guidelines on how to identify and design the minimum features and run iterations. In addition, when itcomes to running iterations, digital products and services could be run through Scrum sprint cycles ( Schwaber and Sutherland, 2011) to con- trol for time and budget. When the digital startup operates in a B2B context, our results suggest that these startups should ﬁnd their right evangelists among existing business customers by carefully assessing their customer com- panies' --- evangelists among existing business customers by carefully assessing their customer com- panies' purchasing processes –as decisions about buying into the star- tup's digital solution can come from di ﬀerent stakeholders. Additionally, MVPs in a B2B environment cannot be overly “minimum ”, in the sense that they should incorporate a su ﬃcient number of features at a satisfactory level to compete with existing o ﬀers. MVP-based testing should even lead digital founders to radically rethink their views on IP protection and their approach to launching the startup. Rather than ﬁghting to control, hide and defend their business idea, LSAs place signi ﬁcant emphasis on collaboration and openness,where the key to competitive advantage is not the original know-how,but the startup's learning speed. This point is inherited from an e ﬀec- tual-type logic, which favours partnership and cooperation rather thancompetition ( Sarasvathy, 2001 ;Yang et al., 2018 ). Insights were also derived from the span and width of the process of validating and, when appropriate, pivoting the business model. This research underscores how LSAs support innovation to the whole value architecture of the digital startup's business model, including value delivery and capture as well as value creation. Changes to such value parameters can be incremental or radical, resulting in slight modi ﬁca- tions or even dramatic changes to the original business idea. AlthoughRies and Blank themselves argue that the business model of a startup is up for experimenting on ( Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2018 ;Gustafsson and Qvillberg, 2012; Hartman, 2013 ;Heiramo, 2013 ), a common mis- understanding among entrepreneurs is to place the focus of LSAs on testing product features. Our ﬁndings strengthen the belief that digital entrepreneurs should, instead, take entire business models as their unitsof analysis for experiment purposes and as the entity to which any pi- voting should apply. Moreover, and remarkably, informants often --- design can leverage Feature Development Design (FDD) to provide guidelines on how to identify and designminimum features and run iterations. In B2B settings, an MVP cannot be too “minimum ”, as it should incorporate a su ﬃcient number of features at a satisfactory level to compete with existing o ﬀers. Experimenting and testing Experiments are to be MVP-based, which in turn means they are BM-based.Digital products and services can be run through Scrum sprint cycles, to control for time and budget.Entrepreneurs are to radically rethink their views on IP protection, embracing openness and collaboration through fast experimenting and learning. Business Model validation and pivoting Startups are to experiment and test on all elements of their business models, not just their value proposition (product, service, solution, bundle).Executing a go-to-market strategy often requires more testing than the value proposition itself. LSA broad adoption and implementation process Entrepreneurs are to adopt LSAs comprehensively, rather than cherry-picking the steps and elements they perceive asmost useful. Entrepreneurs are to go beyond heuristics and apply a scienti ﬁc method by means of the LSAs.Entrepreneurs are to integrate LSAs with business planning, thus altering Blank's motto to: “before writing a business plan, design a business model and apply LSAs ”.Entrepreneurs are not to overlook the process of strategy formulation and strategy analysis which can inform theformulation of falsi ﬁable hypotheses and design of a preliminary business model.A.
