According to [2 ], business model is not simply the means by which a firm creates and captures customer value.  It requires vigilance and must be adapted and strengthened over time as the competitive environment evolves.    This competitive environment demands great corporate effort towards innovation models. Innovation was defined  by [3] as “the creation of a new product -market- technology -organization- combination”. [4] defined innovation as the  ability to develop existing knowledge and enhance new knowledge. Includes the company's ability to develop novel  products and any innovative ideas.   It is not surprising, therefore, that a stream of research relates Business Model  Innovation (BMI) to organizational change processes. BMI is not only becoming more and more important due to  increasing and globalizing competition, but also an enormous ch allenge, both theoretically and practically.    At root, BMI refers to the search for new logics of the firm and new ways to create and capture value for its  stakeholders. It focuses on finding new ways to generate revenues and define value propositions for  customers,  suppliers and partners [5]. BMI has recently aroused important academic researches and business practices  and t he  recognition of changes due to business models is a fundamental approach to realize innovations for sustainability.  The  ability to innovate in the domain of sustainability represents a necessary business capability, whether related to small  incremental steps or to radical. BMI is emerging as a potential mechanism to integrat e sustainability into business [6],  [7]. The academic and pra ctitioner interest in sustainable business models has grown rapidly. As mentioned by [8], [9]  and [10], when the concept was first conceived, its main purpose was to put
mentioned by [8], [9]  and [10], when the concept was first conceived, its main purpose was to put companies into the service of the  transformation to a more sustainable economic system  and to provide leverage for integrating sustainability  considerations into organizations and helping companies to achieve their sustainability ambitions.    It is rather common in literature to see sustainable business models as a modification of the conve ntional business  model concept, that incorporate either concepts, principles, or goals that aim at sustainability, or integrate sustainability  into their value proposition, value creation and delivery activities, and /  or value capture mechanisms. Accordin g to  [11], [12], [13], [14] and [15], it implies a process of continually business model exploration, adjustment,  improvement, redesign, revision, creation, development, adoption, and transformation. Targeting cost reduction,  process optimization, introduction of new products, accession to new markets, and, of course, ultimately financial performance improvement.   Lean is a way of thinking and acting for an entire organization, and not merely a tact ic or a cost reduction program  [16]. [17] adapted the lean principles to the entrepreneurial strategy area by elaborating the lean startup process.  Considered practitioners, [18] have given substantial contributions to the recently introduced lean startup methodology  [17]. It rejects long- term planning and embrace s experimentation and iterative learning. Attracting much attention  from entrepreneurs, practitioners and academics [17] and [19].  The aim of this paper is to develop a unified theoretical perspective for understanding Business Model Innovations  and Lean S tartup Process, that lead those recently started firms to better organizational, economic, environmental and  social performance.

as follows: on this introduction a contextualization was made, also was  presented the objective of thi s article. On Section 2 will be presented the method used on this work. On Section 3 the  most important concepts regarding the objective will be presented. On Section 4 will be presented the correlation found between the author regarding the BMI and Lean S tartup Process. Following, will be presented the final  considerations and the references used on the article.      2. Methodology  The development of this article is based in an exploratory and descriptive research on the data published on BMI  and Lean Startup,  to contextualize and define the BMI and Lean Startup methodologies, both in a qualitative way.  According to [20], an exploratory research helps understanding the context of an unfamiliar area or situation and the  descriptive approach can explore a correla tion between subjects. Our study at hand draws especially attention to  startups by exploring factors that influence BMI in the pivoting process. This paper explores how the BMI  methodology and the lean startup methodology contribute to a prescriptive accel erator.     In order to assure that the references chosen are in accordance with the objective of this study, the authors decided  to use the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol, which is used to identify, evaluate and interpret all available research  relevant to a particular research question  [21]. The protocol consists in several activities, divided in three  stages: planning, conducting and reporting [21]. Table 1 describes the procedures adopted on this SLR.

Literature Review   In this literature review, we will present a review on the BMI theory and methodology.  It will be followed by an  overview of the lean startup methodology, as a powerful theory deeply influencing startup sustainability.   3.1. The Business Model Innovation (BMI)  and The Business Model Innovation methodology   As mentioned by [22], innovation is known to often strongly challenge organizational processes.  Therefore, it is  true that a stream of research relates BMI to organizational change processes. This stream emphasizes the capabilities,  leadership,  and learning mechanisms that are needed for successful BMI. Studies within this stream describe BMI as  a dynamic process by highlighting the differ ent stages of the BMI process [23], [24], [25] and [26]. They identify the  different organizational capabili ties and processes required to support this change process [27], [28] and [29], citing  the importance o f experimentation and learning [30], [31], [32], [33] and [34], and proposing practitioner -oriented
experimentation and learning [30], [31], [32], [33] and [34], and proposing practitioner -oriented  tools for managing the process [35] and [36].  The def inition and assessment of business models and their innovation process has become a topic of paramount  importance in the fields of strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship, and have become influential in macro  management research in recent years  [37] and [38]. The BMI involves innovation to at least one of the foundational  elements of value creation, delivery and capture, and thereby gives a firm the potential to activate overlooked value sources within the company or create new systems that are difficult to imitate [39]. [40] notes that BMI can be defined  as ‘the discovery of a fundamentally different business model in an existing business. [41] defines that “BMI is about  generating new sources of profit by finding novel value proposition/value constellati on combinations.” [42] believes  that the success of a business model should be measured considering the extent of the revenue generated by the new  model and how it helps the company in achieving a sustainable competitive position by creating and delivering  value  to its customers. Moreover, according to [43] BMI can help companies achieve triple -bottom  line results that is, social,  environmental, and financial goals.   As mentioned by [38], [44], [45] and [46] in general a considerable amount of effort has been observed by  researchers while exploring BMI and its methodology.  [13] describe numerous benefits of applying a BMI  methodology such as an increase in financial performance. Moreover,  [47] confirm ability  of BMI to strengthen a  firm's strategic position and [48] refers to BMI as a powerful tool to attract new customers.   A relevant change in Customer value proposition (CVP), profit formula (PF), key resources and processes (KR&P)  is stated by [39] and [46], as the result of BMI methodology, that has taken together, creation, deliver,
by [39] and [46], as the result of BMI methodology, that has taken together, creation, deliver, and capture  value. Perceiving usefulness for customers, identifying the manner incomes are generated and costs are structured and  describing the need of resources and processes , respectively.

Entrepreneurship and sustainability   Entrepreneurship is intrinsically linked to BMI: For start -ups, any act of entrepreneurship means the choice of a  BM, while in established firms the exercise of entrepreneurial judgment results in changes in the BM’s components  or architecture. According to  [49], BMI is tightly linked to the idea of entrepreneurial vision, imagination, and  judgment. Predominantly referring to BMI in the context of innovative start -ups. To be sustainable, a startup needs t o  grow. The business model needs to be designed in a way that the company can scale up quickly and maybe even go international. Besides growth, startups need capital and investors to sustain months or even years of non -profitability.  If the business model is no longer attractive to investors, startups will find it difficult to pitch for new money.   3.3. The lean startup and The lean startup methodology   The “Lean philosophy” and its principles originated in the manufacturing world after the end of the Second World   War, as a result of customers' needs evolving towards higher value in combination with companies' increasingly diverse offer  [50; 51].   According to [51], this significant redirection of production systems towards customer value refers to the concept  where value is created by a decrease of internal waste, reducing cost production, and by an increase of new services or function offer to the customer, enhancing profit. They also call the attention that the costs of every firm must be  transparent to all supply chain partners. Another major issue stated was the importance of flow creation, avoiding any  stoppage, such as changes in production, breakdowns, incorrect batches in terms of quantity or timing, lack of  necessary information and re -entrant l oops.  [17] made an attempt to
quantity or timing, lack of  necessary information and re -entrant l oops.  [17] made an attempt to adapt and combine the lean philosophy and its  principles to the startups' development area by elaborating the Lean Startup Methodology. In his 2011 New York Times bestseller “The Lean Startup”, [17] introduces the term “pivot”  in the context of business models to the academic  world. It centers on the question whether a startup should decide to pivot or to persevere. He defines a pivot as a major  change, a structured course correction “designed to test a new fundamental hypothes is about the product, business  model, and engine of growth”. According to him, pivoting, refers to major changes and course corrections instead of incremental adjustments and can be viewed as a concept of BMI.   Inspired by the lean manufacturing principles  (avoiding waste and optimizing resource spending) and [52] ideas,  [17] introduced the lean startup methodology, defined as the startup's attempt to cut its own waste, understood as all  the activities and processes which the target customer do es not want o r does not ask for . In his 2011 New York Times  bestseller “The Lean Startup”,  the term “pivot” is introduced in the context of business m odels to the academic world,  centering on the question whether a startup should decide to pivot or to persevere. According to [17], pivoting, refers  to major changes and course corrections instead of incremental adjustments and can be viewed as a concept of BMI.   The Lean Startup Methodology consists of a scientific, hypothesis -driven ap proach to entrepreneurship, where  entrepreneurs translate their vision (i.e. business idea) into falsifiable hypotheses which are embedded in a first version  of a business model. These hypotheses are then tested through a series of minimum viable products (MVPs). [19]  define the MVP as “the smallest set of activities needed to disprove a hypothesis”. The process is iterated until all key  hypotheses
of activities needed to disprove a hypothesis”. The process is iterated until all key  hypotheses are confirmed or validated through MVP tests. When this condition is reached, the startup has achieved its  “product -market fit” [19], which means that the value proposition designed and iteratively revised by the startup  actually satisfies the needs of its target customers. According to  [18], this fit hence represents the successful conclusion  of the “build -measure -learn” loop, where the startup builds an MVP and associated tests, measures the test results and  customer feedback and learns how to change its business idea and business model accordingly. The ultimate goal of  the methodology is to guide entrepreneurs i n finding this fit.   It engages entrepreneur into process designing to test the assumptions that constitute the business model [17], and  creating a “minimum viable product” (MVP). Through rigorous evaluation of the results, the invalidated assumptions are replaced and new assumptions are tested. This process continues until a reasonable number of tests point to the  validation of critical assumptions. Finally, when all the remaining assumptions are validated, “product -market fit” is  achieved [17].

Discussio n  Throughout our review, our qualitative research on the data published on BMI and Lean Startup, led us to consider  eight  articles, which  were  identified as important documents to explain and address the contribution of BMI and Lean  Startup Methodologies i n startup´s sustainability.

also  observed by [38] when they stated that there is an increasing consensus that  BMI is key to firm performance. Those  ideas were apparently confirmed by [43]. They concluded that BMI may provide mechanisms to assist the innovation  process for embedding sustainability. Correlating the researches done by [27] and [39], we can identify that more and  more companies now are turning toward  BMI business model innovat ion as an alternative to product or process  innovation. As well as cost and waste reduction via a prototyping process. [27] considered BMI to be a great tool to  experimentation that can lead to through trial -and-error learning.   A focus on the sustained val ue creation was presented by [27] as guideline for companies which manage to  successfully adapt and renew their business models over time. Statement that was also noted on the research placed  by [39] that presented an inductive theory on the sources of val ue creation, showing how value- creation enhances the  potential of a business model. [43] demonstrated possibilities for sustainable business models and how to translate  social and environmental value creation into economic profit and competitive advantage for the firm. Discussing the  main purpose of a business model and why the business model concept is offered, [38] defined the value creation  mechanism as competitive advantage and strategic to understand new networked modes of innovation.  [19] concluded  that the lean startup is a business model that allows new ventures unique value creation and sustainable profits.  Researching the  BMI in digital entrepreneurship,  [53] also identified the importance of value creation to startup´s early  stages of development.   Finally, [19] affirmed that the lean startup methodology unlike other methods, balances the strong direction that  comes from a founder’s vision with the need for redirection that follows from market feedback, corroborating with the  strategic perspective of this business
that follows from market feedback, corroborating with the  strategic perspective of this business model. While investigating digital startups in the early stages , [53] concluded  throughout the data collection and analysis steps, that BMI and Lean Startup are related. The Lean Startup methodology can be perceived as a strategic business model, and as concluded by  [16], may play a significant role in  advancing the BM research in its theory and operative tools.

Conclusion   This study investigated the relation amongst BMI and Lean Startup and how they may contribute to deliver  sustainability  to startups. Our work provides value for theory by combining and connecting author´s lines of works  towards a sustainable value creation for those new enterprises.   The mainstream of a business model is that it hardens customer needs, defining how the bus iness enterprise delivers  value to customers, attract customers to pay for value, and t ransform payments into profit. BMI Business model   innovation and lean startup methodologies are certainly built on these ideas, but especially  the lean startup approach  evaluates an early stage startup’s entire business model. It introduces the minimum viable products concept that  efficiently test business model hypotheses, and pivots that change certain business model elements in response to failed  hypothesis tests.   Ultimately, our study guided us to conclude those methodologies balance the strong direction that comes from a  founder’s vision with the need for redirection that follows from market feedback. The key conclusion of our analysis  is that, to be a source of comp etitive advantage, a business model must be something more than just a good logical  way of doing business. A sustainable model must meet particular customer needs. It arouses the need of innovative forms to approach customers and it certainly guides enterprises’ value capture strategies to achieve superior results.   Overall, we conclude that advancing the understanding of startup´s business sustainability is a relevant top ic. More  research remains to be done to validate our conclusion and to advance the cur rent understanding of the startup  environment.   6. Limitations and future research   Further research can mend this study’s
startup  environment.   6. Limitations and future research   Further research can mend this study’s limitations, related to the lack of reliable sources of literature that validates  a strong correlation among those variables. Moreover, we  recognize that quantitative studies may also be necessary to  confirm our qualitative analysis.   The resulting value for practice takes the form of identifying the core elements that startups should consider  carefully while building their business model.    References  [1] Teece, D. J.

According to [2 ], business model is not simply the means by which a firm creates and captures customer value.  It requires vigilance and must be adapted and strengthened over time as the competitive environment evolves.    This competitive environment demands great corporate effort towards innovation models. Innovation was defined  by [3] as “the creation of a new product -market- technology -organization- combination”. [4] defined innovation as the  ability to develop existing knowledge and enhance new knowledge. Includes the company's ability to develop novel  products and any innovative ideas.   It is not surprising, therefore, that a stream of research relates Business Model  Innovation (BMI) to organizational change processes. BMI is not only becoming more and more important due to  increasing and globalizing competition, but also an enormous ch allenge, both theoretically and practically.    At root, BMI refers to the search for new logics of the firm and new ways to create and capture value for its  stakeholders. It focuses on finding new ways to generate revenues and define value propositions for  customers,  suppliers and partners [5]. BMI has recently aroused important academic researches and business practices  and t he  recognition of changes due to business models is a fundamental approach to realize innovations for sustainability.  The  ability to innovate in the domain of sustainability represents a necessary business capability, whether related to small  incremental steps or to radical. BMI is emerging as a potential mechanism to integrat e sustainability into business [6],  [7]. The academic and pra ctitioner interest in sustainable business models has grown rapidly. As mentioned by [8], [9]  and [10], when the concept was first conceived, its main purpose was to put --- experimentation and learning [30], [31], [32], [33] and [34], and proposing practitioner -oriented  tools for managing the process [35] and [36].  The def inition and assessment of business models and their innovation process has become a topic of paramount  importance in the fields of strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship, and have become influential in macro  management research in recent years  [37] and [38]. The BMI involves innovation to at least one of the foundational  elements of value creation, delivery and capture, and thereby gives a firm the potential to activate overlooked value sources within the company or create new systems that are difficult to imitate [39]. [40] notes that BMI can be defined  as ‘the discovery of a fundamentally different business model in an existing business. [41] defines that “BMI is about  generating new sources of profit by finding novel value proposition/value constellati on combinations.” [42] believes  that the success of a business model should be measured considering the extent of the revenue generated by the new  model and how it helps the company in achieving a sustainable competitive position by creating and delivering  value  to its customers. Moreover, according to [43] BMI can help companies achieve triple -bottom  line results that is, social,  environmental, and financial goals.   As mentioned by [38], [44], [45] and [46] in general a considerable amount of effort has been observed by  researchers while exploring BMI and its methodology.  [13] describe numerous benefits of applying a BMI  methodology such as an increase in financial performance. Moreover,  [47] confirm ability  of BMI to strengthen a  firm's strategic position and [48] refers to BMI as a powerful tool to attract new customers.   A relevant change in Customer value proposition (CVP), profit formula (PF), key resources and processes (KR&P)  is stated by [39] and [46], as the result of BMI methodology, that has taken together, creation, deliver,
mentioned by [8], [9]  and [10], when the concept was first conceived, its main purpose was to put companies into the service of the  transformation to a more sustainable economic system  and to provide leverage for integrating sustainability  considerations into organizations and helping companies to achieve their sustainability ambitions.    It is rather common in literature to see sustainable business models as a modification of the conve ntional business  model concept, that incorporate either concepts, principles, or goals that aim at sustainability, or integrate sustainability  into their value proposition, value creation and delivery activities, and /  or value capture mechanisms. Accordin g to  [11], [12], [13], [14] and [15], it implies a process of continually business model exploration, adjustment,  improvement, redesign, revision, creation, development, adoption, and transformation. Targeting cost reduction,  process optimization, introduction of new products, accession to new markets, and, of course, ultimately financial performance improvement.   Lean is a way of thinking and acting for an entire organization, and not merely a tact ic or a cost reduction program  [16]. [17] adapted the lean principles to the entrepreneurial strategy area by elaborating the lean startup process.  Considered practitioners, [18] have given substantial contributions to the recently introduced lean startup methodology  [17]. It rejects long- term planning and embrace s experimentation and iterative learning. Attracting much attention  from entrepreneurs, practitioners and academics [17] and [19].  The aim of this paper is to develop a unified theoretical perspective for understanding Business Model Innovations  and Lean S tartup Process, that lead those recently started firms to better organizational, economic, environmental and  social performance.

as follows: on this introduction a contextualization was made, also was  presented the objective of thi s article. On Section 2 will be presented the method used on this work. On Section 3 the  most important concepts regarding the objective will be presented. On Section 4 will be presented the correlation found between the author regarding the BMI and Lean S tartup Process. Following, will be presented the final  considerations and the references used on the article.      2. Methodology  The development of this article is based in an exploratory and descriptive research on the data published on BMI  and Lean Startup,  to contextualize and define the BMI and Lean Startup methodologies, both in a qualitative way.  According to [20], an exploratory research helps understanding the context of an unfamiliar area or situation and the  descriptive approach can explore a correla tion between subjects. Our study at hand draws especially attention to  startups by exploring factors that influence BMI in the pivoting process. This paper explores how the BMI  methodology and the lean startup methodology contribute to a prescriptive accel erator.     In order to assure that the references chosen are in accordance with the objective of this study, the authors decided  to use the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol, which is used to identify, evaluate and interpret all available research  relevant to a particular research question  [21]. The protocol consists in several activities, divided in three  stages: planning, conducting and reporting [21]. Table 1 describes the procedures adopted on this SLR.

Literature Review   In this literature review, we will present a review on the BMI theory and methodology.  It will be followed by an  overview of the lean startup methodology, as a powerful theory deeply influencing startup sustainability.   3.1. The Business Model Innovation (BMI)  and The Business Model Innovation methodology   As mentioned by [22], innovation is known to often strongly challenge organizational processes.  Therefore, it is  true that a stream of research relates BMI to organizational change processes. This stream emphasizes the capabilities,  leadership,  and learning mechanisms that are needed for successful BMI. Studies within this stream describe BMI as  a dynamic process by highlighting the differ ent stages of the BMI process [23], [24], [25] and [26]. They identify the  different organizational capabili ties and processes required to support this change process [27], [28] and [29], citing  the importance o f experimentation and learning [30], [31], [32], [33] and [34], and proposing practitioner -oriented
by [39] and [46], as the result of BMI methodology, that has taken together, creation, deliver, and capture  value. Perceiving usefulness for customers, identifying the manner incomes are generated and costs are structured and  describing the need of resources and processes , respectively.

Entrepreneurship and sustainability   Entrepreneurship is intrinsically linked to BMI: For start -ups, any act of entrepreneurship means the choice of a  BM, while in established firms the exercise of entrepreneurial judgment results in changes in the BM’s components  or architecture. According to  [49], BMI is tightly linked to the idea of entrepreneurial vision, imagination, and  judgment. Predominantly referring to BMI in the context of innovative start -ups. To be sustainable, a startup needs t o  grow. The business model needs to be designed in a way that the company can scale up quickly and maybe even go international. Besides growth, startups need capital and investors to sustain months or even years of non -profitability.  If the business model is no longer attractive to investors, startups will find it difficult to pitch for new money.   3.3. The lean startup and The lean startup methodology   The “Lean philosophy” and its principles originated in the manufacturing world after the end of the Second World   War, as a result of customers' needs evolving towards higher value in combination with companies' increasingly diverse offer  [50; 51].   According to [51], this significant redirection of production systems towards customer value refers to the concept  where value is created by a decrease of internal waste, reducing cost production, and by an increase of new services or function offer to the customer, enhancing profit. They also call the attention that the costs of every firm must be  transparent to all supply chain partners. Another major issue stated was the importance of flow creation, avoiding any  stoppage, such as changes in production, breakdowns, incorrect batches in terms of quantity or timing, lack of  necessary information and re -entrant l oops.  [17] made an attempt to
quantity or timing, lack of  necessary information and re -entrant l oops.  [17] made an attempt to adapt and combine the lean philosophy and its  principles to the startups' development area by elaborating the Lean Startup Methodology. In his 2011 New York Times bestseller “The Lean Startup”, [17] introduces the term “pivot”  in the context of business models to the academic  world. It centers on the question whether a startup should decide to pivot or to persevere. He defines a pivot as a major  change, a structured course correction “designed to test a new fundamental hypothes is about the product, business  model, and engine of growth”. According to him, pivoting, refers to major changes and course corrections instead of incremental adjustments and can be viewed as a concept of BMI.   Inspired by the lean manufacturing principles  (avoiding waste and optimizing resource spending) and [52] ideas,  [17] introduced the lean startup methodology, defined as the startup's attempt to cut its own waste, understood as all  the activities and processes which the target customer do es not want o r does not ask for . In his 2011 New York Times  bestseller “The Lean Startup”,  the term “pivot” is introduced in the context of business m odels to the academic world,  centering on the question whether a startup should decide to pivot or to persevere. According to [17], pivoting, refers  to major changes and course corrections instead of incremental adjustments and can be viewed as a concept of BMI.   The Lean Startup Methodology consists of a scientific, hypothesis -driven ap proach to entrepreneurship, where  entrepreneurs translate their vision (i.e. business idea) into falsifiable hypotheses which are embedded in a first version  of a business model. These hypotheses are then tested through a series of minimum viable products (MVPs). [19]  define the MVP as “the smallest set of activities needed to disprove a hypothesis”. The process is iterated until all key  hypotheses
of activities needed to disprove a hypothesis”. The process is iterated until all key  hypotheses are confirmed or validated through MVP tests. When this condition is reached, the startup has achieved its  “product -market fit” [19], which means that the value proposition designed and iteratively revised by the startup  actually satisfies the needs of its target customers. According to  [18], this fit hence represents the successful conclusion  of the “build -measure -learn” loop, where the startup builds an MVP and associated tests, measures the test results and  customer feedback and learns how to change its business idea and business model accordingly. The ultimate goal of  the methodology is to guide entrepreneurs i n finding this fit.   It engages entrepreneur into process designing to test the assumptions that constitute the business model [17], and  creating a “minimum viable product” (MVP). Through rigorous evaluation of the results, the invalidated assumptions are replaced and new assumptions are tested. This process continues until a reasonable number of tests point to the  validation of critical assumptions. Finally, when all the remaining assumptions are validated, “product -market fit” is  achieved [17].

Discussio n  Throughout our review, our qualitative research on the data published on BMI and Lean Startup, led us to consider  eight  articles, which  were  identified as important documents to explain and address the contribution of BMI and Lean  Startup Methodologies i n startup´s sustainability.

also  observed by [38] when they stated that there is an increasing consensus that  BMI is key to firm performance. Those  ideas were apparently confirmed by [43]. They concluded that BMI may provide mechanisms to assist the innovation  process for embedding sustainability. Correlating the researches done by [27] and [39], we can identify that more and  more companies now are turning toward  BMI business model innovat ion as an alternative to product or process  innovation. As well as cost and waste reduction via a prototyping process. [27] considered BMI to be a great tool to  experimentation that can lead to through trial -and-error learning.   A focus on the sustained val ue creation was presented by [27] as guideline for companies which manage to  successfully adapt and renew their business models over time. Statement that was also noted on the research placed  by [39] that presented an inductive theory on the sources of val ue creation, showing how value- creation enhances the  potential of a business model. [43] demonstrated possibilities for sustainable business models and how to translate  social and environmental value creation into economic profit and competitive advantage for the firm. Discussing the  main purpose of a business model and why the business model concept is offered, [38] defined the value creation  mechanism as competitive advantage and strategic to understand new networked modes of innovation.  [19] concluded  that the lean startup is a business model that allows new ventures unique value creation and sustainable profits.  Researching the  BMI in digital entrepreneurship,  [53] also identified the importance of value creation to startup´s early  stages of development.   Finally, [19] affirmed that the lean startup methodology unlike other methods, balances the strong direction that  comes from a founder’s vision with the need for redirection that follows from market feedback, corroborating with the  strategic perspective of this business
that follows from market feedback, corroborating with the  strategic perspective of this business model. While investigating digital startups in the early stages , [53] concluded  throughout the data collection and analysis steps, that BMI and Lean Startup are related. The Lean Startup methodology can be perceived as a strategic business model, and as concluded by  [16], may play a significant role in  advancing the BM research in its theory and operative tools.

Conclusion   This study investigated the relation amongst BMI and Lean Startup and how they may contribute to deliver  sustainability  to startups. Our work provides value for theory by combining and connecting author´s lines of works  towards a sustainable value creation for those new enterprises.   The mainstream of a business model is that it hardens customer needs, defining how the bus iness enterprise delivers  value to customers, attract customers to pay for value, and t ransform payments into profit. BMI Business model   innovation and lean startup methodologies are certainly built on these ideas, but especially  the lean startup approach  evaluates an early stage startup’s entire business model. It introduces the minimum viable products concept that  efficiently test business model hypotheses, and pivots that change certain business model elements in response to failed  hypothesis tests.   Ultimately, our study guided us to conclude those methodologies balance the strong direction that comes from a  founder’s vision with the need for redirection that follows from market feedback. The key conclusion of our analysis  is that, to be a source of comp etitive advantage, a business model must be something more than just a good logical  way of doing business. A sustainable model must meet particular customer needs. It arouses the need of innovative forms to approach customers and it certainly guides enterprises’ value capture strategies to achieve superior results.   Overall, we conclude that advancing the understanding of startup´s business sustainability is a relevant top ic. More  research remains to be done to validate our conclusion and to advance the cur rent understanding of the startup  environment.   6. Limitations and future research   Further research can mend this study’s
startup  environment.   6. Limitations and future research   Further research can mend this study’s limitations, related to the lack of reliable sources of literature that validates  a strong correlation among those variables. Moreover, we  recognize that quantitative studies may also be necessary to  confirm our qualitative analysis.   The resulting value for practice takes the form of identifying the core elements that startups should consider  carefully while building their business model.    References  [1] Teece, D. J.

**Resumen Detallado del Texto Proporcionado:**

**Contexto General:**
El texto es un resumen de un artículo académico titulado "The Business Model Innovation and Lean Startup Process Supporting Startup Sustainability", escrito por Vinícius Figueiredo de Faria, Vanessa Pereira Santos y Fernando Hadad Zaidan, publicado en 2020 en Procedia Computer Science, bajo la licencia CC BY-NC-ND. Este artículo se encuentra disponible en la plataforma ScienceDirect y ha sido revisado por pares. Está vinculado a tres conferencias internacionales celebradas en 2020: CENTERIS, ProjMAN y HCist, que abordan temas de sistemas de información empresarial, gestión de proyectos y tecnologías en salud.

**Objetivo del Artículo:**
El artículo se centra en la relación entre la innovación en modelos de negocio (BMI) y la metodología Lean Startup, explorando cómo estas pueden contribuir a la sostenibilidad de las startups. Los autores argumentan que, a pesar de la relevancia de estas metodologías, existe una falta de investigación que conecte teóricamente y prácticamente la innovación en modelos de negocio con la sostenibilidad de las startups. El objetivo principal es desarrollar una perspectiva teórica unificada que explique cómo estas metodologías pueden mejorar el rendimiento organizacional, económico, ambiental y social de las empresas emergentes.

**Importancia del Modelo de Negocio:**
Los autores destacan que un modelo de negocio bien definido es crucial para el rendimiento de cualquier empresa. Sin embargo, señalan que el concepto de modelo de negocio carece de una base teórica sólida en la literatura de economía y negocios, lo que indica la necesidad de un marco teórico más robusto que apoye su comprensión y aplicación.

**Metodología Lean Startup:**
La metodología Lean Startup se presenta como un enfoque que permite a los emprendedores validar rápidamente sus ideas de negocio, minimizando riesgos y desperdicios. Este enfoque se basa en la creación de prototipos, la obtención de retroalimentación del cliente y la iteración continua, facilitando la adaptación y mejora del modelo de negocio.

**Contribución a la Sostenibilidad:**
El artículo sugiere que la combinación de la innovación en modelos de negocio y la metodología Lean Startup no solo puede mejorar la viabilidad económica de las startups, sino que también puede impactar positivamente su desempeño ambiental y social. Esto es especialmente relevante en un contexto donde la sostenibilidad se ha convertido en un factor clave para el éxito a largo plazo de las empresas.

**Conclusiones:**
Los autores concluyen que es esencial seguir investigando la interrelación entre la innovación en modelos de negocio y la metodología Lean Startup para proporcionar a los emprendedores herramientas más efectivas que les permitan prosperar en un entorno empresarial competitivo. Se sugiere que la investigación futura podría enfocarse en desarrollar modelos teóricos que integren estos conceptos y en realizar estudios empíricos que validen sus hallazgos.
