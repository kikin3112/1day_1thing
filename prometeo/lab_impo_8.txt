RESEARCH ARTICLE Who gets a job sooner? Results from a national survey of master ’s graduates Adriana Perez-Encinasaand Jasmina Berbegal-Mirabentb aDepartment of Business Organisations, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain;bDepartment of Management, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Vilanova i la Geltrú, Spain ABSTRACT This study investigates the factors that in ﬂuence how long it takes for master ’s-level graduate students to ﬁnd employment. The original contribution stems from questioning whether the structure and content of university programmes play a role in graduates ’ability to secure jobs. To this end, we focus on three dimensions at three points in time aftergraduation: competence acquisition, teaching methods and programme characteristics. The dataset comes from a large-scale study ongraduates ’employability by the Observatory for University Employability and Employment (OEEU) and contains detailedinformation about master ’s degree graduates in Spain. A multinomial logit estimated by the maximum likelihood method is used to identify the critical factors in ﬂuencing the likelihood of acquiring a job sooner. Theﬁndings indicate that educational programmes fail to provide the necessary competencies to ensure a smooth transition from the university to the job market and that study programme initiativesrelated to active learning and internships make a di ﬀerence in this transition. We believe that these results shed light on speci ﬁc characteristics of academic programmes and should be considered during programme design to enhance graduates ’employability and faster labour market insertion.KEYWORDS Higher education; graduate employability; master ’s graduates; competencedevelopment; teachingmethod; study programme Introduction Over the past years, society’ s expectations about universities ’responsibility to produce highly qualiﬁed graduates have increased substantially (Clarke, 2018 ).

increased substantially (Clarke, 2018 ). Against this backdrop, this study is centred on graduates ’employability. ‘Employability ’can be de ﬁned as a set of competencies, under- standing and personal attributes that render graduates more likely to gain employment and be suc- cessful in their chosen occupations, thus bene ﬁting themselves, the workforce, the community and the economy (Yorke 2006 ). As stated both in the OECD report Enhancing the Higher Education System Performance (2017 ) and in Bridgstock ’s(2019 ) work, HEIs are expected to foster the learning out- comes that employers value by developing student ’s employment skills. This study investigates the factors a ﬀecting the time it takes for master ’s degree graduates to obtain their ﬁrst jobs after completing their academic programmes. Building upon existing literature on graduate employability, we scrutinise three core factors, namely competence development,teaching methods and programme characteristics in relation to three pro ﬁles for master ’s graduate students: those who found employment within six months after graduation, those who foundemployment within six months to one year and those who had failed to secure employment over © 2022 Society for Research into Higher EducationCONTACT Jasmina Berbegal-Mirabent jasmina.berbegal@upc.edu Department of Management, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Vilanova i la Geltrú, SpainSTUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION 2023, VOL. 48, NO. 1, 174 –188 https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2022.2124242
one year after graduation. The novelty of our approach resides in integrating the analyses of the aforementioned dimensions, which have been either overlooked by previous researchers or exam-ined in isolation. Moreover, we contribute to expanding the limited number of studies in which master ’s graduates ’employability is assessed. The empirical application considers the case of Spain. Data come from a pioneering survey on graduate employability run by the OEEU. According to Lindberg ( 2007 ), the use of graduate surveys is most appropriate for measuring the employability of graduates, provides useful infor- mation for stakeholders and is a mean for benchmarking and comparing institutionalperformance. Literature review A comprehensive review of the existing literature –including scholarly articles and relevant grey lit- erature –was conducted to determine the factors that enhance graduates ’chances of ﬁnding a job. The review brought to light a variety of factors, which were grouped into three categories: compe- tence acquisition, teaching methods and programme characteristics. We elaborate on each of these pillars below. Competence development Higher education is expected to contribute to the development of a variety of complex competen- cies that enhance the stock of human capital and foster national economic well-being (Wickrama- singhe and Perera 2010 ). Although students still view higher education credentials as positioning them favourably in the labour market, graduates ’competencies have increasingly become more important than their academic credentials in the recruitment process (Succi and Canovi 2020 ). A recent study analysing 21 million job advertisements in the UK (Brown and Souto-Otero 2020 ) conﬁ rms the importance given to job readiness as opposed to showing a minimum level of attainment. Employers seek sets of personal and professional competencies that ﬁt with the requirements of the job market. In this research we use the ﬁve categories of generic
ﬁt with the requirements of the job market. In this research we use the ﬁve categories of generic competencies provided by the OEEU Barometer: technical skills related to the ﬁeld or discipline, skills and attitudes (e.g. information and communication technology skills, communication abilities, foreign languages, planning, organ-ising), systemic competencies (e.g. creativity, personal initiative, leadership, adaptability, innovation), cognitive and methodological competencies (e.g. problem-solving, analytical thinking, working under pressure), and interpersonal competencies (e.g. the ability to work in teams or in an international context, appreciation of diversity, multiculturality). As stressed in the Bologna Declaration in 1999, one of the key questions to address is how to develop a model in which curricula ensure a meaningful preparation for the labour market (Sarkaret al. 2020 ). Notwithstanding, although competencies play a key role when evaluating prospective candidates for a job oﬀ er, there is still limited evidence regarding which types are more decisive and in which contexts, and how they should be introduced in course curricula. Accordingly, our ﬁrst hypothesis (H1) posits that the larger the variety of competencies acquired during a master ’s pro- gramme, the higher the likelihood of ﬁnding a job sooner. Teaching methods Teaching methodologies can impact the learning process and the future employability of graduates.Various voices argue for a renewal of the teaching process (Hyun et al. 2017 ). The outdated and irre- levant curriculum in the higher education system has led to university graduates being ill-prepared(Tran 2015 ; Osmani et al. 2015 ). Teaching should go beyond pouring knowledge into a student ’s head. In this context, the use of student-centred active learning strategies is seen as an e ﬀectiveSTUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION 175
way to foster higher employment rates (Jackson and Bridgstock 2018 ,2021 ; Roderick 2019 ). Active learning and experiential learning are alternative teaching strategies that break with traditional methodologies and include practical action, either by participating or by doing, mimicking real work situations. Current pedagogical trends tend to inspire lecturers to incorporate skill development opportu- nities into curricula design. Recent studies (e.g. Kelly et al. 2019 ; Rohanai et al. 2020 ) further support the belief that active learning methods as well boosting university-industry collaboration through the teaching mission (Berbegal-Mirabent et al. 2020 ) provide students with the opportunity to apply newly learnt knowledge to practical situations, thereby simultaneously developing and rein- forcing employability skills. In line with these arguments, our second hypothesis (H2) states that stu- dents following master ’s programmes in which active learning methods have a prominent role have a greater chance of securing a job soon after graduation. To test this, we classi ﬁed teaching methods into three categories –traditional, moderate and active learning –based on the intensity of the student-centric approach. Characteristics of the programme Since the creation of the European Higher Education Area in 1999, HEIs have invested considerableresources in improving students ’employability skills by enriching academic programmes with a variety of activities. These include work-based learning experiences or internships and mobility pro- grammes, and there is widespread agreement about the unique opportunities these experiences provide to students, employers and HEIs alike (Byrne 2022 ). Internships are believed to oﬀ er an autonomous, multifaceted context for learning that fosters professional maturation (Petzold 2021 ; Wilton 2012 ). According to Bittmann and Zorn ( 2020 ), there are three main theoretical corpuses that could help explain why internships should
( 2020 ), there are three main theoretical corpuses that could help explain why internships should improvelabour market outcomes. On the one hand, the human capital theory (Becker 2009 ) suggests that, given that knowledge and skills are not learnt only in educational institutions, work placementshelp students to acquire practical competencies, raising their market value. Second, according tothe signalling theory (Spence 1973 ), graduates with internships signal motivation, relevant abilities and productivity, which are positively evaluated by future employers. Finally, following the socialcapital theory and its application in higher education (Fuller et al. 2011 ), internships increase one’s social capital, and larger social networks are associated with superior labour market outcomes. In the Spanish context, internships in master ’s programmes are typically part of the study plans but tend to be optional. Spending a period abroad at a di ﬀerent university is another characteristic of academic pro- grammes. International mobility is not only a personally enriching experience, but can alsowidens career opportunities abroad and at home as an overseas quali ﬁcation does often lead to substantial labour market rewards (Brooks and Waters 2011 ).International mobility also enhances an individual’ s network and cultural and linguistic knowledge of the foreign country. Although results are inconclusive regarding the speci ﬁc value of study abroad for employment prospects (Wiers-Jenssen 2008 ; Pinto 2022 ), there is a general belief that employers tend to credit candidates who spent a period of their studies abroad because it shows that they areable to leave their comfort zones and face new challenges. In Spain, Iriondo ( 2020 ) found that in the medium term Erasmus study mobility had a positive impact on graduates ’employment prospects and resulted in them receiving salaries that were 10-12% higher than those of non-participants. In light of the above considerations, we
that were 10-12% higher than those of non-participants. In light of the above considerations, we argue that the time it takes to secure their ﬁrst job is shorter for master ’s graduates who have a mobility period during their studies (H3). Similarly, those students who bene ﬁt from an internship placement with an industry partner as part of their master ’s programme are more likely to ﬁnd a job sooner (H4).176 A. PEREZ-ENCINAS AND J.

Data and methods Context: the Spanish higher education system The focus of this study is on Spanish students who have completed a master ’s degree. Master ’s pro- grammes are at ISCED (International Standard Classi ﬁcation of Education) level 7. Their length ranges between one and two academic years (60 and 120 ECTS respectively). Candidates must hold an oﬃcial university degree to qualify for admission at this level. Universities have autonomy to design the curricula of these programmes as long as they fulﬁ l a set of requirements established by the National Agency for Quality Assessment and Accreditation (ANECA), which, in turn, arealigned with the principles set by the European Higher Education Area. Spain is an interesting case to study because universities are bridging long-term integration with the labour market (Di Meglio et al. 2022 ). In fact, Spanish graduates at master and doctoral levels have the highest employment rates at 84% and 90% employment respectively (CYD Foundation 2019 ). Sample The data come from a survey on employability run by the OEEU. We used the OEEU’ s Barometer, which analysed the employability of master ’s degree graduates who had completed their studies during the 2013/2014 academic year in Spain. It had yielded responses from 6,738 graduates from 50 Spanish public and private universities. The dataset merged the administrative records of the universities with those of a survey in which graduates were asked about their work trajectory,the training they had received, and the relationship between their training and employment. To have a complete dataset, we deleted those observations from which information of interest was missing. A ﬁnal sample of 1,672 completed records met the requirements. Measures Dependent variable The dependent variable (see Table 1) was the time it took recent master ’s graduates to get their ﬁrst job. The criteria for the selected cut-o ﬀpoints (six months and one year) follow the National Associ- ation of
for the selected cut-o ﬀpoints (six months and one year) follow the National Associ- ation of Colleges and Employers ’(NACE, 2014 ) requirements, which were adhered to for several national surveys around the world, such as the ‘UK First-destination Returns ’(see also Støren and Wiers-Jenssen 2016 ; Di Meglio et al. 2022 ). Additionally, the annual employability report executed by Adecco ( 2020 ) set the criteria as employment within six months, between six months and one year, and beyond one year. Explanatory variables Competencies . The OEEU Barometer paid special attention to a list of generic competencies that uni- versity graduates are expected to acquire. For the purpose of this study, we were interested in a question that required the participants to rate the extent to which their master ’s programmes had contributed to the development of these competencies according to a 7-point Likert scale (see Table 2). Table 1. Operationalization of the dependent variable and responses in each category. Time to employment Frequency Percentage (%) Within the ﬁrst 6 months 1,106 66.1 Between 6 months and 1 year 196 11.7 >1 year (including those that did not ﬁnd a job) 370 22.1STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION 177
Teaching method. The survey also included a question regarding the extent to which various teaching and learning methods were implemented in the respondents’ master ’s programmes. These methods were grouped into three categories (see Table 3). Traditional approaches refer to instruction modes in which students are passive recipients of knowledge from an expert. Conversely, in active learning methods, students are asked to become active agents in the learning process and to engage in diverse activities. Moderate approaches are placed in-between. To verify the suitability of these groupings, a principal component analysis was conducted. Both Bartlett ’s sphericity test ( χ2= 3133.263 with 45 degrees of freedom, p-value = 0.000) and the Kaiser- Meyer-Olkin value test (KMO = 0.728, p-value = 0.000) validated our approach. Next, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted, retaining three factors with eigenvalues greater than 1. The teaching methods were grouped according to the expected categories, with loadings greater than 0.5 in all instances.Table 2. List of competencies.

Characteristics of the programme. Two variables were included. First, we considered whether the students spent a period abroad during their master ’s(mobility ) programmes. Second, we distin- guished between programmes that included a training period in a company ( internship ) and those that did not. These two variables were coded as dummy variables (1 if yes, 0 otherwise). Control variables. We included a variable ( performance ) capturing the students ’levels of attain- ment. Unfortunately, the Barometer did not include students ’numerical grades, but rather distin- guished between students who were graded with a pass (coded as 1), very good (2) or honours (3). We also controlled for potential di ﬀerences due to gender (1 males, 0 females), studying and working ( study&work ) simultaneously (1 if yes, otherwise 0), and the ownership of the university in which the students were enrolled (1 public, 0 private). Moreover, we included a categorical variableto diﬀerentiate areas of knowledge ( discipline ). Table 4 contains the descriptive statics of all these variables. Methodology Scale validation Ourﬁrst step involved testing the suitability of the competence groupings in the categories listed in Table 2 as this classi ﬁcation was proposed in the Barometer and we did not ﬁnd any empirical analy- sis verifying the validity of this approach. We analysed the unidimensionality of each factor. In allinstances, the analysis extracted only one factor, corroborating the adequacy of the approach (see Table 5). Both the Cronbach ’s alpha and the composite reliability (CR) exceeded the cut-o ﬀpoint of 0.7, indicating good internal consistency. The average variance extracted (AVE) also exceeded the recommended threshold (>0.5) for all the factors. The analysis of the discriminant validity con ﬁrmed the suitability of these factors. Table 6 shows the correlation matrix, in which the square root of each of the AVEs –shown in italics on the diagonal –was greater than the elements
square root of each of the AVEs –shown in italics on the diagonal –was greater than the elements outside the diagonal. The only exception was interpersonal compe- tencies, which showed some overlap with systemic and cognitive skills. Thus, while the grouping was correct and served the purposes of this study, future researchers are advised to revise the instrument that captures this information. This is a limitation of this study but, as noted by Heckman ( 2000 ), some skills are not yet well captured by standardised scales. Given that the OEEU study was the only survey capturing this sort of data at a national level, we decided to proceed with the analysis. Multinomial logit To correctly test the hypotheses, we used a multinomial logit estimated by the maximum likelihoodmethod, as shown in Equation [1]: Pr(Y i=k)=ebjXi ∑ j=0ebjXi(1) where k(k=0, 1, 2) refers to the situations under analysis: ﬁnding a job within the ﬁrst six monthsTable 4.

The teaching method variables ( b2) included students ’perceptions of the extent of the application of di ﬀerent teaching methods within the programme, and the character- istics of the programme ( b3) captured whether a student undertook a mobility period abroad and/or an internship during their master ’s programme. The control variables corresponded to the ﬁnal grade achieved by the student in the programme, their gender, whether they had studied and worked simultaneously, university ownership and a categorical variable indicating the area of knowledge.Table 5.

Results The results in Table 7 suggest that the students who indicated that the master ’s programme helped them to develop interpersonal skills were less likely to remain unemployed for more than one year. The development of cognitive skills raises the probability of ﬁnding a job one year after graduation but not within the ﬁrst six months. The marginal eﬀ ects ( Table 8) contribute additional insights. For attitudes, an increase of one unit in this skill is associated with being 3.2% less likely to fall into themiddle group ( ﬁnding employment between six months and one year post-graduation) and 4.2% more likely to struggle for more than one year to ﬁnd a job. These results partially support our ﬁrst hypothesis: competence development is relevant; however, not all competencies have the same eﬀ ect. Some competencies that were believed to in ﬂuence labour market activities, such as negotiation ability or languages, are not seen to be particularly relevant in the Spanish graduate labour market. Regarding teaching methods, the results support our second hypothesis that active learning methods are crucial. The importance of introducing student-centred approaches in place ofteacher-centric methods increases students ’probabilities of ﬁnding a job sooner. Turning to programme-speci ﬁc features, no eﬀ ect was found for the variable accounting for par- ticipation in exchange or mobility programmes; thus, there was no support for hypothesis 3. Contraryto our initial intuition, when looking at the e ﬀect of internships, we found that the students who participated in work placement programmes were more likely to take longer to ﬁnd a job (>1 year). Thus, hypothesis 4 is rejected. Table 7.

Finally, the control variables revealed no di ﬀerences due to gender, but a signi ﬁcant eﬀ ect was found for the variable study&work . A simultaneous combination of study and work was more com- monly found for students who found a job within the ﬁrst six months after graduation. Concerning university ownership, a short unemployment period was more likely for graduates who had attended a private university. However, this eﬀ ect was weak. When distinguishing by level of accomplishment, the results indicated that the students who performed well (grading: very good) were more likely to ﬁnd a job between the ﬁrst six months to one year after graduating. Similarly, excellent students were negatively associated with long periods of unemployment. In terms of ﬁeld of study, the engin- eering students were less likely to be without employment for more than one year. Given that the results were quite similar between groups 2 and 3 we carried out a robustness check to further investigate potential di ﬀerences in employment opportunities for students in these groups. In brief, the ﬁndings obtained with this new con ﬁguration do not di ﬀer signi ﬁcantly from the results already reported. The full results are reported in the Appendix. Discussion and implications HEIs are becoming increasingly more concerned with the integration of their graduates into the labour market and with designing institutional mechanisms to facilitate students ’transition from higher education to the job market (Silva et al. 2016 ). While this phenomenon has been largely docu- mented in the literature, previous research eﬀ orts have overlooked the role that HEIs play in this process. With a view to ﬁlling this gap, this study comprises an examination of how the structure and the content of university master ’s programmes in ﬂuence the time it takes for master ’s degree graduates to obtain their ﬁrst job. By doing so, we go beyond the monolithic discourses that tend to dominate public debates and limit the
doing so, we go beyond the monolithic discourses that tend to dominate public debates and limit the study of employability to skills development. Similar to Jackson and Bridgstock ( 2021 ), we acknowledge the relevance of skill acquisition, but we also broaden the concept of employability to other dimensions.Table 8.

Our results have several implications for managerial considerations. First, they suggest that skill acquisition –measured in terms of self-appraisal –has low predictive power in relation to employ- ment. Among the various skills categories, cognitive and systemic skills were found to play a role, albeit in opposite directions, while interpersonal skills appeared to be more important at work than cognitive competencies (also seen in Salas-Velasco ( 2014 ) and Petzold ( 2021 )). These ﬁndings call into question the eﬀ ectiveness of competence development at HEIs to facilitate stu- dents ’transition from university to the workforce. In Spain, as in many other countries, the higher education system is still largely focused on the provision of technical knowledge. A clear exampleis found in the indicators used to assess students ’performance, most of which are designed to evalu- ate the acquisition of knowledge rather than the students ’experience and skill development. While knowing and understanding the principles of a discipline are fundamental, one cannot underesti-mate the importance of the progressive demand for non-technical skills. The main challenge lies in how to adequately balance technical and non-technical skills in curricula and provide a variety of learning activities that promote social connectedness (Bridgstock 2019 ). Although universities are increasingly encouraging their teachers to update their practices, the system is still oriented to the long tradition of professor-centred approaches. The Covid-19 pandemichas accelerated this debate and moved education forward to a new paradigm of teaching. Our studyprovides evidence that active learning methods do make a di ﬀerence, complementing the works of Jackson and Bridgstock ( 2021 ), Kelly et al. ( 2019 ) and Rohanai et al. ( 2020 ). Thus, it is imperative to enrich students ’learning experiences with more hands-on activities, giving them the opportunity to learn while doing, vocalise their knowledge,
hands-on activities, giving them the opportunity to learn while doing, vocalise their knowledge, and learn with and from others. A higher concentration of student-centred learning activities, in combination with social interactions (Bridgstock 2019 ), can enhance graduates ’employability. However, in order to transform traditional pedagogical practices into competence-based teaching and shift to a more student-centred approach, the higher edu-cation system must provide academic sta ﬀwith more resources, time and facilities to update their courses. Another remarkable ﬁnding is that the positive association between mobility and employment in undergraduate programmes seems to dilute, as observed by Wiers-Jenssen and Støren ( 2021 ) and Van Mol et al. ( 2021 ). Master’ s programmes are shorter than bachelor ’s programmes; thus, employers may pay little attention to international experiences. Instead, they prioritise what students havegained from the programme and how this new knowledge and/or skills can be applied. It is impor- tant to recall that master ’s programmes tend to have a higher share of foreign students. Thus, even when domestic students do not travel abroad, they have the opportunity to work in an international and multicultural environment in their home institutions. Accordingly, we argue that master ’s pro- grammes should adopt a global perspective that includes the chance to unite participants –stu- dents, professors or guest speakers –from various nationalities in the academic o ﬀerings. Such an approach will enhance the social capital of the participants, blur geographical and linguistic borders and extend their network. Additionally, our ﬁndings indicate that the eﬀ ect of job placements on student employability might not be straightforward. Several interpretations should be considered. First, companiesmight not fully capitalise on the opportunities inherent in internships. According to Di Meglioet.al (2022), only 7.6% of interns are converted to
inherent in internships. According to Di Meglioet.al (2022), only 7.6% of interns are converted to fulltime employees by the companies at which they did their internships. Likewise, data from the Servicio Público de Empleo Estatal platform in 2019 indicate that only three out of 10 student interns are hired full-time by the company following their internships. Although the goal should be to make full-time hires from interns, various factors might prevent them from doing so (e.g. there are no full-time positions open at that time or thecompany cannot a ﬀord to hire them). An alternative explanation relates to the human and signalling theories. Work experience obtained through internships contributes to raise graduates ’market value. However, the oﬀ er is limited, and one might observe a mismatch between graduates ’expec- tations of their ﬁrst jobs and what companies are looking for, resulting in a situation of overquali ﬁca- tion (Livanos 2010 ). A third explanation is that the master ’s programme might be seen as mandatorySTUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION 183
step for career trajectories, such as students who intend to pursue doctoral degrees having to ﬁrst complete a master ’s programme or workers enrolled in upskilling programmes in their companies. In the latter case, master ’s students already have a job before starting their master ’s programme (CYD Foundation 2019 ). Consequently, once they graduate, they return to their company, bene ﬁting from the new knowledge and skills acquired. This is a fairly common practice in certain disciplines with a high labour insertion rate in Spain. Fourth, it is relevant to question whether the typology of the internship plays a role. Voluntary or extracurricular internships have been found to display highly signiﬁcant positive eﬀ ects in relation to labour market outcomes (Jackson 2018 ), yet, no e ﬀects were observed for mandatory internships (Bittmann and Zorn 2020 ). Unfortunately, our data did not contain information concerning voluntary internships; therefore, our results should be inter-preted with caution. We encourage further studies to be conducted in this direction as one of theselling points of master ’s programmes is the inclusion of job placements as a bridge to stable employment. Finally, there are three additional characteristics that deserve attention. Students from private universities seem to be in an advantageous position compared to those attending public universities because the time between graduation and employment is more likely to be shorter for them. O ﬃcial statistics support this ﬁnding (Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades 2019 ). A similar pattern was observed for engineering students, who typically found a job sooner (<1 year). Thisresult is also unsurprising because engineering skills are among the most in demand in Spain (CYD Foundation 2019 ; Adecco 2020 ). Students in the experimental sciences are more likely to ﬁnd a job in six to 12 months after completing their master ’s degrees. Similar results for engineering students and those
months after completing their master ’s degrees. Similar results for engineering students and those in the experimental sciences were found by Livanos ( 2010 ). Finally, when control- ling for the simultaneous eﬀ ect of working and studying, we observed that this combination had a positive eﬀ ect, suggesting that students either keep their jobs once they ﬁnish their master ’s pro- grammes or that this working experience has helped them to develop networks within theirchosen industries (as explained by both the social capital and signalling theories). Concluding remarks This study interrogates the extent to which the structure and content of university programmes play a role in preparing graduates to enter the workforce. We analysed the impact of competence devel- opment, teaching methods and programme characteristics on the employment probabilities ofmaster ’s degree graduates at three points of time. The empirical analysis was based on a large- scale national survey in Spain. Our results are subject to a number caveats that should be acknowledged. First, our database comprised detailed information about master ’s degree graduates in a given coutnry. To guarantee the respondents ’anonymity, the survey did not solicit any information concerning the universities attended, with the only exception of university ownership. Moreover, there was no informationabout territory; consequently, we cannot infer from which university (or region) students graduated. While controls such as the characteristics of the region, status, prestige and size of the university might provide relevant insights concerning employers ’recruitment practices and students ’mobility decisions, the existing surveys seem to have neglected the importance of collecting such infor- mation. Likewise, the inclusion of personal and psychological attributes or contextual factors consti- tute a promising area for future research. We are aware that the absence of these controls in ourstudy constitutes an
for future research. We are aware that the absence of these controls in ourstudy constitutes an important shortcoming. However, given the uniqueness of this dataset and the lack of studies at master ’s level, we believe our approach captures, with the highest possible level of accuracy, the situation of master ’s graduates who are seeking their ﬁrst job. Another direc- tion for future research involves analysing the e ﬀect of work-based learning experiences abroad and at multinational companies. Finally, knowing more about the pro ﬁle of graduates who require more than one year to get a job is a matter of interest for policymakers and education leaders. Unfortu- nately, the limited data did not allow for this type of analysis. Therefore, future researchers might184 A. PEREZ-ENCINAS AND J. BERBEGAL-MIRABENT
consider collecting data in a more comprehensive way, which might, in turn, require qualitative tech- niques for the analysis. All in all, we believe the outputs of this study can assist educators, policymakers and employers to make more informed decisions about course design and the type of university-industry partnershipsrequired to ensure that graduates are equipped with the right skills, knowledge and tools to securejobs. The results might also be valuable for graduate students because they point to some speci ﬁc characteristics of academic programmes that should be considered when looking for a master ’s programme.

Appendix Using the available data, it is feasible to di ﬀerentiate between di ﬀerent groups of students based on the length of the post-graduation unemployment period. These groups are mutually exclusive, and a student cannot be classi ﬁed in more than one group. To further corroborate di ﬀerences between groups, we scrutinized the existence of potential diﬀerences between students in group 2 (between six months and one year to ﬁnd a job) and group 3 (more than one year of unemployment) using the independent of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) test. The IIA test assumes that the characteristics of a chosen alternative do not impact the relative probabilities of choos- ing other alternatives. In our context, its application allows us to verify whether omitting categories in the dependent variable yields to more consistent and e ﬃcient parameter estimates (Hausman and McFadden 1984 ). More speci ﬁcally, the null hypothesis is that all coe ﬃcients of the estimated parameters are equal for students in groups 2 and 3; con- sequently, students in these two groups may be analyzed together. The underlying reasoning behind this assumption is that some of the most relevant reports in this ﬁeld in Spain1tend to either not report on more than two groups (less than or more than six months to ﬁnd employment) or found no relevant characteristics to explain di ﬀerences in employment beyond the six-month timeframe. The Hausman test was calculated as shown in Equation (3 ), where sdenotes the
six-month timeframe. The Hausman test was calculated as shown in Equation (3 ), where sdenotes the estimator obtained with the restricted model and fthe estimator obtained with the model using the set of all possible alternatives. ˆVsandˆVfare the estimators of the asymptotic covariance matrices. x2=(ˆbs−ˆbf)′[ˆVs−ˆVf]−1(ˆbs−ˆbf) (3) The results are displayed in Table A1 and indicate that ˆbs−ˆbf=0 both when category 2 (employment between six months and one year after graduation) and 3 (more than one year of unemployment) are eliminated in the restricted models. Accordingly, in line with our initial prediction, these two categories can be merged into one group (more than six months to ﬁnd a job) since no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences are observed in the estimated parameters (see Table A1 ). Con- sequently, a Logit and Tobit model were preferred for the analysis. The new results are reported in Table A2 and operationalize the dependent variable as a dichotomous variable with the value of 1 if the length of post-graduation unemployment is no longer than six months; 0 is used for all other constellations.

chances of getting a job sooner. No signi ﬁ- cant e ﬀect is found for the other competencies investigated. Regarding teaching methods, the use of active learning approaches is linked to a reduced unemployment period. With relation to the speci ﬁc characteristics of the master ’s programme, both models provide additional evidence of the negative e ﬀect of completing an internship on ﬁnding a job, whereas —similarly to the multinomial logit model —simultaneously studying and working reduces the length of unemployment. Contrary to the previous analysis, the level of students ’achievement seems to be irrelevant to explaining post- graduation unemployment length; this absence of signi ﬁcance is consistent in both the Logit and Tobit models. This result re ﬂects the reality of the Spanish context (compared to other countries such as Italy), in which students ’ﬁnal score obtained at graduation is rarely included on CVs or in job interviews. Lastly, students who completed their master ’s at a private university seem to have better chances of ﬁnding a job sooner than those at public universities, although this association is only signi ﬁcant in the Logit model.188 A.

RESEARCH ARTICLE Who gets a job sooner? Results from a national survey of master ’s graduates Adriana Perez-Encinasaand Jasmina Berbegal-Mirabentb aDepartment of Business Organisations, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain;bDepartment of Management, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Vilanova i la Geltrú, Spain ABSTRACT This study investigates the factors that in ﬂuence how long it takes for master ’s-level graduate students to ﬁnd employment. The original contribution stems from questioning whether the structure and content of university programmes play a role in graduates ’ability to secure jobs. To this end, we focus on three dimensions at three points in time aftergraduation: competence acquisition, teaching methods and programme characteristics. The dataset comes from a large-scale study ongraduates ’employability by the Observatory for University Employability and Employment (OEEU) and contains detailedinformation about master ’s degree graduates in Spain. A multinomial logit estimated by the maximum likelihood method is used to identify the critical factors in ﬂuencing the likelihood of acquiring a job sooner. Theﬁndings indicate that educational programmes fail to provide the necessary competencies to ensure a smooth transition from the university to the job market and that study programme initiativesrelated to active learning and internships make a di ﬀerence in this transition. We believe that these results shed light on speci ﬁc characteristics of academic programmes and should be considered during programme design to enhance graduates ’employability and faster labour market insertion.KEYWORDS Higher education; graduate employability; master ’s graduates; competencedevelopment; teachingmethod; study programme Introduction Over the past years, society’ s expectations about universities ’responsibility to produce highly qualiﬁed graduates have increased substantially (Clarke, 2018 ). Against this backdrop, this study is centred on graduates
increased substantially (Clarke, 2018 ). Against this backdrop, this study is centred on graduates ’employability. ‘Employability ’can be de ﬁned as a set of competencies, under- standing and personal attributes that render graduates more likely to gain employment and be suc- cessful in their chosen occupations, thus bene ﬁting themselves, the workforce, the community and the economy (Yorke 2006 ). As stated both in the OECD report Enhancing the Higher Education System Performance (2017 ) and in Bridgstock ’s(2019 ) work, HEIs are expected to foster the learning out- comes that employers value by developing student ’s employment skills. This study investigates the factors a ﬀecting the time it takes for master ’s degree graduates to obtain their ﬁrst jobs after completing their academic programmes. Building upon existing literature on graduate employability, we scrutinise three core factors, namely competence development,teaching methods and programme characteristics in relation to three pro ﬁles for master ’s graduate students: those who found employment within six months after graduation, those who foundemployment within six months to one year and those who had failed to secure employment over © 2022 Society for Research into Higher EducationCONTACT Jasmina Berbegal-Mirabent jasmina.berbegal@upc.edu Department of Management, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Vilanova i la Geltrú, SpainSTUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION 2023, VOL. 48, NO. 1, 174 –188 https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2022.2124242
one year after graduation. The novelty of our approach resides in integrating the analyses of the aforementioned dimensions, which have been either overlooked by previous researchers or exam-ined in isolation. Moreover, we contribute to expanding the limited number of studies in which master ’s graduates ’employability is assessed. The empirical application considers the case of Spain. Data come from a pioneering survey on graduate employability run by the OEEU. According to Lindberg ( 2007 ), the use of graduate surveys is most appropriate for measuring the employability of graduates, provides useful infor- mation for stakeholders and is a mean for benchmarking and comparing institutionalperformance. Literature review A comprehensive review of the existing literature –including scholarly articles and relevant grey lit- erature –was conducted to determine the factors that enhance graduates ’chances of ﬁnding a job. The review brought to light a variety of factors, which were grouped into three categories: compe- tence acquisition, teaching methods and programme characteristics. We elaborate on each of these pillars below. Competence development Higher education is expected to contribute to the development of a variety of complex competen- cies that enhance the stock of human capital and foster national economic well-being (Wickrama- singhe and Perera 2010 ). Although students still view higher education credentials as positioning them favourably in the labour market, graduates ’competencies have increasingly become more important than their academic credentials in the recruitment process (Succi and Canovi 2020 ). A recent study analysing 21 million job advertisements in the UK (Brown and Souto-Otero 2020 ) conﬁ rms the importance given to job readiness as opposed to showing a minimum level of attainment. Employers seek sets of personal and professional competencies that ﬁt with the requirements of the job market. In this research we use the ﬁve categories of generic
ﬁt with the requirements of the job market. In this research we use the ﬁve categories of generic competencies provided by the OEEU Barometer: technical skills related to the ﬁeld or discipline, skills and attitudes (e.g. information and communication technology skills, communication abilities, foreign languages, planning, organ-ising), systemic competencies (e.g. creativity, personal initiative, leadership, adaptability, innovation), cognitive and methodological competencies (e.g. problem-solving, analytical thinking, working under pressure), and interpersonal competencies (e.g. the ability to work in teams or in an international context, appreciation of diversity, multiculturality). As stressed in the Bologna Declaration in 1999, one of the key questions to address is how to develop a model in which curricula ensure a meaningful preparation for the labour market (Sarkaret al. 2020 ). Notwithstanding, although competencies play a key role when evaluating prospective candidates for a job oﬀ er, there is still limited evidence regarding which types are more decisive and in which contexts, and how they should be introduced in course curricula. Accordingly, our ﬁrst hypothesis (H1) posits that the larger the variety of competencies acquired during a master ’s pro- gramme, the higher the likelihood of ﬁnding a job sooner. Teaching methods Teaching methodologies can impact the learning process and the future employability of graduates.Various voices argue for a renewal of the teaching process (Hyun et al. 2017 ). The outdated and irre- levant curriculum in the higher education system has led to university graduates being ill-prepared(Tran 2015 ; Osmani et al. 2015 ). Teaching should go beyond pouring knowledge into a student ’s head. In this context, the use of student-centred active learning strategies is seen as an e ﬀectiveSTUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION 175
way to foster higher employment rates (Jackson and Bridgstock 2018 ,2021 ; Roderick 2019 ). Active learning and experiential learning are alternative teaching strategies that break with traditional methodologies and include practical action, either by participating or by doing, mimicking real work situations. Current pedagogical trends tend to inspire lecturers to incorporate skill development opportu- nities into curricula design. Recent studies (e.g. Kelly et al. 2019 ; Rohanai et al. 2020 ) further support the belief that active learning methods as well boosting university-industry collaboration through the teaching mission (Berbegal-Mirabent et al. 2020 ) provide students with the opportunity to apply newly learnt knowledge to practical situations, thereby simultaneously developing and rein- forcing employability skills. In line with these arguments, our second hypothesis (H2) states that stu- dents following master ’s programmes in which active learning methods have a prominent role have a greater chance of securing a job soon after graduation. To test this, we classi ﬁed teaching methods into three categories –traditional, moderate and active learning –based on the intensity of the student-centric approach. Characteristics of the programme Since the creation of the European Higher Education Area in 1999, HEIs have invested considerableresources in improving students ’employability skills by enriching academic programmes with a variety of activities. These include work-based learning experiences or internships and mobility pro- grammes, and there is widespread agreement about the unique opportunities these experiences provide to students, employers and HEIs alike (Byrne 2022 ). Internships are believed to oﬀ er an autonomous, multifaceted context for learning that fosters professional maturation (Petzold 2021 ; Wilton 2012 ). According to Bittmann and Zorn ( 2020 ), there are three main theoretical corpuses that could help explain why internships should --- hands-on activities, giving them the opportunity to learn while doing, vocalise their knowledge, and learn with and from others. A higher concentration of student-centred learning activities, in combination with social interactions (Bridgstock 2019 ), can enhance graduates ’employability. However, in order to transform traditional pedagogical practices into competence-based teaching and shift to a more student-centred approach, the higher edu-cation system must provide academic sta ﬀwith more resources, time and facilities to update their courses. Another remarkable ﬁnding is that the positive association between mobility and employment in undergraduate programmes seems to dilute, as observed by Wiers-Jenssen and Støren ( 2021 ) and Van Mol et al. ( 2021 ). Master’ s programmes are shorter than bachelor ’s programmes; thus, employers may pay little attention to international experiences. Instead, they prioritise what students havegained from the programme and how this new knowledge and/or skills can be applied. It is impor- tant to recall that master ’s programmes tend to have a higher share of foreign students. Thus, even when domestic students do not travel abroad, they have the opportunity to work in an international and multicultural environment in their home institutions. Accordingly, we argue that master ’s pro- grammes should adopt a global perspective that includes the chance to unite participants –stu- dents, professors or guest speakers –from various nationalities in the academic o ﬀerings. Such an approach will enhance the social capital of the participants, blur geographical and linguistic borders and extend their network. Additionally, our ﬁndings indicate that the eﬀ ect of job placements on student employability might not be straightforward. Several interpretations should be considered. First, companiesmight not fully capitalise on the opportunities inherent in internships. According to Di Meglioet.al (2022), only 7.6% of interns are converted to
( 2020 ), there are three main theoretical corpuses that could help explain why internships should improvelabour market outcomes. On the one hand, the human capital theory (Becker 2009 ) suggests that, given that knowledge and skills are not learnt only in educational institutions, work placementshelp students to acquire practical competencies, raising their market value. Second, according tothe signalling theory (Spence 1973 ), graduates with internships signal motivation, relevant abilities and productivity, which are positively evaluated by future employers. Finally, following the socialcapital theory and its application in higher education (Fuller et al. 2011 ), internships increase one’s social capital, and larger social networks are associated with superior labour market outcomes. In the Spanish context, internships in master ’s programmes are typically part of the study plans but tend to be optional. Spending a period abroad at a di ﬀerent university is another characteristic of academic pro- grammes. International mobility is not only a personally enriching experience, but can alsowidens career opportunities abroad and at home as an overseas quali ﬁcation does often lead to substantial labour market rewards (Brooks and Waters 2011 ).International mobility also enhances an individual’ s network and cultural and linguistic knowledge of the foreign country. Although results are inconclusive regarding the speci ﬁc value of study abroad for employment prospects (Wiers-Jenssen 2008 ; Pinto 2022 ), there is a general belief that employers tend to credit candidates who spent a period of their studies abroad because it shows that they areable to leave their comfort zones and face new challenges. In Spain, Iriondo ( 2020 ) found that in the medium term Erasmus study mobility had a positive impact on graduates ’employment prospects and resulted in them receiving salaries that were 10-12% higher than those of non-participants. In light of the above considerations, we
that were 10-12% higher than those of non-participants. In light of the above considerations, we argue that the time it takes to secure their ﬁrst job is shorter for master ’s graduates who have a mobility period during their studies (H3). Similarly, those students who bene ﬁt from an internship placement with an industry partner as part of their master ’s programme are more likely to ﬁnd a job sooner (H4).176 A. PEREZ-ENCINAS AND J.

Data and methods Context: the Spanish higher education system The focus of this study is on Spanish students who have completed a master ’s degree. Master ’s pro- grammes are at ISCED (International Standard Classi ﬁcation of Education) level 7. Their length ranges between one and two academic years (60 and 120 ECTS respectively). Candidates must hold an oﬃcial university degree to qualify for admission at this level. Universities have autonomy to design the curricula of these programmes as long as they fulﬁ l a set of requirements established by the National Agency for Quality Assessment and Accreditation (ANECA), which, in turn, arealigned with the principles set by the European Higher Education Area. Spain is an interesting case to study because universities are bridging long-term integration with the labour market (Di Meglio et al. 2022 ). In fact, Spanish graduates at master and doctoral levels have the highest employment rates at 84% and 90% employment respectively (CYD Foundation 2019 ). Sample The data come from a survey on employability run by the OEEU. We used the OEEU’ s Barometer, which analysed the employability of master ’s degree graduates who had completed their studies during the 2013/2014 academic year in Spain. It had yielded responses from 6,738 graduates from 50 Spanish public and private universities. The dataset merged the administrative records of the universities with those of a survey in which graduates were asked about their work trajectory,the training they had received, and the relationship between their training and employment. To have a complete dataset, we deleted those observations from which information of interest was missing. A ﬁnal sample of 1,672 completed records met the requirements. Measures Dependent variable The dependent variable (see Table 1) was the time it took recent master ’s graduates to get their ﬁrst job. The criteria for the selected cut-o ﬀpoints (six months and one year) follow the National Associ- ation of
for the selected cut-o ﬀpoints (six months and one year) follow the National Associ- ation of Colleges and Employers ’(NACE, 2014 ) requirements, which were adhered to for several national surveys around the world, such as the ‘UK First-destination Returns ’(see also Støren and Wiers-Jenssen 2016 ; Di Meglio et al. 2022 ). Additionally, the annual employability report executed by Adecco ( 2020 ) set the criteria as employment within six months, between six months and one year, and beyond one year. Explanatory variables Competencies . The OEEU Barometer paid special attention to a list of generic competencies that uni- versity graduates are expected to acquire. For the purpose of this study, we were interested in a question that required the participants to rate the extent to which their master ’s programmes had contributed to the development of these competencies according to a 7-point Likert scale (see Table 2). Table 1. Operationalization of the dependent variable and responses in each category. Time to employment Frequency Percentage (%) Within the ﬁrst 6 months 1,106 66.1 Between 6 months and 1 year 196 11.7 >1 year (including those that did not ﬁnd a job) 370 22.1STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION 177 --- Results The results in Table 7 suggest that the students who indicated that the master ’s programme helped them to develop interpersonal skills were less likely to remain unemployed for more than one year. The development of cognitive skills raises the probability of ﬁnding a job one year after graduation but not within the ﬁrst six months. The marginal eﬀ ects ( Table 8) contribute additional insights. For attitudes, an increase of one unit in this skill is associated with being 3.2% less likely to fall into themiddle group ( ﬁnding employment between six months and one year post-graduation) and 4.2% more likely to struggle for more than one year to ﬁnd a job. These results partially support our ﬁrst hypothesis: competence development is relevant; however, not all competencies have the same eﬀ ect. Some competencies that were believed to in ﬂuence labour market activities, such as negotiation ability or languages, are not seen to be particularly relevant in the Spanish graduate labour market. Regarding teaching methods, the results support our second hypothesis that active learning methods are crucial. The importance of introducing student-centred approaches in place ofteacher-centric methods increases students ’probabilities of ﬁnding a job sooner. Turning to programme-speci ﬁc features, no eﬀ ect was found for the variable accounting for par- ticipation in exchange or mobility programmes; thus, there was no support for hypothesis 3. Contraryto our initial intuition, when looking at the e ﬀect of internships, we found that the students who participated in work placement programmes were more likely to take longer to ﬁnd a job (>1 year). Thus, hypothesis 4 is rejected. Table 7.

Teaching method. The survey also included a question regarding the extent to which various teaching and learning methods were implemented in the respondents’ master ’s programmes. These methods were grouped into three categories (see Table 3). Traditional approaches refer to instruction modes in which students are passive recipients of knowledge from an expert. Conversely, in active learning methods, students are asked to become active agents in the learning process and to engage in diverse activities. Moderate approaches are placed in-between. To verify the suitability of these groupings, a principal component analysis was conducted. Both Bartlett ’s sphericity test ( χ2= 3133.263 with 45 degrees of freedom, p-value = 0.000) and the Kaiser- Meyer-Olkin value test (KMO = 0.728, p-value = 0.000) validated our approach. Next, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted, retaining three factors with eigenvalues greater than 1. The teaching methods were grouped according to the expected categories, with loadings greater than 0.5 in all instances.Table 2. List of competencies.

Characteristics of the programme. Two variables were included. First, we considered whether the students spent a period abroad during their master ’s(mobility ) programmes. Second, we distin- guished between programmes that included a training period in a company ( internship ) and those that did not. These two variables were coded as dummy variables (1 if yes, 0 otherwise). Control variables. We included a variable ( performance ) capturing the students ’levels of attain- ment. Unfortunately, the Barometer did not include students ’numerical grades, but rather distin- guished between students who were graded with a pass (coded as 1), very good (2) or honours (3). We also controlled for potential di ﬀerences due to gender (1 males, 0 females), studying and working ( study&work ) simultaneously (1 if yes, otherwise 0), and the ownership of the university in which the students were enrolled (1 public, 0 private). Moreover, we included a categorical variableto diﬀerentiate areas of knowledge ( discipline ). Table 4 contains the descriptive statics of all these variables. Methodology Scale validation Ourﬁrst step involved testing the suitability of the competence groupings in the categories listed in Table 2 as this classi ﬁcation was proposed in the Barometer and we did not ﬁnd any empirical analy- sis verifying the validity of this approach. We analysed the unidimensionality of each factor. In allinstances, the analysis extracted only one factor, corroborating the adequacy of the approach (see Table 5). Both the Cronbach ’s alpha and the composite reliability (CR) exceeded the cut-o ﬀpoint of 0.7, indicating good internal consistency. The average variance extracted (AVE) also exceeded the recommended threshold (>0.5) for all the factors. The analysis of the discriminant validity con ﬁrmed the suitability of these factors. Table 6 shows the correlation matrix, in which the square root of each of the AVEs –shown in italics on the diagonal –was greater than the elements --- square root of each of the AVEs –shown in italics on the diagonal –was greater than the elements outside the diagonal. The only exception was interpersonal compe- tencies, which showed some overlap with systemic and cognitive skills. Thus, while the grouping was correct and served the purposes of this study, future researchers are advised to revise the instrument that captures this information. This is a limitation of this study but, as noted by Heckman ( 2000 ), some skills are not yet well captured by standardised scales. Given that the OEEU study was the only survey capturing this sort of data at a national level, we decided to proceed with the analysis. Multinomial logit To correctly test the hypotheses, we used a multinomial logit estimated by the maximum likelihoodmethod, as shown in Equation [1]: Pr(Y i=k)=ebjXi ∑ j=0ebjXi(1) where k(k=0, 1, 2) refers to the situations under analysis: ﬁnding a job within the ﬁrst six monthsTable 4.

Finally, the control variables revealed no di ﬀerences due to gender, but a signi ﬁcant eﬀ ect was found for the variable study&work . A simultaneous combination of study and work was more com- monly found for students who found a job within the ﬁrst six months after graduation. Concerning university ownership, a short unemployment period was more likely for graduates who had attended a private university. However, this eﬀ ect was weak. When distinguishing by level of accomplishment, the results indicated that the students who performed well (grading: very good) were more likely to ﬁnd a job between the ﬁrst six months to one year after graduating. Similarly, excellent students were negatively associated with long periods of unemployment. In terms of ﬁeld of study, the engin- eering students were less likely to be without employment for more than one year. Given that the results were quite similar between groups 2 and 3 we carried out a robustness check to further investigate potential di ﬀerences in employment opportunities for students in these groups. In brief, the ﬁndings obtained with this new con ﬁguration do not di ﬀer signi ﬁcantly from the results already reported. The full results are reported in the Appendix. Discussion and implications HEIs are becoming increasingly more concerned with the integration of their graduates into the labour market and with designing institutional mechanisms to facilitate students ’transition from higher education to the job market (Silva et al. 2016 ). While this phenomenon has been largely docu- mented in the literature, previous research eﬀ orts have overlooked the role that HEIs play in this process. With a view to ﬁlling this gap, this study comprises an examination of how the structure and the content of university master ’s programmes in ﬂuence the time it takes for master ’s degree graduates to obtain their ﬁrst job. By doing so, we go beyond the monolithic discourses that tend to dominate public debates and limit the --- for future research. We are aware that the absence of these controls in ourstudy constitutes an important shortcoming. However, given the uniqueness of this dataset and the lack of studies at master ’s level, we believe our approach captures, with the highest possible level of accuracy, the situation of master ’s graduates who are seeking their ﬁrst job. Another direc- tion for future research involves analysing the e ﬀect of work-based learning experiences abroad and at multinational companies. Finally, knowing more about the pro ﬁle of graduates who require more than one year to get a job is a matter of interest for policymakers and education leaders. Unfortu- nately, the limited data did not allow for this type of analysis. Therefore, future researchers might184 A. PEREZ-ENCINAS AND J. BERBEGAL-MIRABENT
doing so, we go beyond the monolithic discourses that tend to dominate public debates and limit the study of employability to skills development. Similar to Jackson and Bridgstock ( 2021 ), we acknowledge the relevance of skill acquisition, but we also broaden the concept of employability to other dimensions.Table 8.

PEREZ-ENCINAS AND J. BERBEGAL-MIRABENT
Our results have several implications for managerial considerations. First, they suggest that skill acquisition –measured in terms of self-appraisal –has low predictive power in relation to employ- ment. Among the various skills categories, cognitive and systemic skills were found to play a role, albeit in opposite directions, while interpersonal skills appeared to be more important at work than cognitive competencies (also seen in Salas-Velasco ( 2014 ) and Petzold ( 2021 )). These ﬁndings call into question the eﬀ ectiveness of competence development at HEIs to facilitate stu- dents ’transition from university to the workforce. In Spain, as in many other countries, the higher education system is still largely focused on the provision of technical knowledge. A clear exampleis found in the indicators used to assess students ’performance, most of which are designed to evalu- ate the acquisition of knowledge rather than the students ’experience and skill development. While knowing and understanding the principles of a discipline are fundamental, one cannot underesti-mate the importance of the progressive demand for non-technical skills. The main challenge lies in how to adequately balance technical and non-technical skills in curricula and provide a variety of learning activities that promote social connectedness (Bridgstock 2019 ). Although universities are increasingly encouraging their teachers to update their practices, the system is still oriented to the long tradition of professor-centred approaches. The Covid-19 pandemichas accelerated this debate and moved education forward to a new paradigm of teaching. Our studyprovides evidence that active learning methods do make a di ﬀerence, complementing the works of Jackson and Bridgstock ( 2021 ), Kelly et al. ( 2019 ) and Rohanai et al. ( 2020 ). Thus, it is imperative to enrich students ’learning experiences with more hands-on activities, giving them the opportunity to learn while doing, vocalise their knowledge,
inherent in internships. According to Di Meglioet.al (2022), only 7.6% of interns are converted to fulltime employees by the companies at which they did their internships. Likewise, data from the Servicio Público de Empleo Estatal platform in 2019 indicate that only three out of 10 student interns are hired full-time by the company following their internships. Although the goal should be to make full-time hires from interns, various factors might prevent them from doing so (e.g. there are no full-time positions open at that time or thecompany cannot a ﬀord to hire them). An alternative explanation relates to the human and signalling theories. Work experience obtained through internships contributes to raise graduates ’market value. However, the oﬀ er is limited, and one might observe a mismatch between graduates ’expec- tations of their ﬁrst jobs and what companies are looking for, resulting in a situation of overquali ﬁca- tion (Livanos 2010 ). A third explanation is that the master ’s programme might be seen as mandatorySTUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION 183
step for career trajectories, such as students who intend to pursue doctoral degrees having to ﬁrst complete a master ’s programme or workers enrolled in upskilling programmes in their companies. In the latter case, master ’s students already have a job before starting their master ’s programme (CYD Foundation 2019 ). Consequently, once they graduate, they return to their company, bene ﬁting from the new knowledge and skills acquired. This is a fairly common practice in certain disciplines with a high labour insertion rate in Spain. Fourth, it is relevant to question whether the typology of the internship plays a role. Voluntary or extracurricular internships have been found to display highly signiﬁcant positive eﬀ ects in relation to labour market outcomes (Jackson 2018 ), yet, no e ﬀects were observed for mandatory internships (Bittmann and Zorn 2020 ). Unfortunately, our data did not contain information concerning voluntary internships; therefore, our results should be inter-preted with caution. We encourage further studies to be conducted in this direction as one of theselling points of master ’s programmes is the inclusion of job placements as a bridge to stable employment. Finally, there are three additional characteristics that deserve attention. Students from private universities seem to be in an advantageous position compared to those attending public universities because the time between graduation and employment is more likely to be shorter for them. O ﬃcial statistics support this ﬁnding (Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades 2019 ). A similar pattern was observed for engineering students, who typically found a job sooner (<1 year). Thisresult is also unsurprising because engineering skills are among the most in demand in Spain (CYD Foundation 2019 ; Adecco 2020 ). Students in the experimental sciences are more likely to ﬁnd a job in six to 12 months after completing their master ’s degrees. Similar results for engineering students and those
months after completing their master ’s degrees. Similar results for engineering students and those in the experimental sciences were found by Livanos ( 2010 ). Finally, when control- ling for the simultaneous eﬀ ect of working and studying, we observed that this combination had a positive eﬀ ect, suggesting that students either keep their jobs once they ﬁnish their master ’s pro- grammes or that this working experience has helped them to develop networks within theirchosen industries (as explained by both the social capital and signalling theories). Concluding remarks This study interrogates the extent to which the structure and content of university programmes play a role in preparing graduates to enter the workforce. We analysed the impact of competence devel- opment, teaching methods and programme characteristics on the employment probabilities ofmaster ’s degree graduates at three points of time. The empirical analysis was based on a large- scale national survey in Spain. Our results are subject to a number caveats that should be acknowledged. First, our database comprised detailed information about master ’s degree graduates in a given coutnry. To guarantee the respondents ’anonymity, the survey did not solicit any information concerning the universities attended, with the only exception of university ownership. Moreover, there was no informationabout territory; consequently, we cannot infer from which university (or region) students graduated. While controls such as the characteristics of the region, status, prestige and size of the university might provide relevant insights concerning employers ’recruitment practices and students ’mobility decisions, the existing surveys seem to have neglected the importance of collecting such infor- mation. Likewise, the inclusion of personal and psychological attributes or contextual factors consti- tute a promising area for future research. We are aware that the absence of these controls in ourstudy constitutes an
consider collecting data in a more comprehensive way, which might, in turn, require qualitative tech- niques for the analysis. All in all, we believe the outputs of this study can assist educators, policymakers and employers to make more informed decisions about course design and the type of university-industry partnershipsrequired to ensure that graduates are equipped with the right skills, knowledge and tools to securejobs. The results might also be valuable for graduate students because they point to some speci ﬁc characteristics of academic programmes that should be considered when looking for a master ’s programme.

Appendix Using the available data, it is feasible to di ﬀerentiate between di ﬀerent groups of students based on the length of the post-graduation unemployment period. These groups are mutually exclusive, and a student cannot be classi ﬁed in more than one group. To further corroborate di ﬀerences between groups, we scrutinized the existence of potential diﬀerences between students in group 2 (between six months and one year to ﬁnd a job) and group 3 (more than one year of unemployment) using the independent of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) test. The IIA test assumes that the characteristics of a chosen alternative do not impact the relative probabilities of choos- ing other alternatives. In our context, its application allows us to verify whether omitting categories in the dependent variable yields to more consistent and e ﬃcient parameter estimates (Hausman and McFadden 1984 ). More speci ﬁcally, the null hypothesis is that all coe ﬃcients of the estimated parameters are equal for students in groups 2 and 3; con- sequently, students in these two groups may be analyzed together. The underlying reasoning behind this assumption is that some of the most relevant reports in this ﬁeld in Spain1tend to either not report on more than two groups (less than or more than six months to ﬁnd employment) or found no relevant characteristics to explain di ﬀerences in employment beyond the six-month timeframe. The Hausman test was calculated as shown in Equation (3 ), where sdenotes the
six-month timeframe. The Hausman test was calculated as shown in Equation (3 ), where sdenotes the estimator obtained with the restricted model and fthe estimator obtained with the model using the set of all possible alternatives. ˆVsandˆVfare the estimators of the asymptotic covariance matrices. x2=(ˆbs−ˆbf)′[ˆVs−ˆVf]−1(ˆbs−ˆbf) (3) The results are displayed in Table A1 and indicate that ˆbs−ˆbf=0 both when category 2 (employment between six months and one year after graduation) and 3 (more than one year of unemployment) are eliminated in the restricted models. Accordingly, in line with our initial prediction, these two categories can be merged into one group (more than six months to ﬁnd a job) since no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences are observed in the estimated parameters (see Table A1 ). Con- sequently, a Logit and Tobit model were preferred for the analysis. The new results are reported in Table A2 and operationalize the dependent variable as a dichotomous variable with the value of 1 if the length of post-graduation unemployment is no longer than six months; 0 is used for all other constellations.

chances of getting a job sooner. No signi ﬁ- cant e ﬀect is found for the other competencies investigated. Regarding teaching methods, the use of active learning approaches is linked to a reduced unemployment period. With relation to the speci ﬁc characteristics of the master ’s programme, both models provide additional evidence of the negative e ﬀect of completing an internship on ﬁnding a job, whereas —similarly to the multinomial logit model —simultaneously studying and working reduces the length of unemployment. Contrary to the previous analysis, the level of students ’achievement seems to be irrelevant to explaining post- graduation unemployment length; this absence of signi ﬁcance is consistent in both the Logit and Tobit models. This result re ﬂects the reality of the Spanish context (compared to other countries such as Italy), in which students ’ﬁnal score obtained at graduation is rarely included on CVs or in job interviews. Lastly, students who completed their master ’s at a private university seem to have better chances of ﬁnding a job sooner than those at public universities, although this association is only signi ﬁcant in the Logit model.188 A.

Results from a national survey of master’s graduates" de Adriana Perez-Encinas y Jasmina Berbegal-Mirabent, publicado en *Studies in Higher Education*, investiga el tiempo que tardan los graduados de programas de maestría en encontrar empleo en España, analizando factores que influyen en esta inserción laboral. La investigación se basa en una encuesta nacional que incluye a 6,738 graduados de 50 universidades, de los cuales se seleccionaron 1,672 registros completos para el análisis.

### Objetivos y Metodología
Los autores se centran en tres dimensiones clave: la adquisición de competencias, los métodos de enseñanza y las características del programa. Utilizan un modelo logit multinomial para identificar factores que afectan la probabilidad de conseguir empleo en diferentes plazos: menos de seis meses, entre seis meses y un año, y más de un año. Se examinan variables como el campo de estudio, la experiencia laboral previa y las características demográficas de los graduados.

### Resultados Clave
1. **Competencias**: 
   - Las competencias interpersonales y sistémicas se asocian positivamente con la rapidez en la obtención de empleo, mientras que las competencias cognitivas tienen un efecto negativo significativo en el corto plazo.
   - Las habilidades técnicas y de actitud no muestran efectos significativos en la inserción laboral.

2. **Métodos de Enseñanza**: 
   - Los enfoques de aprendizaje activo están relacionados con una mayor probabilidad de conseguir empleo rápidamente, en contraste con los métodos tradicionales, que no muestran efectos significativos.

3. **Características del Programa**: 
   - La participación en prácticas laborales se asocia con un aumento en el tiempo de desempleo, lo que sugiere que las prácticas no siempre conducen a una inserción laboral más rápida.
   - Los graduados de universidades privadas tienden a encontrar empleo más rápidamente que aquellos de universidades públicas.

4. **Variables de Control**: 
   - El rendimiento académico no tiene un impacto significativo en la duración del desempleo, lo que contrasta con hallazgos en otros contextos.
   - Los graduados que trabajan y estudian simultáneamente tienen mejores oportunidades de empleo.

### Implicaciones
Los hallazgos sugieren que las universidades deben adaptar sus programas para incluir más competencias interpersonales y métodos de enseñanza activos, así como considerar la estructura de las prácticas laborales. Además, se destaca la necesidad de que las instituciones de educación superior se alineen más con las demandas del mercado laboral para mejorar la empleabilidad de sus graduados.

### Limitaciones y Direcciones Futuras
Los autores reconocen limitaciones en la recopilación de datos, como la falta de información sobre la región de procedencia de los graduados y la necesidad de incluir variables personales y contextuales en futuros estudios. Se sugiere investigar más sobre la movilidad internacional y su impacto en la empleabilidad.

### Conclusión
El estudio proporciona una visión integral sobre cómo las características de los programas de maestría y las competencias adquiridas influyen en la inserción laboral de los graduados en España, subrayando la importancia de la educación superior en la preparación de los estudiantes para el mercado laboral actual.
