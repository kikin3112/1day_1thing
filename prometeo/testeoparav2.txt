Resilient Structures and Sustainable Construction   Edited  by Pellicer , E., Adam, J. M., Yepes, V., Singh, A ., and Yazdani, S.   Copyright © 2017  ISEC Press   ISBN: 978 -0-9960437 -4-8  1  LEADERSHIP AND COLLABORATION IN  PROJECT MANAGEMENT EDUCATION:    A CASE STUDY   SILVIA MAZZETTO  Dept of Architecture and Urban Planning , Qatar University, Doha, Qatar     This paper discusses about the importance of practic al experience and multidisciplinary  collaboration in project management success and the apparent lack of emphasis placed  on this within the context of university education.   It introduces a multidisciplinary  approach currently being implemented in the College of Engineering in Qatar  University b etween the departments of Architecture and Urban Planning and Industrial  and Systems Engineering.  The research items cover specific areas of collaboration and  leadership in project management and the collected data was then analyzed to compare  Architectur e and Engineering students in their approach to the multidisciplinary project  and in the proper application of managerial tools for planning scope, time, cost and risk  managements through integration, technology and communication.   The paper provides  strategies of effective practices applied for embedding enterprise and employability in  higher education, in respect to the specific project experiences that are mandatory for  each project manager.   The students’ outcomes demonstrate their ability to recognize  the dialectic relationship between project management and the multidisciplinary  approach to recognize the diversity of roles, needs, values, tools, as they relate their  experience to the current environment for project management in Qatar.  In other  words,  the question is:  can the multidisciplinary collaboration, applied in higher  education, enhance the interac tion between theory and practic al experience in a field  mainly dominated by the theoretical approaches of different
and practic al experience in a field  mainly dominated by the theoretical approaches of different disciplines?

The complexity of interactions between different multidisciplinary  disciplines and multi cultural teams, which generates conflicts and competition into the  managerial procedures, can affect the integration between foreign managers, local clients and  international partners.   A number of authors have called for more attention to be paid in the  impact of multidisciplinary collaboration on project management processes.  The literature  indicates that different disciplines can influence a variety of project management issues such as:  teams (Binder  2010) , leadershi p (De Bony 2010) , communication, risk  assessment (Zwikael and  Ahn 2011) , business negotiations (Hurn  2007) , international project management (Lane et al.   2005)  and planning (Zwikael  2009) .  In Qatar,  there are many projects which are performed in
Pellicer, E.,  Adam, J. M., Yepes, V., Singh, A. , and Yazdani, S.  (eds.)   2 multidisciplinary collaboration with internati onal construction companies and consultants where a  correct managerial approach is fundamental for the successful completion.  Qatar is open to  foreign companies  but large and complex projects are often performed in  collaboration with local  partners.  Obvi ously,  there are likely to be many different multidisciplinary approaches and  cultural differences between them. For the success of these initiatives the project managers face  numerous challenges (Thoms and Pinto 1999) , which include multidisciplinary fact ors such as  managing mixed teams pertaining to different disciplines.   Specifically, how does the  multidisciplinary approach influence project managers' perceptions and utilization of managerial  tools?   Professionalism starts at the first steps of students ’ education in the university where the  disciplines and their implication starts to model and to affect the student’s attitude and behavior,  while they are working in collaboration in multidisciplinary team.  Can the multidisciplinary  collaboration, applie d in higher education, enhance the interac tion between theory and practic al  experience in a field mainly dominated by the theoretical approaches of different disciplines?     2 METHODS AND OBJECTIVES   2.1    The Multidi sciplinary Research Project   The multidiscipl inary research, developed in the College of Engineering in Qatar University,  presents a pragmatic synthesis of field experiences which establishes the relationship, similarities  and differences between theory and practice in project management (Gray and La rson 2002)  and  subsequently draws comparisons of the practices relevant to reduce the lack existing between  theoretical approach and practic al experience in the field.

the  implications of unawareness and lack of understandin g that can affect the effective  implementation of project management practice in the Qatar construction environment.   The case study approach, used in the present research, provides students with “real -project”  experiences in which students can apply their  knowledge and expertise in order to enhance their  employability.   The approach performs an intensive analysis of an individual work unit, stressing  developmental factors in relation to context.  Two other approaches were initially considered for  use in th e present study, although neither was ultimately selected.  The first of these, the Action  Research approach (Lewin  1946)  is a participatory process concerned with developing practical  knowledge. The second, known as Work -Based Learning methodology (WBL) (Garavan  and  O′Cinneide  1994) , is used  to reinforce elements in Vocational Educational and T raining (VET)  (EU's C harter of Fundamental Rights  2013 ).  The reason that the case study approach was  selected here was that it seemed best suited to the context and circumstances prevailing in the  College of Engineering at Qatar University, where there is a great deal of mult idisciplinary  collaboration, that strongly contributes to ensures that the hard and soft skills young students  acquire are those needed on the labor  market.  The multidisciplinary research project has been  proposed and developed to involve students and ins tructors specializing in diverse disciplines and  aspects of Architecture and Urban Planning (AUP) and Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE).   The intention was to get them to focus on a common assignment as part of their courses, using the  tools of proj ect management (Project Management Institute (PMI)  2008)  to investigate and  develop the students’ capabilities and attitudes when working in a multidisciplinary team to  successful complete the assigned project.   The research describes the primary
team to  successful complete the assigned project.   The research describes the primary components  of the theoretical approach including course  program in Construction and Project Management, the integration with other courses, the  cooperation required to support the multidisciplinary emphasis, and the establishment of an  innovative academic collaborat ion to provide a technological infrastructure for supporting the  program goals.   The research project was linked to the Qatar Road Safety Studies Center
Resilient Structures and Sustainable Construction     3 (QRSSC), which is a prominent research center in Qatar.  The multidisciplinary project title was  “Proje ct Management tools and techniques for the development of a multidisciplinary project on  Road Safety in Qatar”.  The project involved a total number of 76 Engineering students  both from  the Department of Architecture and Urban Planning ( AUP) attending  the course ACRT 530  Construction and Project Manage ment and from the Department of  Industrial and Systems  Engineering ( ISE) attending the course IENG 481 Project Engineering) for the Fall 2015.  During  the semester,  the students were requested to apply the pro ject management tools and techniques,  working in groups of students, demonstrating their leadership among the group members and  using multidisciplinary approaches in order to submit their project deliverables.   The  multidisciplinary project outcomes were l inked to the message of increasing road safety  awareness in Qatar.  Across the world almost 1.3 million people die as a result of a road traffic  crash each year, it means 3,500 deaths every day.  The Qatar National  Road Safety Strategy  2013 -2022  (NRSS  2013 ) has been developed to reduce the human suffering inflicted by road  traffic crashes and sets the path towards an ambitious long-term vision to promote a safe road  transport system.     2.2    Road Safety Management   During the course,  the students applied th e tools of Project Management, within their  multidisciplinary groups and they selected some research topics which pertained to the effective  road safety management.   The aim was to providing results focus, project coordination, research  analysis, monitorin g and evaluation of the safety status in Qatar, advocacy in rising the safety  awareness, knowledge transfer among new generation and improvement in crash understanding in  order to avoid accidents .  The most selected topics for the students’ researches were
in  order to avoid accidents .  The most selected topics for the students’ researches were  linked to the  followings:    SAFE ROADS:   Roads that are self -explaining and forgiving of mistakes to reduce the  risk of crashes  occurring and to protect road users from fatal or serious injury.  This  requires roads and roadsides to be designed, built and m aintained to reduce the risk and  severity of crashes.    SAFE VEHICLES:   Safe vehicles that prevent crashes and protect road users supported  by minimum safety standards, inspections and public desire for safer vehicles, trough  latest safety features and techn ologies (e.g. seatbelts in all seating locations, multiple  airbags, stability control programs, advanced braking systems).    SAFE SPEEDS:   Vehicles travel at speeds that suit the function and the level of safety of  the road to  ensure that crash forces are ke pt below the limits that cause death or serious  injury.   This requires the setting of appropriate speed limits supplemented by  enforcement and education.    SAFE ROAD USERS:  Road users which are competent and compliant with traffic laws.   This includes  road user education, managing the licensing of drivers and taking action  against those who break the rules.     2.3    Raising Awareness and I mproving Knowledge   The main goal of the multidisciplinary research project was to increase the public awareness in  Qatar t owards how road safety is a truly significant matter, in terms of roads safety, vehicle  safety, speed safety and people safety which are related with the road regulations.   Road safety is  a relatively new topic for Qatar and so there were limited informati on on what measures the
Pellicer, E.,  Adam, J. M., Yepes, V., Singh, A. , and Yazdani, S.  (eds.)   4 actual condition of safety.  The diverse nationalities using roads in Qatar and the road designs in  use in the country could mean that research from elsewhere in the world is not directly applicable.    Building an evidence base that provides a detailed understanding of road user behavior can  take decades  of research and development; however,  it is important that campaigns appeal to road  users and messages are translated into behavioral change.  For example, understanding why  people us e mobile phones while driving and their attitude towards safety will help to shape the  campaigns to combat this dangerous behavior.   Crash data in Qatar were collected from the  students by the Traffic Police Department and entered into a database for the p roject analysis.   Although the data collected by the police suit the students ’ analysis and groups researches, the  collection of more additional information related to the scene of a crash, would probably help  other stakeholders to plan their work more eff ectively.  At present, there are no formal protocols  for the sharing of data with the wider stakeholder community who would benefit from using such  data to identify priorities and inform the development of road safety interventions.  In addition,  the resea rch project aimed to investigate any matter related to the road layout and proposed a re - design of the main dangerous selected areas in Doha and in Qatar in order to meet the required  road safety measures.  The students highlight the value and importance o f designing in  accordance with the international and local codes and regulations, however, when it comes to  road safety, several additions need  to be considered to ensure the minimum safety requirements  and the expected variations of users’  behaviors.       2.4    The Methodology for a M ultidi sciplinary Collaboration:  Data C ollection   The students started their project
for a M ultidi sciplinary Collaboration:  Data C ollection   The students started their project with collaborative and coordinated activities to monitor the  current status of road safety awareness in Qatar.  Instructors provided course del ivery to both  groups of students through readings, educational audio and video course assignments and  integrated multidisciplinary coordinated lectures delivered during the course.  From the initial  phase of the selected sites and data analyses, students d eveloped the project reports starting from  the description of each character , pertaining to the selected area of analysis.   The students agreed  their project title and the group name. They coordinated their activities planning the phases of  project develop ment which have been discussed and implemented during the multidisciplinary  meetings. The discussed decisions have been officially approved by the filled minutes of meeting  format, reporting the multidisciplinary collaboration between students, the project ’s objectives,  the methodology and scope of the students’ work while they were managing their projects.     2.5    Managerial Tools and Progress of the W ork:  Data A nalysis   A research method and templates were used to enhance the students’ multidisciplinary projects  and data collections, such as a report template, a minute o f meeting and a poster template  which  were disseminate among the students.   All the deliverables were expected to show the students’  ability to understand the basic principles of project a nd practice management, project costs and  budget estimations, project activity scheduling, capability to allocate resources, to demonstrate  understanding and the appropriate use of correct methods for evaluating and controlling their  projects.   Starting fr om the financial considerations regarding the fundamentals of building costs,  such as financial feasibility, costs estimation with an emphasis on life -cycle cost accounting,  students
financial feasibility, costs estimation with an emphasis on life -cycle cost accounting,  students demonstrated their ability to use the basic principles of architectural p ractice  management such as project planning, time management, risk management, mediation and  arbitration and recognized trends that affect practice, including selection of consultants and  assembling teams and recommended project delivery methods.  Finally,  the students were  requested to provide recommendations after the project completion demonstrating their ability to
Resilient Structures and Sustainable Construction     5 recognize the dialectic relationship between people and the built environment in the GCC/Arab  region and to recognize diversity of needs, va lues, behavioral norms, and social patterns as they  related to the creation of the road safe built environment.   The students demonstrated their  knowledge regarding the professional and legal responsibilities in font to the public and the  clients as determ ined by the registration law, which is an important professional achievement,  demonstrating their understanding of the building codes and regulations, the professional service  contracts, zoning and subdivision ordinances, environmental regulations, and acc essibility laws.     3 DISCUSSION AND RESULTS   Linking the multidisciplinary research with the students’ projects outcomes was problematic due  to the requested changes in the assessment processes and numerous factors concerned with the  differences among the col laborative courses pertaining to two different departments in the  College of Engineering. In term of complexity the multidisciplinary project was complicated  since a lot of efforts were needed between the groups of students in planning, coordinating and  controlling their projects .  There were two types of success criteria considered in the assessment  process: first one was the project management success criterion that was related to the students’  ability to apply professional practice methods and running th eir project using the appropriate  managerial tools and techniques. In particular dedicated rubrics were developed to assess the  students’ capability to complete the project on time, to overcome any delays that may occur  during the progress of the project, and get approvals for the submitted drawings and documents.  The second type was the projects’ deliverable success criteria that were related to the projects  outcomes as a result of the students’ project research. The first part was
related to the projects  outcomes as a result of the students’ project research. The first part was successfully completed  by all the groups of students but the second one was partially incomplete and still enhancements  and implementations were requested order to achieve acceptable and comparable level of results  that can be further investigated.  Many groups of students collab oratively have interacted for the  whole duration of the project, demonstrating their ability to work in multidisciplinary teams to  successfully complete the projects related to Qatar road safety .  Particularly the videos submitted  to the  Qatar Road Safety Studies Center (QRSSC) addressed a number of interesting topics such  as raising awareness about the danger of speeding on the road, the importance of wearing safety  belt, the importance of using baby car seat (booster) and any other case, as long as it is relevant  and useful to road safety in Qatar. All the submitted videos were original, not including pictures  or videos from any other sources and they were completely shot in Qatar.  The group of students  proposed the following actions for raising the road safety awareness and improving knowledge  among road users and practitioners as for the following:    Share available information on accident  to identify priorities    Collect and manage additional data for analysis using special software’s    Develop road safety ed ucation in schools with specific campaigns to educate youth  generation    Work with community, to promote road safety messages based in the video developed by  the students    Propose a homogenous road section  in the redesign of the road    Create a sustainable saf e road network: separate vehicle type s, reduce speed at potential  conflict points
Pellicer, E.,  Adam, J. M., Yepes, V., Singh, A. , and Yazdani, S.  (eds.)   6  Develop additional researches to understand road safety problems and attitudes in more  detail.     4 CONCLUSION   Figures are to be inserted into the text nearest its first referenc e, and must be referred to within  the body of the text preferably before the figure appears. In this paper,  we have set out to show  how the multidisciplinary collaboration between different department and innovative research  approaches can enhance the road  safety awareness in Qatar.  We have described one method  currently being in Qatar Unive rsity for enhancing the practic al experience in project management  education. We also have described some of the issues which have arisen in developing this  innovative r esearch approach with the aim to enhance the students’ leadership within the  collaborative groups. In giving this partial view of a complex, long -term project it is not possible  to describe the processes of evaluation and the outcomes of the project in mor e detail, some  aspects of evaluation have been referred to briefly and the principle outcomes, in scientific terms,  have to be implemented with additional researches In this project the managerial tools used by  students to develop their project activities and the final outcomes are similar to those which might  been encountered in normal professional practice .  As already pointed out, the students working  as a researcher rather than professional practitioner, had the opportunity to use their skills to  repres ent and develop some hypothetical proposition in a form which are widely accessible and  suitable for many forms of evaluation.  Drawing upon collaboration and leadership, the research  concludes that the efficiency of interaction between theory and practice  in education and in  construction industry needs to be further examined, and the project management and control  practices used in theory are worth being explored in
and the project management and control  practices used in theory are worth being explored in practice.

From the initial  phase of the selected sites and data analyses, students d eveloped the project reports starting from  the description of each character , pertaining to the selected area of analysis.   The students agreed  their project title and the group name. They coordinated their activities planning the phases of  project develop ment which have been discussed and implemented during the multidisciplinary  meetings. The discussed decisions have been officially approved by the filled minutes of meeting  format, reporting the multidisciplinary collaboration between students, the project ’s objectives,  the methodology and scope of the students’ work while they were managing their projects.     2.5    Managerial Tools and Progress of the W ork:  Data A nalysis   A research method and templates were used to enhance the students’ multidisciplinary projects  and data collections, such as a report template, a minute o f meeting and a poster template  which  were disseminate among the students.   All the deliverables were expected to show the students’  ability to understand the basic principles of project a nd practice management, project costs and  budget estimations, project activity scheduling, capability to allocate resources, to demonstrate  understanding and the appropriate use of correct methods for evaluating and controlling their  projects.   Starting fr om the financial considerations regarding the fundamentals of building costs,  such as financial feasibility, costs estimation with an emphasis on life -cycle cost accounting,  students
financial feasibility, costs estimation with an emphasis on life -cycle cost accounting,  students demonstrated their ability to use the basic principles of architectural p ractice  management such as project planning, time management, risk management, mediation and  arbitration and recognized trends that affect practice, including selection of consultants and  assembling teams and recommended project delivery methods.  Finally,  the students were  requested to provide recommendations after the project completion demonstrating their ability to --- Resilient Structures and Sustainable Construction     5 recognize the dialectic relationship between people and the built environment in the GCC/Arab  region and to recognize diversity of needs, va lues, behavioral norms, and social patterns as they  related to the creation of the road safe built environment.   The students demonstrated their  knowledge regarding the professional and legal responsibilities in font to the public and the  clients as determ ined by the registration law, which is an important professional achievement,  demonstrating their understanding of the building codes and regulations, the professional service  contracts, zoning and subdivision ordinances, environmental regulations, and acc essibility laws.     3 DISCUSSION AND RESULTS   Linking the multidisciplinary research with the students’ projects outcomes was problematic due  to the requested changes in the assessment processes and numerous factors concerned with the  differences among the col laborative courses pertaining to two different departments in the  College of Engineering. In term of complexity the multidisciplinary project was complicated  since a lot of efforts were needed between the groups of students in planning, coordinating and  controlling their projects .  There were two types of success criteria considered in the assessment  process: first one was the project management success criterion that was related to the students’  ability to apply professional practice methods and running th eir project using the appropriate  managerial tools and techniques. In particular dedicated rubrics were developed to assess the  students’ capability to complete the project on time, to overcome any delays that may occur  during the progress of the project, and get approvals for the submitted drawings and documents.  The second type was the projects’ deliverable success criteria that were related to the projects  outcomes as a result of the students’ project research. The first part was
related to the projects  outcomes as a result of the students’ project research. The first part was successfully completed  by all the groups of students but the second one was partially incomplete and still enhancements  and implementations were requested order to achieve acceptable and comparable level of results  that can be further investigated.  Many groups of students collab oratively have interacted for the  whole duration of the project, demonstrating their ability to work in multidisciplinary teams to  successfully complete the projects related to Qatar road safety .  Particularly the videos submitted  to the  Qatar Road Safety Studies Center (QRSSC) addressed a number of interesting topics such  as raising awareness about the danger of speeding on the road, the importance of wearing safety  belt, the importance of using baby car seat (booster) and any other case, as long as it is relevant  and useful to road safety in Qatar. All the submitted videos were original, not including pictures  or videos from any other sources and they were completely shot in Qatar.  The group of students  proposed the following actions for raising the road safety awareness and improving knowledge  among road users and practitioners as for the following:    Share available information on accident  to identify priorities    Collect and manage additional data for analysis using special software’s    Develop road safety ed ucation in schools with specific campaigns to educate youth  generation    Work with community, to promote road safety messages based in the video developed by  the students    Propose a homogenous road section  in the redesign of the road    Create a sustainable saf e road network: separate vehicle type s, reduce speed at potential  conflict points
Pellicer, E.,  Adam, J. M., Yepes, V., Singh, A. , and Yazdani, S.  (eds.)   6  Develop additional researches to understand road safety problems and attitudes in more  detail.     4 CONCLUSION   Figures are to be inserted into the text nearest its first referenc e, and must be referred to within  the body of the text preferably before the figure appears. In this paper,  we have set out to show  how the multidisciplinary collaboration between different department and innovative research  approaches can enhance the road  safety awareness in Qatar.  We have described one method  currently being in Qatar Unive rsity for enhancing the practic al experience in project management  education. We also have described some of the issues which have arisen in developing this  innovative r esearch approach with the aim to enhance the students’ leadership within the  collaborative groups. In giving this partial view of a complex, long -term project it is not possible  to describe the processes of evaluation and the outcomes of the project in mor e detail, some  aspects of evaluation have been referred to briefly and the principle outcomes, in scientific terms,  have to be implemented with additional researches In this project the managerial tools used by  students to develop their project activities and the final outcomes are similar to those which might  been encountered in normal professional practice .  As already pointed out, the students working  as a researcher rather than professional practitioner, had the opportunity to use their skills to  repres ent and develop some hypothetical proposition in a form which are widely accessible and  suitable for many forms of evaluation.  Drawing upon collaboration and leadership, the research  concludes that the efficiency of interaction between theory and practice  in education and in  construction industry needs to be further examined, and the project management and control  practices used in theory are worth being explored in
and the project management and control  practices used in theory are worth being explored in practice.

El texto "Resilient Structures and Sustainable Construction", editado por Pellicer, Adam, Yepes, Singh y Yazdani, incluye un capítulo titulado "Leadership and Collaboration in Project Management Education: A Case Study", escrito por Silvia Mazzetto de la Universidad de Qatar. Este capítulo se centra en la relevancia de la experiencia práctica y la colaboración multidisciplinaria en la gestión de proyectos, subrayando la insuficiente atención que se presta a estos aspectos en la educación universitaria.

Mazzetto presenta un enfoque multidisciplinario en la Universidad de Qatar, donde se colabora entre los departamentos de Arquitectura y Planificación Urbana e Ingeniería Industrial y de Sistemas. La investigación examina áreas específicas de colaboración y liderazgo en la gestión de proyectos, utilizando datos recopilados para comparar las perspectivas de estudiantes de Arquitectura e Ingeniería en un proyecto conjunto. Se evalúa la aplicación de herramientas de gestión en la planificación de alcance, tiempo, costos y gestión de riesgos, destacando la importancia de la integración, la tecnología y la comunicación.

El capítulo también propone estrategias para incorporar la formación empresarial y la empleabilidad en la educación superior, vinculando estas experiencias con las exigencias de los gerentes de proyecto. Los resultados muestran que los estudiantes son capaces de reconocer la interrelación entre la gestión de proyectos y el enfoque multidisciplinario, así como de identificar la diversidad de roles, necesidades y herramientas en el contexto actual de la gestión de proyectos en Qatar.

Se plantea la pregunta de si la colaboración multidisciplinaria en la educación superior puede mejorar la conexión entre teoría y práctica en un campo que ha sido dominado por enfoques teóricos. La investigación sugiere que esta colaboración es no solo beneficiosa, sino esencial para preparar a los estudiantes ante los desafíos del mundo real en la gestión de proyectos, especialmente en el sector de la construcción.

**Revisión de la Literatura:**

El texto argumenta que la mayoría de los proyectos de construcción involucran a personas e instituciones de diversas nacionalidades y disciplinas, lo que requiere una cooperación estrecha. Esta interacción puede generar conflictos y competencia, afectando la integración entre gerentes extranjeros, clientes locales y socios internacionales. La literatura revisada indica que la colaboración multidisciplinaria impacta en varios aspectos de la gestión de proyectos, incluyendo la dinámica de equipos, el liderazgo, la comunicación, la evaluación de riesgos, las negociaciones comerciales y la planificación.

En el contexto de Qatar, se destaca la necesidad de desarrollar herramientas gerenciales que faciliten la colaboración y la comunicación entre los diferentes actores involucrados en los proyectos. El texto enfatiza la importancia de la experiencia práctica y la colaboración multidisciplinaria, sugiriendo que una mejor comprensión de estos conceptos puede mejorar la efectividad y el éxito de los proyectos en entornos complejos.

Se menciona un proyecto de investigación multidisciplinario en la Facultad de Ingeniería de la Universidad de Qatar, que busca sintetizar experiencias de campo para establecer relaciones entre teoría y práctica en la gestión de proyectos. Este enfoque se basa en el trabajo de Gray y Larson (2002) y pretende reducir la brecha entre el enfoque teórico y la experiencia práctica.

El proyecto involucra a estudiantes de Arquitectura y Planificación Urbana e Ingeniería Industrial y de Sistemas, quienes trabajan en un proyecto común utilizando herramientas de gestión de proyectos. Se destaca la importancia de la cooperación entre disciplinas para abordar los desafíos complejos en la gestión de proyectos de construcción.

El texto también menciona la creación de una colaboración académica innovadora para establecer una infraestructura tecnológica que respalde los objetivos del programa, vinculando el proyecto al Centro de Estudios de Seguridad Vial de Qatar. Esto sugiere que los hallazgos del programa podrían tener aplicaciones directas en la mejora de la seguridad vial en el país.

El proyecto se centra en la seguridad vial en Qatar, donde los estudiantes aplican herramientas de gestión de proyectos para aumentar la conciencia sobre este tema. Se alinean con la Estrategia Nacional de Seguridad Vial de Qatar 2013-2022, que busca reducir el sufrimiento humano causado por accidentes de tráfico.

Los estudiantes investigan temas relacionados con la gestión de la seguridad vial, centrándose en cuatro áreas clave: carreteras seguras, vehículos seguros, velocidades seguras y usuarios de la carretera seguros. Se enfatiza la necesidad de diseñar infraestructuras viales que minimicen el riesgo de accidentes, así como la importancia de contar con vehículos seguros y establecer límites de velocidad adecuados.

El texto también aborda la recopilación de datos sobre accidentes en Qatar y la necesidad de protocolos formales para compartir esta información con la comunidad interesada. Se propone investigar el diseño de carreteras y realizar un rediseño de áreas peligrosas en Doha, considerando códigos y regulaciones internacionales y locales.

Los estudiantes inician su proyecto mediante actividades colaborativas para evaluar la conciencia sobre la seguridad vial en Qatar, utilizando diversas herramientas educativas. Se planifican y coordinan las fases del proyecto, y se utilizan métodos de investigación y plantillas para facilitar la gestión y presentación de resultados.

El proyecto aborda consideraciones financieras, como la viabilidad y estimación de costos, permitiendo a los estudiantes adquirir habilidades prácticas en la gestión de costos. Al finalizar, se espera que los estudiantes presenten recomendaciones, evidenciando su comprensión de la relación entre las personas y el entorno construido.

En la discusión y resultados, se menciona que vincular la investigación multidisciplinaria con los resultados de los proyectos fue problemático debido a cambios en los procesos de evaluación. Se establecen criterios de éxito relacionados con la gestión del proyecto y los resultados de la investigación.

El texto concluye que la colaboración multidisciplinaria y la aplicación práctica de la teoría son esenciales en la educación sobre gestión de proyectos, especialmente en el contexto de la seguridad vial en Qatar. Se identifican desafíos y se sugieren áreas para futuras investigaciones, enfatizando la necesidad de una evaluación continua y el desarrollo de habilidades prácticas en los estudiantes.

Finalmente, se presentan referencias que abordan temas relacionados con la gestión de proyectos, la cultura nacional, la educación en emprendimiento y la influencia de la cultura en las negociaciones internacionales, subrayando la importancia de aplicar la teoría en contextos prácticos para mejorar la efectividad de los proyectos.
