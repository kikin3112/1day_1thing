612  Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 1. Introduction  During the last era in business strategy area, many theoretical and empiric studies were made about  entrepreneurship. Although entrepreneurship mostly has been taken as an individual concept, today our  point of view about this subject has changed permanently. Entrepreneurship is not only the characteristics of different, brave, talented, genius individuals but also an institutional concept.   We can talk about the corporate entrepreneurship issue as an external or internal factor of organization  in three situations; (i) when an organization enters a new business; (ii) when an individual or a team in  organization design a new product; and (iii) when an entrepreneurial paradigm change permeates an entire organization’s outlook and operations [1].  Entrepreneurship also involves seeking and discovering new opportunities like new products and  processes, designing new organizational structures and winning new markets. This means periodic  revisions to structure and strategy; innovation, business creation and strategic renewal [2].  Terms such as intrapreneuring [3], corporate entrepreneurship [4], corporate venturing [5] and internal  corporate entrepreneurship [6] have been used to describe the phenomenon of intrapreneurship, but the  consensus on the concept of entrepreneurship involves creating value and developing opportunity through  innovation via the human and capital resources [7]. Jennings and Lumpkin [8] focuses on the new products and new markets in his corporate entrepreneurship definition. Miller, Schollhammer, Shane andVenkataraman and Zahra [9] have also emphasized new product innovation as an important activity in corporate entrepreneurship [10].  Just as Antoncic and Hisrich [11]; in this study, corporate entrepreneurship refers to a process that  goes on inside an existing firm like new business venturing, innovative activities and development of new
inside an existing firm like new business venturing, innovative activities and development of new products, services, technologies, administrative techniques, strategies, and competitive postures.  2. Theoretical background  The corporate entrepreneurship researches usually focus on two things: The factors of the firm’s  external environment [12] and organizational-level internal factors [13]. This study focuses on the  strategy process as a predictor which is also an internal factor.   Understanding entrepreneurial processes is vital for strategic management literature. Innovation and  new product strategies are generally associated with an entrepreneurial approach to competitive advantage whereas strategies based on  cost control and incremental pr ocess improvements tend to be in  the domain of established firms seeking to sustain advantage by erecting scale economy barriers [14].  Previous views of entrepreneurship can be classiﬁed into four dimensions: (i) new business venturing,  (ii) innovativeness, (iii) self-renewal, and (iv) proactiveness. New business venturing is the most salient characteristic of entrepreneurship because it can result in a new business creation within an existingorganization by redeﬁning the company’s products (or services) and/or by developing new markets. In  large corporations it can also include formation of more formally autonomous or semi-autonomous units or ﬁrms, internal venturing, corporate start-ups, autonomous business unit creation and new streams. For all organizations regardless of size, the new business-venturing  dimension refers to the creation of new
Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 613 businesses within the existing organization regardless of the level of autonomy. In contrast, the  innovativeness dimension refers to product and service innovation with emphasis on development and  innovation in technology. Entrepreneurship includes  new product development, product improvements,  and new production methods and procedures. Covin and Slevin [15] considered one part of the entrepreneurial posture that reflected itself in the extensiveness and frequency of product innovation and the related tendency of technolog ical leadership. Knight [16] included the development or enhancement  of products, services, and techni ques and technologies in production as part of organizational  innovativeness. Zahra [17] included product innovation and technological entrepreneurship as innovative  aspects of manufacturing firms. The self-renewal  dimension reflects the transformation of organizations  through the renewal of key ideas on which they are built. It has strategic and organizational change  connotations and includes the redefinition of the business concept, reorganization, and the introduction of system-wide changes for innovation. The final dimension— proactiveness —is related to aggressive  posturing relative to competitors. A proactive firm is inclined to take risks by conducting experiments. It  takes initiative [18] and is bold and aggressive in pursuing opportunities [19]. The concept of  proactiveness “refers to the extent to which organizations attempt to lead rather than follow competitors in such key business areas as the introduction of new products or services, operating technologies, and administrative techniques” [20]. Proactiveness includes initiative and risk taking and the competitiveaggressiveness and boldness that are reflected in orientations and activities of top management [21].  Corporate entrepreneurship has been attached to multiple organizational phenomena.
[21].  Corporate entrepreneurship has been attached to multiple organizational phenomena. Three of the most  common phenomena that are often viewed as examples of corporate entrepreneurship include situations where (i) an established organization enters a new business; (ii) an individual or individuals champion new product ideas within a corporate context; and (iii) an “entrepreneurial” philosophy permeates an entire organization’s outlook and operations [22]. This study assumes that, corporate entrepreneurship is related with the habits of the company about decision making processes. Corporate entrepreneurship haslong been recognized as a tool for improving competitive positioning and transforming corporations, their markets and industries as opportunities for value creating. However, only in recent years has much empirical evidence been provided which justifies the conventional wisdom that corporate entrepreneurship leads to superior firm performance [23].    The process of exploiting new opportunities in corporations is fraught with the same risks as those  facing start ups and smaller enterprises. This is partly because the outcomes of innovation, which is a core entrepreneurial activity, are difficult to predict. Indeed, a longstanding literature has highlighted significant challenges and shortcomings in the corporate entrepreneurship activities of firms. These challenges must be favored by organizational success [24].    In general, corporate entrepreneurship has been regarded an important element of successful  organizations. The relationship between corporate en trepreneurship and growth has received wide support  in past research [25]. On the other hand, corporate en trepreneurship was fo und to be related to  profitability [26] especially at large firms in USA and small, medium-sized and large firms in Europen Union member countries [27].  3. Hypotheses development  Corporate entrepreneurship is a strategic orientation involving the regeneration of
development  Corporate entrepreneurship is a strategic orientation involving the regeneration of products, processes,  services, strategies or even whole organizations [28]. As such, corporate entrepreneurship supports  sustained competitive advantage through the continuous generation and exploitation of new sources of knowledge. Therefore, corporate entrepreneurship can have significant impact upon organizational financial and market performance [29].
614  Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 Hypothesis 1: There is a significant effect of corporate entrepreneurship on abstract and concrete  performance.  The research of Hart and Banbury [30] showed that the role played by top manager can range all the  way being a commander to that of being a sponsor. They developed a typology of leadership styles  identifying five different modes of leadership during strategic formation process:   1.The Command Style: The strategy is driven by a leader or small top team.  2.Symbolic Style: Strategy is driven by mission and vision of the organization. 3.Rational Style: Strategy is driven by formal structure and planning systems. 4.Transactive Style: Strategy is driven by internal processes of mutual adjustment.  5.Generative Style: Strategy is driven by organizational actors’ initiative.  Command Symbolic Rational Transactive Generative         Performance Lower Performance  (Role Imbalance) Higher Performance (Greater Balance Between Relative  Contributions of Top Managers and Organizational Members) Lower  Performance  (Role Imbalance)  Fig. 1: Strategy Making Mode and Firm Performance (Hart, 1992, p.340.)

Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 615 In the command style , a strong individual leader or a few top managers exercise total control over the  firm. Strategy making is a conscious, controlled process that is centralized at the very top of the  organization. In such a mode, strategies are deliberate, fully formed and ready to be implemented. Thesymbolic mode  involves the creation by top management of a compelling vision and clear corporate  mission. The corporate vision defines the basic philosophy and values of the firm. Unlike the command or symbolic modes, the rational mode  seeks to be comprehensive in scope. There is a high level of  information processing. Formal analysis, such as environmental scanning, portfolio analysis and industry and competitive analysis is often used to aid in competitive strategy. The transactive mode  is based on  interaction and learning rather than the execution of a predetermined plan. Strategy is crafted based upon  an ongoing dialog with key stakeholders- employees, suppliers, customers, governments and regulations.The generative mode  of strategy-making is dependent upon the autonomous behavior of organization  members. Strategy is made via intrapreneurship-new product ideas emerge upward and employee  initiative shapes the firm’s strategic direction [31].   It’s expected that while command style effects abstract and concrete performance negatively and low,  the symbolic, rational and transactive mode will effect abstract and concrete performance positively and stronger than command and generative style as Hart refers.   Hypothesis 2: There are significant and different effects of strategy formation processes on abstract  and concrete performance.   Management of corporate entrepreneurship is distinct from traditional management because of the  conditions of greater uncertainty. The first challeng e is managing the knowledge. The second challenge for the management of corporate
first challeng e is managing the knowledge. The second challenge for the management of corporate entrepreneurship as a result of dynamism, complexity and uncertainty, is  that corporate entrepreneurship requires coordination through mutual adjustment rather than command and control, and is driven by commitment rather than consensus [32].  It’s strongly expected that corporate entrepreneurship is related with the habits of the company about decision making processes. The decentralization of this process can build an organic structure which the workers can take the initiative and this change will spread the entrepreneurship process from business owners or leaders to the whole company. While command style will effect corporate entrepreneurship negatively, the other styles are expected to effect corporate entrepreneurship positively.  Hypothesis 3: There is a strong relationship between strategy process and corporate entrepreneurship.  4. Methodology  4.1. Data collection and instrument  The type of the research is hypothetic research. Data collection method is survey. Sample selection  method is coincidental. The universe of this work consists of the enterprises in the list of Istanbul  Chamber of Industry that means approximately 12000 members. Face-to-face survey, mail and telephone  survey is used for reaching maximum participation.
616  Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 4.2. Measures  The survey prepared for the research has 71 questions. As seen at Table 1, measure of corporate  entrepreneurship [33] has 35 items, measure of Strategic Leader Types [34] has 16 items. There are also  10 questions about the firm’s perceived performance, 1 question about firm size, 1 question about the sector of the firm, and 8 questions about the demographics. Likert Scale-5 is used in all questions.   Table 1: Measures Used in Research  Measure   Developers Item Number  Corporate Entrepreneurship Antoncic and Hisrich (2003) 35  Strategic Leader Types Hart and Banbury (1994) 16  Organizational Performance - 10  Factor analysis is used to determine the dimensions of the measures. Also K-S test for normal  distribution and Cronbach Alpha test for reliability, Correlation and Regression tests are made with SPSS 17.0 to measure the power of hypothesis.   Before testing the main hypothesis, the descriptive statistics and the correlation test between the  factors in the model is analyzed. Then, a multi regression test is made for measuring the effect of the independent variables (corporate entrepreneurship, strategic leader types) on firm performance.   4.3. Factor Analysis and Reliabilities  Expletory factor analysis is made for establishing the sub dimensions of measures. All factors have  passed the KMO Measure of Sampling Adequacy and Bartlett test of Sphericity which means that our  data set is appropriate for factor analyses (Table 2). Pri ncipal components and varimax method are used  in analysis. For all measures, items which have factor weight below 0,50; unique items in a factor; items with close factor weights are leaved out of evaluation. After this processes, factors which have initial eigenvalues over 1,00 and Cronbach Alpha over 0,65 are:  4 factors in Corporate Entrepreneurship Measure (Cumulative Extraction Sums= %75,905) which can  be called as Innovativeness
Measure (Cumulative Extraction Sums= %75,905) which can  be called as Innovativeness (Cronbach Alpha=0, ,935)., Proactiveness (Cronbach Alpha=0,831)., Self Renewal (Cronbach Alpha=0,817)., New Business Venturing (Cronbach Alpha=0,852).   4 factors in Strategic Leaders Types Measure (Cumulative Extraction Sums= %82,056) which can be  called as Rational – Transactive (Cronbach Alpha=0, 936), Commander (Cronbach Alpha=0, 830), Symbolic (Cronbach Alpha=0, 829) and Generative (Cronbach Alpha=0, 763).   2 factors in Organizational Performance Measure (Cumulative Extraction Sums= %74,301 which can  be called as Concrete Performance (Cronbach Alpha=0,919) and Abstract Performance (Cronbach Alpha=0,753).  Concrete performance consists of sales, financial performance, profitability, market share  and reaching goals items which can be called as concrete performance criteria; and the second factor of
Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 617 performance consists of handling difficulties, HR quality and meeting expectations items which can be  called as abstract performance criteria (Table 2).

Descriptive Statistics and Correlations  80,9% of the participants are upper level manager. Rest of them are middle and lower level manager.  80,1% of the respondents are man, and 19,9 % of them are woman. Their average age is 41,18. 46,1% of  the respondents are bachelor; 22,7% of them have master, %2,8 have PhD degree. 57,4% of the respondents have more than 5000 TL (>3300 $) of monthly income, 16,3 % of them have 4000-5000 TL and 19,9 % of them have 3000-4000 TL monthly income. 34% of the respondents have an experience  more than 15 years and 20,6% of them have an experience of 5-10 years.       When we look at the descriptive statistics of the factors at Table 3, we can see that the commander  style in leadership is very common (M=3,93) and symbolic leadership follows it (M=3,52). In these firms, rational-transactive leadership is rarely followed (M=2,88). Corporate Entrepreneurship level of the companies in Istanbul is perceived very optimistic. For example innovativeness of these firms are perceived very high (M=3,34) and the other factors of corporate entrepreneurship which are proactiveness(M=3,07), self renewal(M=3,01), new business venturing (M=3,11) are not so low. We can also say that the optimism of the participants persists in going on about the firm
so low. We can also say that the optimism of the participants persists in going on about the firm performance (M=3,61and M=3,54).

We see that when age,  professional seniority and firm seniority gets high, managers tend to lose their optimism about self  renewal and new business venturing of the company. Also they perceive the concrete and abstract performance worse and think that leadership is less generative.  Education effects the perception of proactiveness negatively, and commander style positively. Income only effects the perception of new business venturing negatively.   Correlation test between the factors are shown at Table 4. We see high positive correlations between  the all factors of corporate entrepreneurship and “ratio nal-transactive leadership” (r=-0,638; 0,537; 0,401;  0,438); “symbolic leadership” (r=0,613; 0,397; 0,354; 0,364) and “generative leadership” (r=0,581; 0,514; 0,521;0,278). Just as expected, commander leadership affects all corporate entrepreneurship dimensions negatively, but only 3 of them are significant. (r=-0,363; -0,326, -0,260). There is no
dimensions negatively, but only 3 of them are significant. (r=-0,363; -0,326, -0,260). There is no significant relationship between commander style and proactiveness.  These relations confirm our  hypothesis 3, but the last decisions will be made after the multi regression test. When we look at the correlations between the dimensions of corporate entrepreneurship and performance, we see that concrete performance has the highest correlation with new business venturing. Self renewal and innovativeness follows it. Just like the concrete performance, abstract performance has the highest correlation with new business venturing. Innovativeness, self renewal and proactiveness follow it.   The relations between leadership and performance show that the most effective leadership in our field  is rational-transactive style. Symbolic and generative styles have similar positive effects. These effects are greater in abstract performance than concrete performance. Command style both effects concrete and abstract performance negatively and it must get out of use.   All the correlations support our hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2. After the multi regression tests, we can  see the table clearly.

624  Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 Table 9 presents the results of multivariate regression models. Model 1 indicates that the significant effects are “Rational – Transactive Style” ( ȕ=0,589) and “Symbolic Style” on Abstact Performance (ȕ=0,208) as mentioned at Table 6. In Model 2, we see that while the effect of “Rational – Transactive  Style” is still significant, “Symbolic Style” loose its power. The significant effects are the effect of  “Rational – Transactive Style”, “New Business Venturing” and “Self Renewal” on Abstract Performance. This means that, if “Symbolic Style” has significant effect on “New Business Venturing” as mentioned at  Table 7, then “New Business Venturing” is a mediator  between “Symbolic Style” and Abstract  Performance as shown in Figure 2.  5. Conclusion  The only effective dimension of corporate entrepreneurship on concrete performance is “New Business  Venturing”.  This dimension has a positive effect not only on the concrete performance but also on  abstract performance. It’s also a mediator between strategic leadership styles (rational – transactive and  commander) and performance. We clearly see that the creation of new businesses within the existing organization is the most useful movement in Istanbul market in short and long term success.   “Innovativeness” and “Self Renewal” have positive effect on “Abstract Performance”. It means that  new product development, product improvements, new production methods, procedures and transformation of organizations through the renewal of key ideas affects the performance in long term which are handling difficulties, HR quality and meeting expectations.   There is no significant effect of proactiveness on performance. It shows us that aggressive posturing  relative to competitors is not an effective way of  corporate entrepreneurship in Istanbul market.  When we look at the strategy process types, we see that while “Rational – Transactive Style”
When we look at the strategy process types, we see that while “Rational – Transactive Style” effects  “Concrete Performance” positively, “Commander Style” has negative effect on it. Also “Rational-Transactive Style” and “Symbolic Style” effects “Abstract Performance” positively. There is no significant effect of generative style on performance.   The positive effect of rational-transactive style and the negative effect of command style on concrete performance disappear without new business venturing. Also the positive effect of symbolic style on abstract performance disappear without new business venturing too.  Just as Hart [35] predicted weak performance at the two extreme sides of his scale which are  Command and Generative style, we see a negative effect of Command Style on Concrete Performance, neutral effect of Command Style on Abstract Performance and neutral effect of generative style on both Concrete and Abstract Performance. It means that a strong individual leader or highly autonomous  behavior of organization members doesn’t work in this market.  The only powerful positive effect on concrete performance comes from the Rational-Transactive Style  which has a high level of information processing, formal analysis, such as environmental scanning, portfolio analysis and industry and competitive analysis, and which is not closed to ongoing dialog with key stakeholders (employees, suppliers, customers, governments and regulations).   The significant positive effect of Symbolic Style on Abstract Performance means that when strategy is  driven by mission and vision of the organization with strong corporate culture, long term positive advantages such as handling difficulties, HR quality and meeting expectations are gained.
Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 625 When we look at the results of the multi regression tests for the effect of strategy process on corporate  entrepreneurship we clearly see that if you want innovativeness from the company, you have to be a  symbolic leader. Because product and service innovation with emphasis on development and innovation in technology needs a strong and relevant corporate culture, mission and vision that is carried by thewhole company. Rational-Transactive and Generative leader also has positive effects on innovativeness while Commander has an opposite effect.   If you want proactiveness from the company, you have to be generative. It means that the autonomous  behavior of organizational members causes aggressive activities in the market. As we see the neutral effect of proactiveness on performance generative style doesn’t look useful.   If you need self renewal from the company you have to be generative too, or at least symbolic. For  new business venturing which gathers concrete performance, you have to be Rational-Transactive or  Symbolic which also have positive effects on performance.   The leading practical suggestion of this study is using the Rational-Transactive style which positively  affects Innovativeness, Proactiveness, New Business Venturing, Concrete Performance and Abstract  Performance. With it’s high level of information processing, formal analysis, such as environmental  scanning, portfolio analysis and industry and competitive analysis, Rational-Transactive style looks like  the best way of strategy deployment process. Furthe r researches should investigate the relationship  between the corporate entrepreneurship and human resources management practices (job design, team  based structure, performance evaluation systems, training)  or organizational culture.

612  Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 1. Introduction  During the last era in business strategy area, many theoretical and empiric studies were made about  entrepreneurship. Although entrepreneurship mostly has been taken as an individual concept, today our  point of view about this subject has changed permanently. Entrepreneurship is not only the characteristics of different, brave, talented, genius individuals but also an institutional concept.   We can talk about the corporate entrepreneurship issue as an external or internal factor of organization  in three situations; (i) when an organization enters a new business; (ii) when an individual or a team in  organization design a new product; and (iii) when an entrepreneurial paradigm change permeates an entire organization’s outlook and operations [1].  Entrepreneurship also involves seeking and discovering new opportunities like new products and  processes, designing new organizational structures and winning new markets. This means periodic  revisions to structure and strategy; innovation, business creation and strategic renewal [2].  Terms such as intrapreneuring [3], corporate entrepreneurship [4], corporate venturing [5] and internal  corporate entrepreneurship [6] have been used to describe the phenomenon of intrapreneurship, but the  consensus on the concept of entrepreneurship involves creating value and developing opportunity through  innovation via the human and capital resources [7]. Jennings and Lumpkin [8] focuses on the new products and new markets in his corporate entrepreneurship definition. Miller, Schollhammer, Shane andVenkataraman and Zahra [9] have also emphasized new product innovation as an important activity in corporate entrepreneurship [10].  Just as Antoncic and Hisrich [11]; in this study, corporate entrepreneurship refers to a process that  goes on inside an existing firm like new business venturing, innovative activities and development of new
inside an existing firm like new business venturing, innovative activities and development of new products, services, technologies, administrative techniques, strategies, and competitive postures.  2. Theoretical background  The corporate entrepreneurship researches usually focus on two things: The factors of the firm’s  external environment [12] and organizational-level internal factors [13]. This study focuses on the  strategy process as a predictor which is also an internal factor.   Understanding entrepreneurial processes is vital for strategic management literature. Innovation and  new product strategies are generally associated with an entrepreneurial approach to competitive advantage whereas strategies based on  cost control and incremental pr ocess improvements tend to be in  the domain of established firms seeking to sustain advantage by erecting scale economy barriers [14].  Previous views of entrepreneurship can be classiﬁed into four dimensions: (i) new business venturing,  (ii) innovativeness, (iii) self-renewal, and (iv) proactiveness. New business venturing is the most salient characteristic of entrepreneurship because it can result in a new business creation within an existingorganization by redeﬁning the company’s products (or services) and/or by developing new markets. In  large corporations it can also include formation of more formally autonomous or semi-autonomous units or ﬁrms, internal venturing, corporate start-ups, autonomous business unit creation and new streams. For all organizations regardless of size, the new business-venturing  dimension refers to the creation of new --- development  Corporate entrepreneurship is a strategic orientation involving the regeneration of products, processes,  services, strategies or even whole organizations [28]. As such, corporate entrepreneurship supports  sustained competitive advantage through the continuous generation and exploitation of new sources of knowledge. Therefore, corporate entrepreneurship can have significant impact upon organizational financial and market performance [29].
Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 613 businesses within the existing organization regardless of the level of autonomy. In contrast, the  innovativeness dimension refers to product and service innovation with emphasis on development and  innovation in technology. Entrepreneurship includes  new product development, product improvements,  and new production methods and procedures. Covin and Slevin [15] considered one part of the entrepreneurial posture that reflected itself in the extensiveness and frequency of product innovation and the related tendency of technolog ical leadership. Knight [16] included the development or enhancement  of products, services, and techni ques and technologies in production as part of organizational  innovativeness. Zahra [17] included product innovation and technological entrepreneurship as innovative  aspects of manufacturing firms. The self-renewal  dimension reflects the transformation of organizations  through the renewal of key ideas on which they are built. It has strategic and organizational change  connotations and includes the redefinition of the business concept, reorganization, and the introduction of system-wide changes for innovation. The final dimension— proactiveness —is related to aggressive  posturing relative to competitors. A proactive firm is inclined to take risks by conducting experiments. It  takes initiative [18] and is bold and aggressive in pursuing opportunities [19]. The concept of  proactiveness “refers to the extent to which organizations attempt to lead rather than follow competitors in such key business areas as the introduction of new products or services, operating technologies, and administrative techniques” [20]. Proactiveness includes initiative and risk taking and the competitiveaggressiveness and boldness that are reflected in orientations and activities of top management [21].  Corporate entrepreneurship has been attached to multiple organizational phenomena.
[21].  Corporate entrepreneurship has been attached to multiple organizational phenomena. Three of the most  common phenomena that are often viewed as examples of corporate entrepreneurship include situations where (i) an established organization enters a new business; (ii) an individual or individuals champion new product ideas within a corporate context; and (iii) an “entrepreneurial” philosophy permeates an entire organization’s outlook and operations [22]. This study assumes that, corporate entrepreneurship is related with the habits of the company about decision making processes. Corporate entrepreneurship haslong been recognized as a tool for improving competitive positioning and transforming corporations, their markets and industries as opportunities for value creating. However, only in recent years has much empirical evidence been provided which justifies the conventional wisdom that corporate entrepreneurship leads to superior firm performance [23].    The process of exploiting new opportunities in corporations is fraught with the same risks as those  facing start ups and smaller enterprises. This is partly because the outcomes of innovation, which is a core entrepreneurial activity, are difficult to predict. Indeed, a longstanding literature has highlighted significant challenges and shortcomings in the corporate entrepreneurship activities of firms. These challenges must be favored by organizational success [24].    In general, corporate entrepreneurship has been regarded an important element of successful  organizations. The relationship between corporate en trepreneurship and growth has received wide support  in past research [25]. On the other hand, corporate en trepreneurship was fo und to be related to  profitability [26] especially at large firms in USA and small, medium-sized and large firms in Europen Union member countries [27].  3. Hypotheses development  Corporate entrepreneurship is a strategic orientation involving the regeneration of
614  Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 Hypothesis 1: There is a significant effect of corporate entrepreneurship on abstract and concrete  performance.  The research of Hart and Banbury [30] showed that the role played by top manager can range all the  way being a commander to that of being a sponsor. They developed a typology of leadership styles  identifying five different modes of leadership during strategic formation process:   1.The Command Style: The strategy is driven by a leader or small top team.  2.Symbolic Style: Strategy is driven by mission and vision of the organization. 3.Rational Style: Strategy is driven by formal structure and planning systems. 4.Transactive Style: Strategy is driven by internal processes of mutual adjustment.  5.Generative Style: Strategy is driven by organizational actors’ initiative.  Command Symbolic Rational Transactive Generative         Performance Lower Performance  (Role Imbalance) Higher Performance (Greater Balance Between Relative  Contributions of Top Managers and Organizational Members) Lower  Performance  (Role Imbalance)  Fig. 1: Strategy Making Mode and Firm Performance (Hart, 1992, p.340.)

Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 615 In the command style , a strong individual leader or a few top managers exercise total control over the  firm. Strategy making is a conscious, controlled process that is centralized at the very top of the  organization. In such a mode, strategies are deliberate, fully formed and ready to be implemented. Thesymbolic mode  involves the creation by top management of a compelling vision and clear corporate  mission. The corporate vision defines the basic philosophy and values of the firm. Unlike the command or symbolic modes, the rational mode  seeks to be comprehensive in scope. There is a high level of  information processing. Formal analysis, such as environmental scanning, portfolio analysis and industry and competitive analysis is often used to aid in competitive strategy. The transactive mode  is based on  interaction and learning rather than the execution of a predetermined plan. Strategy is crafted based upon  an ongoing dialog with key stakeholders- employees, suppliers, customers, governments and regulations.The generative mode  of strategy-making is dependent upon the autonomous behavior of organization  members. Strategy is made via intrapreneurship-new product ideas emerge upward and employee  initiative shapes the firm’s strategic direction [31].   It’s expected that while command style effects abstract and concrete performance negatively and low,  the symbolic, rational and transactive mode will effect abstract and concrete performance positively and stronger than command and generative style as Hart refers.   Hypothesis 2: There are significant and different effects of strategy formation processes on abstract  and concrete performance.   Management of corporate entrepreneurship is distinct from traditional management because of the  conditions of greater uncertainty. The first challeng e is managing the knowledge. The second challenge for the management of corporate
first challeng e is managing the knowledge. The second challenge for the management of corporate entrepreneurship as a result of dynamism, complexity and uncertainty, is  that corporate entrepreneurship requires coordination through mutual adjustment rather than command and control, and is driven by commitment rather than consensus [32].  It’s strongly expected that corporate entrepreneurship is related with the habits of the company about decision making processes. The decentralization of this process can build an organic structure which the workers can take the initiative and this change will spread the entrepreneurship process from business owners or leaders to the whole company. While command style will effect corporate entrepreneurship negatively, the other styles are expected to effect corporate entrepreneurship positively.  Hypothesis 3: There is a strong relationship between strategy process and corporate entrepreneurship.  4. Methodology  4.1. Data collection and instrument  The type of the research is hypothetic research. Data collection method is survey. Sample selection  method is coincidental. The universe of this work consists of the enterprises in the list of Istanbul  Chamber of Industry that means approximately 12000 members. Face-to-face survey, mail and telephone  survey is used for reaching maximum participation.
616  Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 4.2. Measures  The survey prepared for the research has 71 questions. As seen at Table 1, measure of corporate  entrepreneurship [33] has 35 items, measure of Strategic Leader Types [34] has 16 items. There are also  10 questions about the firm’s perceived performance, 1 question about firm size, 1 question about the sector of the firm, and 8 questions about the demographics. Likert Scale-5 is used in all questions.   Table 1: Measures Used in Research  Measure   Developers Item Number  Corporate Entrepreneurship Antoncic and Hisrich (2003) 35  Strategic Leader Types Hart and Banbury (1994) 16  Organizational Performance - 10  Factor analysis is used to determine the dimensions of the measures. Also K-S test for normal  distribution and Cronbach Alpha test for reliability, Correlation and Regression tests are made with SPSS 17.0 to measure the power of hypothesis.   Before testing the main hypothesis, the descriptive statistics and the correlation test between the  factors in the model is analyzed. Then, a multi regression test is made for measuring the effect of the independent variables (corporate entrepreneurship, strategic leader types) on firm performance.   4.3. Factor Analysis and Reliabilities  Expletory factor analysis is made for establishing the sub dimensions of measures. All factors have  passed the KMO Measure of Sampling Adequacy and Bartlett test of Sphericity which means that our  data set is appropriate for factor analyses (Table 2). Pri ncipal components and varimax method are used  in analysis. For all measures, items which have factor weight below 0,50; unique items in a factor; items with close factor weights are leaved out of evaluation. After this processes, factors which have initial eigenvalues over 1,00 and Cronbach Alpha over 0,65 are:  4 factors in Corporate Entrepreneurship Measure (Cumulative Extraction Sums= %75,905) which can  be called as Innovativeness --- Measure (Cumulative Extraction Sums= %75,905) which can  be called as Innovativeness (Cronbach Alpha=0, ,935)., Proactiveness (Cronbach Alpha=0,831)., Self Renewal (Cronbach Alpha=0,817)., New Business Venturing (Cronbach Alpha=0,852).   4 factors in Strategic Leaders Types Measure (Cumulative Extraction Sums= %82,056) which can be  called as Rational – Transactive (Cronbach Alpha=0, 936), Commander (Cronbach Alpha=0, 830), Symbolic (Cronbach Alpha=0, 829) and Generative (Cronbach Alpha=0, 763).   2 factors in Organizational Performance Measure (Cumulative Extraction Sums= %74,301 which can  be called as Concrete Performance (Cronbach Alpha=0,919) and Abstract Performance (Cronbach Alpha=0,753).  Concrete performance consists of sales, financial performance, profitability, market share  and reaching goals items which can be called as concrete performance criteria; and the second factor of --- Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 617 performance consists of handling difficulties, HR quality and meeting expectations items which can be  called as abstract performance criteria (Table 2).

Descriptive Statistics and Correlations  80,9% of the participants are upper level manager. Rest of them are middle and lower level manager.  80,1% of the respondents are man, and 19,9 % of them are woman. Their average age is 41,18. 46,1% of  the respondents are bachelor; 22,7% of them have master, %2,8 have PhD degree. 57,4% of the respondents have more than 5000 TL (>3300 $) of monthly income, 16,3 % of them have 4000-5000 TL and 19,9 % of them have 3000-4000 TL monthly income. 34% of the respondents have an experience  more than 15 years and 20,6% of them have an experience of 5-10 years.       When we look at the descriptive statistics of the factors at Table 3, we can see that the commander  style in leadership is very common (M=3,93) and symbolic leadership follows it (M=3,52). In these firms, rational-transactive leadership is rarely followed (M=2,88). Corporate Entrepreneurship level of the companies in Istanbul is perceived very optimistic. For example innovativeness of these firms are perceived very high (M=3,34) and the other factors of corporate entrepreneurship which are proactiveness(M=3,07), self renewal(M=3,01), new business venturing (M=3,11) are not so low. We can also say that the optimism of the participants persists in going on about the firm
so low. We can also say that the optimism of the participants persists in going on about the firm performance (M=3,61and M=3,54).

We see that when age,  professional seniority and firm seniority gets high, managers tend to lose their optimism about self  renewal and new business venturing of the company. Also they perceive the concrete and abstract performance worse and think that leadership is less generative.  Education effects the perception of proactiveness negatively, and commander style positively. Income only effects the perception of new business venturing negatively.   Correlation test between the factors are shown at Table 4. We see high positive correlations between  the all factors of corporate entrepreneurship and “ratio nal-transactive leadership” (r=-0,638; 0,537; 0,401;  0,438); “symbolic leadership” (r=0,613; 0,397; 0,354; 0,364) and “generative leadership” (r=0,581; 0,514; 0,521;0,278). Just as expected, commander leadership affects all corporate entrepreneurship dimensions negatively, but only 3 of them are significant. (r=-0,363; -0,326, -0,260). There is no
dimensions negatively, but only 3 of them are significant. (r=-0,363; -0,326, -0,260). There is no significant relationship between commander style and proactiveness.  These relations confirm our  hypothesis 3, but the last decisions will be made after the multi regression test. When we look at the correlations between the dimensions of corporate entrepreneurship and performance, we see that concrete performance has the highest correlation with new business venturing. Self renewal and innovativeness follows it. Just like the concrete performance, abstract performance has the highest correlation with new business venturing. Innovativeness, self renewal and proactiveness follow it.   The relations between leadership and performance show that the most effective leadership in our field  is rational-transactive style. Symbolic and generative styles have similar positive effects. These effects are greater in abstract performance than concrete performance. Command style both effects concrete and abstract performance negatively and it must get out of use.   All the correlations support our hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2. After the multi regression tests, we can  see the table clearly.

624  Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 Table 9 presents the results of multivariate regression models. Model 1 indicates that the significant effects are “Rational – Transactive Style” ( ȕ=0,589) and “Symbolic Style” on Abstact Performance (ȕ=0,208) as mentioned at Table 6. In Model 2, we see that while the effect of “Rational – Transactive  Style” is still significant, “Symbolic Style” loose its power. The significant effects are the effect of  “Rational – Transactive Style”, “New Business Venturing” and “Self Renewal” on Abstract Performance. This means that, if “Symbolic Style” has significant effect on “New Business Venturing” as mentioned at  Table 7, then “New Business Venturing” is a mediator  between “Symbolic Style” and Abstract  Performance as shown in Figure 2.  5. Conclusion  The only effective dimension of corporate entrepreneurship on concrete performance is “New Business  Venturing”.  This dimension has a positive effect not only on the concrete performance but also on  abstract performance. It’s also a mediator between strategic leadership styles (rational – transactive and  commander) and performance. We clearly see that the creation of new businesses within the existing organization is the most useful movement in Istanbul market in short and long term success.   “Innovativeness” and “Self Renewal” have positive effect on “Abstract Performance”. It means that  new product development, product improvements, new production methods, procedures and transformation of organizations through the renewal of key ideas affects the performance in long term which are handling difficulties, HR quality and meeting expectations.   There is no significant effect of proactiveness on performance. It shows us that aggressive posturing  relative to competitors is not an effective way of  corporate entrepreneurship in Istanbul market.  When we look at the strategy process types, we see that while “Rational – Transactive Style”
When we look at the strategy process types, we see that while “Rational – Transactive Style” effects  “Concrete Performance” positively, “Commander Style” has negative effect on it. Also “Rational-Transactive Style” and “Symbolic Style” effects “Abstract Performance” positively. There is no significant effect of generative style on performance.   The positive effect of rational-transactive style and the negative effect of command style on concrete performance disappear without new business venturing. Also the positive effect of symbolic style on abstract performance disappear without new business venturing too.  Just as Hart [35] predicted weak performance at the two extreme sides of his scale which are  Command and Generative style, we see a negative effect of Command Style on Concrete Performance, neutral effect of Command Style on Abstract Performance and neutral effect of generative style on both Concrete and Abstract Performance. It means that a strong individual leader or highly autonomous  behavior of organization members doesn’t work in this market.  The only powerful positive effect on concrete performance comes from the Rational-Transactive Style  which has a high level of information processing, formal analysis, such as environmental scanning, portfolio analysis and industry and competitive analysis, and which is not closed to ongoing dialog with key stakeholders (employees, suppliers, customers, governments and regulations).   The significant positive effect of Symbolic Style on Abstract Performance means that when strategy is  driven by mission and vision of the organization with strong corporate culture, long term positive advantages such as handling difficulties, HR quality and meeting expectations are gained.
Ata Özdemirci / Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences 24 (2011) 611–626 625 When we look at the results of the multi regression tests for the effect of strategy process on corporate  entrepreneurship we clearly see that if you want innovativeness from the company, you have to be a  symbolic leader. Because product and service innovation with emphasis on development and innovation in technology needs a strong and relevant corporate culture, mission and vision that is carried by thewhole company. Rational-Transactive and Generative leader also has positive effects on innovativeness while Commander has an opposite effect.   If you want proactiveness from the company, you have to be generative. It means that the autonomous  behavior of organizational members causes aggressive activities in the market. As we see the neutral effect of proactiveness on performance generative style doesn’t look useful.   If you need self renewal from the company you have to be generative too, or at least symbolic. For  new business venturing which gathers concrete performance, you have to be Rational-Transactive or  Symbolic which also have positive effects on performance.   The leading practical suggestion of this study is using the Rational-Transactive style which positively  affects Innovativeness, Proactiveness, New Business Venturing, Concrete Performance and Abstract  Performance. With it’s high level of information processing, formal analysis, such as environmental  scanning, portfolio analysis and industry and competitive analysis, Rational-Transactive style looks like  the best way of strategy deployment process. Furthe r researches should investigate the relationship  between the corporate entrepreneurship and human resources management practices (job design, team  based structure, performance evaluation systems, training)  or organizational culture.

En el estudio realizado por Ata Özdemirci en 2011, se examinó la relación entre el emprendimiento corporativo y el proceso estratégico en empresas de Estambul. Se encontró que el emprendimiento corporativo influye en el rendimiento concreto y abstracto de la empresa, con efectos significativos de diferentes estilos de liderazgo en la innovación, la proactividad y la creación de nuevos negocios.

Se observó que el estilo racional-transactivo tiene un impacto positivo en el rendimiento concreto y abstracto, mientras que el estilo comandante tiene un efecto negativo en el rendimiento concreto. El estilo simbólico tiene un efecto positivo en el rendimiento abstracto. Además, se encontró que la proactividad no tiene un efecto significativo en el rendimiento, y que la creación de nuevas empresas es crucial para el éxito a corto y largo plazo en el mercado de Estambul.

El estudio sugiere que el enfoque racional-transactivo es el más efectivo para lograr resultados emprendedores, y que la innovación, la renovación personal y la creación de nuevos negocios son factores clave para el éxito empresarial. Se destaca la importancia de la cultura corporativa, la misión y la visión en la promoción de la innovación y la creatividad dentro de la organización.

En resumen, el estudio de Ata Özdemirci resalta la importancia de los estilos de liderazgo en el emprendimiento corporativo y sugiere que un enfoque racional-transactivo puede ser el más efectivo para lograr diversos resultados emprendedores en el contexto empresarial.
