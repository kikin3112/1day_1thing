These mobileDNA labs offer upper-secondary students the opportunity to experience genomics research through experiments with laboratory equipment that is not available in schools and place genomics research in a relevant societal context. The design of the DNA lab ‘read the language of the tumor’ is evaluated, byclarifying the goals and choices in the design, and the effects of the DNA lab are presented. Based on the analysis of the design of the DNA lab and supported by the results of the evaluating studies, we con- sider this module to be a good example of relevant and up-to-date genomics education. Keywords : High school, genomics, outreach, laboratory exercises, tumor biology. Rapid advances in molecular biology increase the gap between research practice and school science. Implica-tions of genomics research are rapidly ﬁnding their wayto everyday practice. Major breakthroughs range frommedicine to forensics, biofuels, vaccine research, and mitigation of pollution [1]. These scientiﬁc advances each bring their own choices and dilemmas. To empowerfuture citizens to deal with these personal and societaldecisions science education based on relevant andup-to-date science is needed. Many advances in molecular life sciences are not yet represented in science curricula [2, 3]. However, simplyadding new content without rethinking the curriculum isnot
science curricula [2, 3]. However, simplyadding new content without rethinking the curriculum isnot a viable strategy. In several countries, new curriculaconcerning molecular life sciences have been proposedor introduced [2, 4–6]. Advances in genomics research have caused fundamental changes in the scientiﬁc view on the inner working of the living cell, while secondary-school students still have problems grasping the basicconcepts of DNA and proteins [7–9]. Since 2006, an extracurricular development in the Netherlands aims to bridge the gap between school sci-ence and molecular biology research practice. The DutchGenomics Centres of Excellence and the Centre for Soci-ety & Genomics, which are part of the Netherlands Genomics Initiative (NGI), developed the ‘DNA labs onthe road’. These mobile DNA labs offer students the op-portunity to experience genomics research throughexperiments with laboratory equipment that is not avail- able in schools. Five different ‘DNA labs on the road’ were developed in collaboration with Dutch universities.The 4-hour educational modules for secondary-schoolstudents (ages 16–18) include an introductory lesson, a2-hour practical taught at school by university studentsand a ﬁnal lesson. Teacher and student manuals havebeen developed for each lab and are made available inadvance of the introductory lesson. The labs are offeredfree of charge to all secondary schools in the Nether-lands since January 2006. Costs for equipment, transportand training the students are covered by the genomics research centers, which are funded in part by the Nether- lands Genomics Initiative (NGI: www.genomics.nl). Teach-ers can obtain additional information and register for thelabs on the DNA lab website (www.DNAlabs.eu). Thepractical work of the lab takes 2 hours. Taking travel timeinto account, the university students can teach the lab toa maximum of two different classes within the sameschool in 1 day. GOALS OF THE ‘DNA LABS ON THE ROAD’ The DNA labs are an

Dutch upper-secondary education. The speciﬁc experi- ments performed in the DNA labs differ, but in each casethe students perform hands-on laboratory activities, suchas DNA isolation, analyzing DNA using Polymerase ChainReaction (PCR) and bioinformatics tools, in their ownclassroom. The ‘DNA labs on the road’ thus offergenomics techniques in the classroom. More importantly,the DNA labs provide students a context, in which newinsights in genomics are used to solve everyday prob-lems. The DNA labs deal with different contexts: produc-ing biofuels, plant breeding, forensics, and use of bioin- formatics in crime scene investigations and improving the understanding and treatment of diseases such asAlzheimer’s and cancer. These topics all rely ongenomics research and they reﬂect the research activ-ities of the genomics centers in the Netherlands. TheDNA labs show that genomics research plays an impor-tant role in society and they encourage reﬂection on thepersonal and societal implications of genomics research.These different aspects are summarized in the goals ofthe DNA labs formulated at the start of the project. The DNA labs aim at: •Enhancing up-to-date genomics knowledge •Improving the image and attitude towards genomics topics •Increasing the notion of societal implications of genomics research (place genomics in a societalcontext) •Invoking enthusiasm and interest in genomics research These goals have been the starting point for designing the DNA labs. In each of the DNA labs, these generalgoals were further speciﬁed and translated into aninstructional design. Several studies were performed totest whether the formulated goals had been reached. In this article, we focus on just one of the DNA labs named ‘read the language of the tumor’. This module oncancer research was developed by the Cancer Genomics Centre (CGC) in collaboration with the Freudenthal Insti- tute for Science and Mathematics Education (FIsme) ofUtrecht University. The questions addressed in this
for Science and Mathematics Education (FIsme) ofUtrecht University. The questions addressed in this article are: 1). How are the general goals of the DNA labs trans- lated into an instructional design? 2). To what extent have the educational goals been reached by this design? MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed the instructional design, the classroom practice, the results in student and teacher appreciation and learning outcomes, and the contribution both to the goals of the NGIand the innovation of biology education. We made use of study of the scientiﬁc literature, analysis of the educational materials of the module and of the student-as- sistant training course, interviews with people involved in theproject, classroom observations, focus group interviews, ques-tionnaires, and analysis of results of the assignments in the module. Parallel to this study, an evaluation of ﬁve of the DNA labs was performed regarding their quality, their learning outcomesand their effect on the attitude of the students toward genomics applications. This evaluation was based on questionnaires returned by 1824 students of which 436 performed the DNA lab‘read the language of the tumor’ [10]. Finally, a study on the effect of the DNA lab ‘read the lan- guage of the tumor’ on the attitude of the students towards bio- technology was published by Klop et al. (2009) [11]. This study was based on questionnaires ﬁlled out by 365 students who did not participate in any of the studies mentioned above. The results of these three studies are combined to come to an over-view of the impact of the module. RESULTS The Translation of the General Goals of the DNA Labs into an Instructional Design The general learning goal formulated for the DNA lab ‘read the language of the tumor’ is: •After performing the DNA lab, students are able to explain what modern DNA research related to cancerentails and how this research is used. To reach this goal three more speciﬁc learninggoals have been determined: •After
research is used. To reach this goal three more speciﬁc learninggoals have been determined: •After performing the DNA lab, students know that cancer is ‘a disease of the genes’ and they are ableto explain how one can minimize the risk of getting cancer. •After performing the DNA lab, students are able to perform practical steps in DNA analysis (DNA isola-tion, PCR, and gel electrophoresis) and they canexplain the purpose of each step. •After performing the DNA lab, students are able to explain that DNA-research is important to improvediagnosis and treatment of cancer. These more speciﬁc goals offer design criteria for the DNA lab. Other design criteria are derived from the con- text-concept approach, which is broadly accepted in sci- ence education innovation in the Netherlands [12]. This approach implies that students learn new concepts and practices in the societal or professional context, in which these concepts are used. The advantage of such an approach is that students rapidly understand the value ofthis knowledge and can relate it to their personal experi- ences and/or what they observe in the media. Further- more, they are thus taught concepts in a meaningful set- ting, which improves retention. A possible disadvantage is that students may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to apply the concepts learned in one context to another. To translate these goals into an instructional design, choices were made regarding context, techniques, genesto be investigated and format of the lessons. Context— The DNA lab ‘read the language of the tu- mor’ uses the context of a diagnostic DNA test on tumortissue to determine the best treatment for a ﬁctitious cancer patient. This patient is diagnosed with breast can- cer and the physician asks for an analysis of the muta-tions in the DNA of the tumor. The students are asked tocarry out this task and advise the physician on the opti-mal treatment for this particular patient. This context was chosen because it illustrates the three different ways
this particular patient. This context was chosen because it illustrates the three different ways knowledge about speciﬁc gene mutations225  15393429, 2010, 4, Downloaded from https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bmb.20397 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2024].

can be used: ﬁrst to understand the genetic changes that lead to cancer, second, to properly diagnose tumors withdifferent genetic make ups and third, to design tailoredtreatment strategies based on the genetic make up of atumor. Through this context students learn that cancer iscaused by multiple gene mutations, that cancer patientscan be further diagnosed by gene analysis, and that knowledge about the speciﬁc genes that are mutated in a tumor and the biological effects such mutations have canprovide a basis for personalized treatment. Techniques— Within this context, steps in the diagnostic practice should include isolating DNA from tumor and nor-mal cells, and comparing selected genes in tumor cellswith those in normal cells. Techniques to illustrate thispractice were chosen with the following criteria in mind: •Authenticity: techniques must be used in real prac- tice •Comprehension: techniques must be understood by students of the age of 16–18 years •Complexity: techniques that can be performed by inexperienced students •Transportability: techniques that can easily be trans- ported to and set up at schools •Time: techniques that offer results within the time constraints of the module •Cost: techniques that rely on equipment and materi- als that ﬁt within the set budget •Safety: techniques that rely on equipment and mate- rials that can be safely used in a school environment In authentic clinical practice, gene mutation analysis on tumor tissue is performed by sequencing the regionof interest and using bioinformatics tools to detect muta-tions. However, using such sequencing techniques in a mobile DNA lab would be too complex, too time con- suming and too expensive. Therefore, the techniquesselected for the mobile lab are a simple version of DNAisolation, ampliﬁcation by PCR, and analysis by gel elec-trophoresis on agarose gel. Due to technical and legallimitations, it was decided to have students isolate DNA from calf thymus to illustrate the principles of DNA
it was decided to have students isolate DNA from calf thymus to illustrate the principles of DNA isola-tion and to use plasmid based fragments to obtain thePCR products that simulate the ﬁctitious results we wantthe students to analyze. The PCR is performed with PCRtubes containing ready-to-go 2beads that include nucle- otides and Taq polymerase. Students only have to add DNA and primers to the tubes and the small inserts used in these plasmids make it possible to use a very shortPCR protocol that ﬁts within a 2 hour module. The three techniques performed in the classroom are illustrated in Fig. 1. Genes— Gene mutations were selected based on the following criteria: •The mutated genes must represent different steps in the process from a normal cell to a tumor cell todemonstrate that cancer is caused by multiple muta-tions. •The mutated genes must have implications for the choice of therapy to demonstrate that current thera-pies are based on speciﬁc mutations in tumor cells. •The gene mutations must be diagnosable by gel electrophoresis following PCR-ampliﬁcation. •The function of the mutated genes must be compre- hendible for students in upper-secondary education. We chose a combination of three mutations that fulﬁll these criteria: a p53 deletion, HER2 ampliﬁcation and a CDH1 truncation. Students identify mutations in these genes by comparing PCR fragments obtained from DNA from in healthy cells and tumor cells. An example of the result of the gel electrophoresis is shown inFig. 2. •A deletion of the p53 gene results in the absence of ap53 fragment in the tumor cell PCR product. Stu- dents can conclude that the absence of p53 will lead to the loss of apoptosis (programmed celldeath), which is one of the characteristic features of FIG. 1.

cancer cells. Their conclusion concerning the treat- ment can be: the tumor cells are not able to destroythemselves, thus therapy must be aimed at removingor destroying cancer cells. Options are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. •AHER2 gene ampliﬁcation leads to an over-expres- sion and thereby autoactivation of HER2 receptors at the plasma membrane. A HER2 gene ampliﬁcation is illustrated by an increased quantity of HER2 PCR product from tumor cells compared to healthy cells.Students conclude that an ampliﬁcation of this generesults in the presence of an excess of growthreceptors causing the cell to be continually stimu-lated to divide. Students are told that screening forHER2 positive breast cancer is common clinical practice. They are asked to think of a treatment that will stop overstimulation of HER2 positive cells. In our experience, almost every group of students comesup with the idea of blocking the receptor. This isexactly the mechanism by which Trastuzumab (Her-ceptin 1) blocks growth of HER2 positive tumors. So the advice to the physician will be Trastuzumabtreatment. •Due to its role in cell junctions, truncation of the CDH1 (e-cadherin) gene may result in incorrect cell adhesion. From the differences in the size of the PCR fragments, students conclude that part of the e-cadherin protein is missing, which may lead totumor cells not adhering correctly. Students hypothe-size that this mutation increases the risk of metasta-sis and they advise the physician to check forsecondary tumors and use chemotherapy as atreatment.Format— The practical work is guided by university bachelor students that visit the school with the necessary equipment. Introductory and concluding lessons are taught by the teacher. In this way, the teacher partici-pates actively in the lessons, thereby linking the lab toregular biology education. The aim of the introductory lesson is to activate prior knowledge about cancer and to relate known molecularconcepts such as DNA, gene,
to activate prior knowledge about cancer and to relate known molecularconcepts such as DNA, gene, and protein to cancer. Stu-dents formulate their own questions about cancer, forexample, ‘is cancer age-dependent?’ ‘What is the role ofheredity in cancer?’ ‘What is the difference between be-nign and malignant tumors?’ During the module students try to ﬁnd answers to these questions, thereby relating biological knowledge to real-world questions and prob-lems. The ﬁnal lesson is used to look back at the results of the experiment and to stimulate the students to think ofpersonal and societal implications of cancer genomicsresearch. Effects of the DNA Lab ‘Read the Language of the Tumor’ The effect of the DNA lab can be speciﬁed in the implementation of the instructional design of the entiremodule, the outreach volume and appreciation of the lab,the learning outcomes, and the effects on studentattitude. Implementation— Interviews with teachers indicate that not all teachers perform the introductory and ﬁnal lesson. Reasons differ, from lack of time to the conviction that the students already have enough prior knowledge tocarry out the practical. The exact percentage of teachersthat perform these lessons is at present unknown. How-ever, from the number of students that answered ques-tions about these lessons in the questionnaires, it is esti-mated that from 325 students about 75% had an intro-ductory lesson and about 64% were given a concludinglesson [10]. In some cases, only the results of the practi-cal were discussed in the ﬁnal lesson without furtherreﬂection on the personal and societal implications of cancer genomics research. Outreach Volume and Appreciation— From the start of the project in September 2005 until June 2009, the ﬁvemobile labs reached 54,000 students in 342 differentschools, which means that 64% of the Dutch secondaryschools were visited and about 35% of all students inupper-secondary biology education experienced one ormore DNA labs during their
of all students inupper-secondary biology education experienced one ormore DNA labs during their school career. The DNA lab‘read the language of the tumor’ reached 188 differentschools and 17,000 students during the same period. From the point of view of the research institutes and universities involved, the ‘DNA labs on the road’ are a powerful outreach activity. After performing the DNA lab,16% of the students indicate that they consider a studyin the natural sciences as a result of having done theDNA lab ‘read the language of the tumor’ [10]. In general, both teachers and students are very enthu- siastic about the module and consider it relevant. They FIG. 2. Differences in PCR fragments analyzed using gel electrophoresis.

appreciate university students visiting the school and the possibility to work with modern equipment. Students ﬁndthe practical instructive, interesting, and fascinating andthey consider the context of cancer research appealingand motivating (score 4.16 on a ﬁve-point Likert scale).These ﬁndings are conﬁrmed in the evaluation of all ﬁvelabs performed by Knippels [10]. In this study, only 10%of the 1824 students indicated that they did not like theDNA lab. Teachers experience the DNA lab to be a good addi- tion to the regular curriculum and most of them indicate that they want to continue using the ‘DNA lab on the road’. Learning Outcomes— Analysis of the materials, class- room observations during the module and interviewswith teachers shows that almost all the speciﬁc learninggoals formulated are reached and that the module doesindeed contribute to the students’ knowledge ofgenomics. Results of the questionnaires show that afterperforming the DNA lab, students consider themselvescapable of explaining the importance of DNA-researchin hospitals in the context of cancer diagnosis (score 4.25 on a ﬁve-point Likert scale). When asked to com- plete the sentence ‘the main message of this DNA labis...’ 80% of the students report ‘ ...how DNA and cancer research is performed’. In interviews studentsindicate that their biggest learning experience resultedfrom studying the function of the three genes. The factthat different characteristics of tumors are caused bymutations in different genes and the idea that therapiescan be tailored based on analysis of these mutationsare a novel insight for secondary-school students. Afterthe module, students know that cancer is ‘a disease of the genes’ but not all students grasped the principle that multiple mutations are needed to turn a healthy cellinto a tumor cell. In the questionnaire, about 30% ofthe students answer that one mutation in the DNA cancause cancer. The exact relation between DNA andcancer is difﬁcult to describe for a lot
the DNA cancause cancer. The exact relation between DNA andcancer is difﬁcult to describe for a lot of students.About 5% of the students state that: ‘by analyzing apersons DNA you can see if there is a tumor in thebody.’ Also the relation ‘gene–protein-function’ appearsto remain unclear to many students. Although this cen-tral dogma ought to be prior knowledge even before the introductory lesson, university students that teach the practical report that this concept is one of the mostdifﬁcult elements in the module. These experiences cor-respond with studies in molecular biology and geneticseducation reporting that concepts at the molecular level,such as gene and protein, can be very difﬁcult for stu-dents. [7, 9, 13] Relating these concepts to higher-levelphenomena, such as cell division (on the cellular level)or cancer (on the organism level) appears also to bevery difﬁcult [14–17]. One of the goals of the DNA labs is to increase the notion of societal implications of genomics research. As mentioned before, students consider themselves capableof explaining the importance of DNA research in hospi-tals in the context of cancer diagnosis (score 4.25). How-ever, an increased notion of societal implications ofgenomics research also implies better grounded viewson ethical dilemmas and enhancement of opinion-form- ing skills to judge societal implication. In this respect, thestudy of Knippels (2006) [10] reveals that students reportlittle enhancement of opinion-forming skills and bettergrounded views on ethical dilemmas. Analysis of theinstructional design of the module shows that no speciﬁcclassroom activities are incorporated in the module toenhance opinion-forming skills and reﬂection on ethicaldilemmas. Improvements can be made to meet thesegoals. Effects on Attitude— The module stimulates a positive attitude towards DNA-research (see also Klop, 2009) [11]. All students indicate that they are positive aboutDNA research. Not surprisingly, 80% of the studentsreport
indicate that they are positive aboutDNA research. Not surprisingly, 80% of the studentsreport improved diagnosis and treatment of diseases,mainly cancer, as a reason for this opinion. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION Our results show that most goals of the DNA lab are reached, namely: enhancing up-to-date genomics knowl- edge; improving the image and attitude towardsgenomics topics; increasing the notion of societal impli-cations of genomics research and invoking enthusiasmand interest in genomics research. However, some points for improvement remain. More attention should be paid to students’ opinion forming onpersonal and societal implications of genomics research.This is in line with previous research [11]. In new versionsof the DNA labs, speciﬁc lessons on opinion forminghave been developed and are now being tested. Also, the coherence between different biological con- cepts and biological levels of organization could be made more explicit. This has been attended to in thenew versions by including a framework, in which stu-dents can categorize concepts, relations, and questions[3]. This framework includes the levels of biological orga-nization and has the function of an ‘advanced organizer’in the learning process [18]. The framework is in linewith the current pedagogical approach in biology educa-tion in the Netherlands, i.e. the use of systems thinking,and learning concepts in the context in which they areused. Another ﬁnding is that the importance of the introduc- tory lesson and ﬁnal lesson is being under-rated byteachers. The study of Knippels (2006) [10] shows thatthis is the case for all ﬁve DNA labs. Teachers indicatethat they wish to have more background on currentgenomics research and support on the content anddidactics of the module. To meet this need and to ensurethe correct implementation of the introductory and ﬁnallessons, a teacher training course was developed inwhich these aspects are combined. This one day courseis offered twice a year at Utrecht
developed inwhich these aspects are combined. This one day courseis offered twice a year at Utrecht University. The practical work in the DNA lab ‘read the language of the tumor’ is guided by third year bachelor students(age 20–22) of the biomedical sciences program atUtrecht University. Although the results show that teach-ers and students highly appreciate the way universitystudents teach the lab, some improvements were madein the students’ training program. Their training and par-228 BAMBED, Vol. 38, No. 4, pp. 224–229, 2010  15393429, 2010, 4, Downloaded from https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bmb.20397 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2024].

ticipation in the DNA lab is now embedded in an optional 10 week (2 days/week) university course on sciencecommunication offered by the Cancer Genomics Centre,of which two weeks are used for training and reﬂectionand eight for teaching the lab in schools. In this way, theDNA lab offers students a unique training and practicalexperience in science communication within their univer-sity curriculum. In summary, the context of cancer research is very much appreciated by the students and teachers. Stu-dents can perform and understand the techniques and the materials and equipment are interesting and appeal- ing to them. Most of the cognitive and affective goals arereached and improvements have been made to optimizethe module. Thus, we wish to conclude that the DNA lab‘read the language of the tumor’ is a good example ofrelevant and up-to-date genomics education. Initiatives with similar goals have recently started in Europe. For instance, in France the Strasbourg UniversityPh.D School Life and Health Sciences launched an initia-tive called ‘OpenLab’ (http://www-ed-sdvs.u-strasbg.fr/openlab/). The European Molecular Biology Laboratory offers in-house training for secondary-school teachers called ‘the European Learning Laboratory for the LifeSciences’ (ELLS) (http://www.embl.de/training/scienceforschools/). We hope that these initiatives can inspire otherresearch institutes, didactics experts and teachers tocooperate in designing relevant and up-to-date genomicseducation.

These mobileDNA labs offer upper-secondary students the opportunity to experience genomics research through experiments with laboratory equipment that is not available in schools and place genomics research in a relevant societal context. The design of the DNA lab ‘read the language of the tumor’ is evaluated, byclarifying the goals and choices in the design, and the effects of the DNA lab are presented. Based on the analysis of the design of the DNA lab and supported by the results of the evaluating studies, we con- sider this module to be a good example of relevant and up-to-date genomics education. Keywords : High school, genomics, outreach, laboratory exercises, tumor biology. Rapid advances in molecular biology increase the gap between research practice and school science. Implica-tions of genomics research are rapidly ﬁnding their wayto everyday practice. Major breakthroughs range frommedicine to forensics, biofuels, vaccine research, and mitigation of pollution [1]. These scientiﬁc advances each bring their own choices and dilemmas. To empowerfuture citizens to deal with these personal and societaldecisions science education based on relevant andup-to-date science is needed. Many advances in molecular life sciences are not yet represented in science curricula [2, 3]. However, simplyadding new content without rethinking the curriculum isnot
science curricula [2, 3]. However, simplyadding new content without rethinking the curriculum isnot a viable strategy. In several countries, new curriculaconcerning molecular life sciences have been proposedor introduced [2, 4–6]. Advances in genomics research have caused fundamental changes in the scientiﬁc view on the inner working of the living cell, while secondary-school students still have problems grasping the basicconcepts of DNA and proteins [7–9]. Since 2006, an extracurricular development in the Netherlands aims to bridge the gap between school sci-ence and molecular biology research practice. The DutchGenomics Centres of Excellence and the Centre for Soci-ety & Genomics, which are part of the Netherlands Genomics Initiative (NGI), developed the ‘DNA labs onthe road’. These mobile DNA labs offer students the op-portunity to experience genomics research throughexperiments with laboratory equipment that is not avail- able in schools. Five different ‘DNA labs on the road’ were developed in collaboration with Dutch universities.The 4-hour educational modules for secondary-schoolstudents (ages 16–18) include an introductory lesson, a2-hour practical taught at school by university studentsand a ﬁnal lesson. Teacher and student manuals havebeen developed for each lab and are made available inadvance of the introductory lesson. The labs are offeredfree of charge to all secondary schools in the Nether-lands since January 2006. Costs for equipment, transportand training the students are covered by the genomics research centers, which are funded in part by the Nether- lands Genomics Initiative (NGI: www.genomics.nl). Teach-ers can obtain additional information and register for thelabs on the DNA lab website (www.DNAlabs.eu). Thepractical work of the lab takes 2 hours. Taking travel timeinto account, the university students can teach the lab toa maximum of two different classes within the sameschool in 1 day. GOALS OF THE ‘DNA LABS ON THE ROAD’ The DNA labs are an

Dutch upper-secondary education. The speciﬁc experi- ments performed in the DNA labs differ, but in each casethe students perform hands-on laboratory activities, suchas DNA isolation, analyzing DNA using Polymerase ChainReaction (PCR) and bioinformatics tools, in their ownclassroom. The ‘DNA labs on the road’ thus offergenomics techniques in the classroom. More importantly,the DNA labs provide students a context, in which newinsights in genomics are used to solve everyday prob-lems. The DNA labs deal with different contexts: produc-ing biofuels, plant breeding, forensics, and use of bioin- formatics in crime scene investigations and improving the understanding and treatment of diseases such asAlzheimer’s and cancer. These topics all rely ongenomics research and they reﬂect the research activ-ities of the genomics centers in the Netherlands. TheDNA labs show that genomics research plays an impor-tant role in society and they encourage reﬂection on thepersonal and societal implications of genomics research.These different aspects are summarized in the goals ofthe DNA labs formulated at the start of the project. The DNA labs aim at: •Enhancing up-to-date genomics knowledge •Improving the image and attitude towards genomics topics •Increasing the notion of societal implications of genomics research (place genomics in a societalcontext) •Invoking enthusiasm and interest in genomics research These goals have been the starting point for designing the DNA labs. In each of the DNA labs, these generalgoals were further speciﬁed and translated into aninstructional design. Several studies were performed totest whether the formulated goals had been reached. In this article, we focus on just one of the DNA labs named ‘read the language of the tumor’. This module oncancer research was developed by the Cancer Genomics Centre (CGC) in collaboration with the Freudenthal Insti- tute for Science and Mathematics Education (FIsme) ofUtrecht University. The questions addressed in this
for Science and Mathematics Education (FIsme) ofUtrecht University. The questions addressed in this article are: 1). How are the general goals of the DNA labs trans- lated into an instructional design? 2). To what extent have the educational goals been reached by this design? MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed the instructional design, the classroom practice, the results in student and teacher appreciation and learning outcomes, and the contribution both to the goals of the NGIand the innovation of biology education. We made use of study of the scientiﬁc literature, analysis of the educational materials of the module and of the student-as- sistant training course, interviews with people involved in theproject, classroom observations, focus group interviews, ques-tionnaires, and analysis of results of the assignments in the module. Parallel to this study, an evaluation of ﬁve of the DNA labs was performed regarding their quality, their learning outcomesand their effect on the attitude of the students toward genomics applications. This evaluation was based on questionnaires returned by 1824 students of which 436 performed the DNA lab‘read the language of the tumor’ [10]. Finally, a study on the effect of the DNA lab ‘read the lan- guage of the tumor’ on the attitude of the students towards bio- technology was published by Klop et al. (2009) [11]. This study was based on questionnaires ﬁlled out by 365 students who did not participate in any of the studies mentioned above. The results of these three studies are combined to come to an over-view of the impact of the module. RESULTS The Translation of the General Goals of the DNA Labs into an Instructional Design The general learning goal formulated for the DNA lab ‘read the language of the tumor’ is: •After performing the DNA lab, students are able to explain what modern DNA research related to cancerentails and how this research is used. To reach this goal three more speciﬁc learninggoals have been determined: •After
research is used. To reach this goal three more speciﬁc learninggoals have been determined: •After performing the DNA lab, students know that cancer is ‘a disease of the genes’ and they are ableto explain how one can minimize the risk of getting cancer. •After performing the DNA lab, students are able to perform practical steps in DNA analysis (DNA isola-tion, PCR, and gel electrophoresis) and they canexplain the purpose of each step. •After performing the DNA lab, students are able to explain that DNA-research is important to improvediagnosis and treatment of cancer. These more speciﬁc goals offer design criteria for the DNA lab. Other design criteria are derived from the con- text-concept approach, which is broadly accepted in sci- ence education innovation in the Netherlands [12]. This approach implies that students learn new concepts and practices in the societal or professional context, in which these concepts are used. The advantage of such an approach is that students rapidly understand the value ofthis knowledge and can relate it to their personal experi- ences and/or what they observe in the media. Further- more, they are thus taught concepts in a meaningful set- ting, which improves retention. A possible disadvantage is that students may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to apply the concepts learned in one context to another. To translate these goals into an instructional design, choices were made regarding context, techniques, genesto be investigated and format of the lessons. Context— The DNA lab ‘read the language of the tu- mor’ uses the context of a diagnostic DNA test on tumortissue to determine the best treatment for a ﬁctitious cancer patient. This patient is diagnosed with breast can- cer and the physician asks for an analysis of the muta-tions in the DNA of the tumor. The students are asked tocarry out this task and advise the physician on the opti-mal treatment for this particular patient. This context was chosen because it illustrates the three different ways
this particular patient. This context was chosen because it illustrates the three different ways knowledge about speciﬁc gene mutations225  15393429, 2010, 4, Downloaded from https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bmb.20397 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2024].

can be used: ﬁrst to understand the genetic changes that lead to cancer, second, to properly diagnose tumors withdifferent genetic make ups and third, to design tailoredtreatment strategies based on the genetic make up of atumor. Through this context students learn that cancer iscaused by multiple gene mutations, that cancer patientscan be further diagnosed by gene analysis, and that knowledge about the speciﬁc genes that are mutated in a tumor and the biological effects such mutations have canprovide a basis for personalized treatment. Techniques— Within this context, steps in the diagnostic practice should include isolating DNA from tumor and nor-mal cells, and comparing selected genes in tumor cellswith those in normal cells. Techniques to illustrate thispractice were chosen with the following criteria in mind: •Authenticity: techniques must be used in real prac- tice •Comprehension: techniques must be understood by students of the age of 16–18 years •Complexity: techniques that can be performed by inexperienced students •Transportability: techniques that can easily be trans- ported to and set up at schools •Time: techniques that offer results within the time constraints of the module •Cost: techniques that rely on equipment and materi- als that ﬁt within the set budget •Safety: techniques that rely on equipment and mate- rials that can be safely used in a school environment In authentic clinical practice, gene mutation analysis on tumor tissue is performed by sequencing the regionof interest and using bioinformatics tools to detect muta-tions. However, using such sequencing techniques in a mobile DNA lab would be too complex, too time con- suming and too expensive. Therefore, the techniquesselected for the mobile lab are a simple version of DNAisolation, ampliﬁcation by PCR, and analysis by gel elec-trophoresis on agarose gel. Due to technical and legallimitations, it was decided to have students isolate DNA from calf thymus to illustrate the principles of DNA
it was decided to have students isolate DNA from calf thymus to illustrate the principles of DNA isola-tion and to use plasmid based fragments to obtain thePCR products that simulate the ﬁctitious results we wantthe students to analyze. The PCR is performed with PCRtubes containing ready-to-go 2beads that include nucle- otides and Taq polymerase. Students only have to add DNA and primers to the tubes and the small inserts used in these plasmids make it possible to use a very shortPCR protocol that ﬁts within a 2 hour module. The three techniques performed in the classroom are illustrated in Fig. 1. Genes— Gene mutations were selected based on the following criteria: •The mutated genes must represent different steps in the process from a normal cell to a tumor cell todemonstrate that cancer is caused by multiple muta-tions. •The mutated genes must have implications for the choice of therapy to demonstrate that current thera-pies are based on speciﬁc mutations in tumor cells. •The gene mutations must be diagnosable by gel electrophoresis following PCR-ampliﬁcation. •The function of the mutated genes must be compre- hendible for students in upper-secondary education. We chose a combination of three mutations that fulﬁll these criteria: a p53 deletion, HER2 ampliﬁcation and a CDH1 truncation. Students identify mutations in these genes by comparing PCR fragments obtained from DNA from in healthy cells and tumor cells. An example of the result of the gel electrophoresis is shown inFig. 2. •A deletion of the p53 gene results in the absence of ap53 fragment in the tumor cell PCR product. Stu- dents can conclude that the absence of p53 will lead to the loss of apoptosis (programmed celldeath), which is one of the characteristic features of FIG. 1. The three techniques in the practical: (A) student isolating DNA from calf thymus (B) PCR tubes placed in the ther- mocycler (C) student using a simple micropipette to load the PCR products on the agarose gel.226 BAMBED, Vol. 38,

cancer cells. Their conclusion concerning the treat- ment can be: the tumor cells are not able to destroythemselves, thus therapy must be aimed at removingor destroying cancer cells. Options are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. •AHER2 gene ampliﬁcation leads to an over-expres- sion and thereby autoactivation of HER2 receptors at the plasma membrane. A HER2 gene ampliﬁcation is illustrated by an increased quantity of HER2 PCR product from tumor cells compared to healthy cells.Students conclude that an ampliﬁcation of this generesults in the presence of an excess of growthreceptors causing the cell to be continually stimu-lated to divide. Students are told that screening forHER2 positive breast cancer is common clinical practice. They are asked to think of a treatment that will stop overstimulation of HER2 positive cells. In our experience, almost every group of students comesup with the idea of blocking the receptor. This isexactly the mechanism by which Trastuzumab (Her-ceptin 1) blocks growth of HER2 positive tumors. So the advice to the physician will be Trastuzumabtreatment. •Due to its role in cell junctions, truncation of the CDH1 (e-cadherin) gene may result in incorrect cell adhesion. From the differences in the size of the PCR fragments, students conclude that part of the e-cadherin protein is missing, which may lead totumor cells not adhering correctly. Students hypothe-size that this mutation increases the risk of metasta-sis and they advise the physician to check forsecondary tumors and use chemotherapy as atreatment.Format— The practical work is guided by university bachelor students that visit the school with the necessary equipment. Introductory and concluding lessons are taught by the teacher. In this way, the teacher partici-pates actively in the lessons, thereby linking the lab toregular biology education. The aim of the introductory lesson is to activate prior knowledge about cancer and to relate known molecularconcepts such as DNA, gene,
to activate prior knowledge about cancer and to relate known molecularconcepts such as DNA, gene, and protein to cancer. Stu-dents formulate their own questions about cancer, forexample, ‘is cancer age-dependent?’ ‘What is the role ofheredity in cancer?’ ‘What is the difference between be-nign and malignant tumors?’ During the module students try to ﬁnd answers to these questions, thereby relating biological knowledge to real-world questions and prob-lems. The ﬁnal lesson is used to look back at the results of the experiment and to stimulate the students to think ofpersonal and societal implications of cancer genomicsresearch. Effects of the DNA Lab ‘Read the Language of the Tumor’ The effect of the DNA lab can be speciﬁed in the implementation of the instructional design of the entiremodule, the outreach volume and appreciation of the lab,the learning outcomes, and the effects on studentattitude. Implementation— Interviews with teachers indicate that not all teachers perform the introductory and ﬁnal lesson. Reasons differ, from lack of time to the conviction that the students already have enough prior knowledge tocarry out the practical. The exact percentage of teachersthat perform these lessons is at present unknown. How-ever, from the number of students that answered ques-tions about these lessons in the questionnaires, it is esti-mated that from 325 students about 75% had an intro-ductory lesson and about 64% were given a concludinglesson [10]. In some cases, only the results of the practi-cal were discussed in the ﬁnal lesson without furtherreﬂection on the personal and societal implications of cancer genomics research. Outreach Volume and Appreciation— From the start of the project in September 2005 until June 2009, the ﬁvemobile labs reached 54,000 students in 342 differentschools, which means that 64% of the Dutch secondaryschools were visited and about 35% of all students inupper-secondary biology education experienced one ormore DNA labs during their
of all students inupper-secondary biology education experienced one ormore DNA labs during their school career. The DNA lab‘read the language of the tumor’ reached 188 differentschools and 17,000 students during the same period. From the point of view of the research institutes and universities involved, the ‘DNA labs on the road’ are a powerful outreach activity. After performing the DNA lab,16% of the students indicate that they consider a studyin the natural sciences as a result of having done theDNA lab ‘read the language of the tumor’ [10]. In general, both teachers and students are very enthu- siastic about the module and consider it relevant. They FIG. 2. Differences in PCR fragments analyzed using gel electrophoresis.

appreciate university students visiting the school and the possibility to work with modern equipment. Students ﬁndthe practical instructive, interesting, and fascinating andthey consider the context of cancer research appealingand motivating (score 4.16 on a ﬁve-point Likert scale).These ﬁndings are conﬁrmed in the evaluation of all ﬁvelabs performed by Knippels [10]. In this study, only 10%of the 1824 students indicated that they did not like theDNA lab. Teachers experience the DNA lab to be a good addi- tion to the regular curriculum and most of them indicate that they want to continue using the ‘DNA lab on the road’. Learning Outcomes— Analysis of the materials, class- room observations during the module and interviewswith teachers shows that almost all the speciﬁc learninggoals formulated are reached and that the module doesindeed contribute to the students’ knowledge ofgenomics. Results of the questionnaires show that afterperforming the DNA lab, students consider themselvescapable of explaining the importance of DNA-researchin hospitals in the context of cancer diagnosis (score 4.25 on a ﬁve-point Likert scale). When asked to com- plete the sentence ‘the main message of this DNA labis...’ 80% of the students report ‘ ...how DNA and cancer research is performed’. In interviews studentsindicate that their biggest learning experience resultedfrom studying the function of the three genes. The factthat different characteristics of tumors are caused bymutations in different genes and the idea that therapiescan be tailored based on analysis of these mutationsare a novel insight for secondary-school students. Afterthe module, students know that cancer is ‘a disease of the genes’ but not all students grasped the principle that multiple mutations are needed to turn a healthy cellinto a tumor cell. In the questionnaire, about 30% ofthe students answer that one mutation in the DNA cancause cancer. The exact relation between DNA andcancer is difﬁcult to describe for a lot
the DNA cancause cancer. The exact relation between DNA andcancer is difﬁcult to describe for a lot of students.About 5% of the students state that: ‘by analyzing apersons DNA you can see if there is a tumor in thebody.’ Also the relation ‘gene–protein-function’ appearsto remain unclear to many students. Although this cen-tral dogma ought to be prior knowledge even before the introductory lesson, university students that teach the practical report that this concept is one of the mostdifﬁcult elements in the module. These experiences cor-respond with studies in molecular biology and geneticseducation reporting that concepts at the molecular level,such as gene and protein, can be very difﬁcult for stu-dents. [7, 9, 13] Relating these concepts to higher-levelphenomena, such as cell division (on the cellular level)or cancer (on the organism level) appears also to bevery difﬁcult [14–17]. One of the goals of the DNA labs is to increase the notion of societal implications of genomics research. As mentioned before, students consider themselves capableof explaining the importance of DNA research in hospi-tals in the context of cancer diagnosis (score 4.25). How-ever, an increased notion of societal implications ofgenomics research also implies better grounded viewson ethical dilemmas and enhancement of opinion-form- ing skills to judge societal implication. In this respect, thestudy of Knippels (2006) [10] reveals that students reportlittle enhancement of opinion-forming skills and bettergrounded views on ethical dilemmas. Analysis of theinstructional design of the module shows that no speciﬁcclassroom activities are incorporated in the module toenhance opinion-forming skills and reﬂection on ethicaldilemmas. Improvements can be made to meet thesegoals. Effects on Attitude— The module stimulates a positive attitude towards DNA-research (see also Klop, 2009) [11]. All students indicate that they are positive aboutDNA research. Not surprisingly, 80% of the studentsreport
indicate that they are positive aboutDNA research. Not surprisingly, 80% of the studentsreport improved diagnosis and treatment of diseases,mainly cancer, as a reason for this opinion. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION Our results show that most goals of the DNA lab are reached, namely: enhancing up-to-date genomics knowl- edge; improving the image and attitude towardsgenomics topics; increasing the notion of societal impli-cations of genomics research and invoking enthusiasmand interest in genomics research. However, some points for improvement remain. More attention should be paid to students’ opinion forming onpersonal and societal implications of genomics research.This is in line with previous research [11]. In new versionsof the DNA labs, speciﬁc lessons on opinion forminghave been developed and are now being tested. Also, the coherence between different biological con- cepts and biological levels of organization could be made more explicit. This has been attended to in thenew versions by including a framework, in which stu-dents can categorize concepts, relations, and questions[3]. This framework includes the levels of biological orga-nization and has the function of an ‘advanced organizer’in the learning process [18]. The framework is in linewith the current pedagogical approach in biology educa-tion in the Netherlands, i.e. the use of systems thinking,and learning concepts in the context in which they areused. Another ﬁnding is that the importance of the introduc- tory lesson and ﬁnal lesson is being under-rated byteachers. The study of Knippels (2006) [10] shows thatthis is the case for all ﬁve DNA labs. Teachers indicatethat they wish to have more background on currentgenomics research and support on the content anddidactics of the module. To meet this need and to ensurethe correct implementation of the introductory and ﬁnallessons, a teacher training course was developed inwhich these aspects are combined. This one day courseis offered twice a year at Utrecht
developed inwhich these aspects are combined. This one day courseis offered twice a year at Utrecht University. The practical work in the DNA lab ‘read the language of the tumor’ is guided by third year bachelor students(age 20–22) of the biomedical sciences program atUtrecht University. Although the results show that teach-ers and students highly appreciate the way universitystudents teach the lab, some improvements were madein the students’ training program. Their training and par-228 BAMBED, Vol. 38, No. 4, pp. 224–229, 2010  15393429, 2010, 4, Downloaded from https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bmb.20397 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [23/07/2024].

ticipation in the DNA lab is now embedded in an optional 10 week (2 days/week) university course on sciencecommunication offered by the Cancer Genomics Centre,of which two weeks are used for training and reﬂectionand eight for teaching the lab in schools. In this way, theDNA lab offers students a unique training and practicalexperience in science communication within their univer-sity curriculum. In summary, the context of cancer research is very much appreciated by the students and teachers. Stu-dents can perform and understand the techniques and the materials and equipment are interesting and appeal- ing to them. Most of the cognitive and affective goals arereached and improvements have been made to optimizethe module. Thus, we wish to conclude that the DNA lab‘read the language of the tumor’ is a good example ofrelevant and up-to-date genomics education. Initiatives with similar goals have recently started in Europe. For instance, in France the Strasbourg UniversityPh.D School Life and Health Sciences launched an initia-tive called ‘OpenLab’ (http://www-ed-sdvs.u-strasbg.fr/openlab/). The European Molecular Biology Laboratory offers in-house training for secondary-school teachers called ‘the European Learning Laboratory for the LifeSciences’ (ELLS) (http://www.embl.de/training/scienceforschools/). We hope that these initiatives can inspire otherresearch institutes, didactics experts and teachers tocooperate in designing relevant and up-to-date genomicseducation.

El texto destaca la importancia de proporcionar a los estudiantes experiencias prácticas que les permitan participar en investigaciones de vanguardia y comprender las implicaciones sociales de la genómica. En respuesta a esta necesidad, los centros de investigación genómica holandeses han desarrollado laboratorios móviles de ADN que llevan prácticas de investigación genómica modernas directamente a los estudiantes de secundaria. Estos laboratorios, conocidos como 'DNA labs on the road', brindan a los estudiantes la oportunidad de realizar experimentos utilizando equipos de laboratorio especializados que normalmente no están disponibles en entornos escolares. Al situar la investigación genómica en un contexto social relevante, los DNA labs buscan cerrar la brecha entre la práctica de investigación y el plan de estudios escolar.

El módulo específico del laboratorio de ADN evaluado en este estudio se titula 'lee el lenguaje del tumor'. Los investigadores analizan los objetivos y las elecciones de diseño de este módulo, así como sus efectos en el aprendizaje de los estudiantes. A través de su evaluación, concluyen que el módulo del laboratorio de ADN es un ejemplo exitoso de educación genómica relevante y actualizada.

El estudio destaca la importancia de incorporar avances científicos actuales, como los de la genómica, en la educación científica. Al proporcionar a los estudiantes experiencias prácticas y exponerlos a aplicaciones del mundo real de la investigación genómica, los educadores pueden preparar mejor a los futuros ciudadanos para tomar decisiones informadas sobre cuestiones personales y sociales relacionadas con la genómica.

En general, la evaluación del módulo del laboratorio de ADN demuestra la efectividad de utilizar laboratorios móviles para mejorar la educación genómica en las escuelas secundarias. Al involucrar a los estudiantes en ejercicios de laboratorio centrados en la biología tumoral, el módulo ayuda a los estudiantes a comprender las aplicaciones prácticas de la investigación genómica y los anima a considerar las implicaciones éticas y sociales de los avances científicos.
