The relative importance of work experience, extra-curricular and university-based activities on student employability Denise Jacksonaand Michael Tomlinsonb aSchool of Business and Law, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia;bEducation, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK ABSTRACT Declining graduate labour markets, perceived devaluing of degree qualiﬁcations, and intense focus on graduate employment metrics have increased pressure on universities to enhance their students ’ employability. Formal curricula developments have beenaccompanied by co-curricular and extra-curricular o ﬀerings intended to enhance students ’career readiness and emerging graduate pro ﬁles. Using survey data from undergraduate and postgraduate students in an Australian and UK university ( N= 352), multivariate techniques examined participation inemployability-related activities and students ’perceptions of their importance for their employability. Data revealed di ﬀerential participation based on student pro ﬁle characteristics and the type of activity undertaken. Overall, these were valued for boosting a range of employability-related facets, including networks, learning about future career and pro ﬁle attractiveness to employers. The more aligned these activities were to intended career outcomes, the more importance they were ascribed. The implications of these ﬁndings for enhancing employability-related oﬀerings in universities are discussed.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 6 November 2019 Accepted 7 February 2021 KEYWORDS Employability; extra-curricular; work experience; work-integrated learning; co- curricular Universities are under pressure to develop student employability, driven by rising enrol- ments and increasing attention to the economic return of completing a degree (Sin et al., 2019). As such, they are expected to produce graduates with future-oriented capabilities that align with rapid changes in globalisation and digitalisation (Cawood et al., 2018). Despite the on-going debate
changes in globalisation and digitalisation (Cawood et al., 2018). Despite the on-going debate on whether graduate employability should play a key rolein shaping higher education (HE) policy and practice (see Smith et al., 2018), the prolifer- ation of employability-focused activities continues to grow (Bennett, 2019) and there remains a strong interest in their enhancement of student employability. The designand type of adopted activities may be de ﬁned by institutions ’strategic focus on employ- ability, such as achieving short-term employment outcomes, enhancing professional readiness and encouraging lifelong learning (Bridgstock & Jackson, 2019). This article focuses on the relative importance of activities designed to augment employability during university years. It recognises the complexity of employability(Jackson, 2016) and engages with a broader suite of employability outcomes beyond © 2021 HERDSACONTACT Denise Jackson d.jackson@ecu.edu.auHIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 2022, VOL. 41, NO. 4, 1119 –1135 https://doi.org/10.1080/07294360.2021.1901663
employment metrics (Jackson & Bridgstock, 2018), including building networks, gaining insight into the world-of-work, con ﬁdence in undertaking future roles, developing a pro- fessional pro ﬁle, motivation and goal-setting for future employment, and learning about future careers. Notably, the student perspective underpins our study, helping us to under- stand which activities aid in ‘gaining and sustaining work ’(Higdon, 2016, p. 176), to inform the e ﬀective development of employability (Andrewartha & Harvey, 2017). Despite considerable literature on tools, resources and approaches to developing student employability through curriculum-based, co-curricular or extra-curricular prac- tices, there remains limited empirical exploration of how they enhance employability, particularly from the student perspective (Tymon, 2013). This is surprising, given employability strategies attract performance indicators (Smith et al., 2018) and graduate employability outcomes are used to compare universities ’performance. Evaluating the perceived importance of employability-related activities may aid institutions’ prioritisa- tion of resources and support, important given crowded curricula (Smith et al., 2018) and time-poor students often being unable to engage in multiple employability-related activi-ties (Tomlinson, 2017). This is particularly problematic for equity groups whose engage- ment in co-curricular and extra-curricular employability activities can be limited bycaring and/or paid work commitments (Future Track, 2013). Our study, therefore, aims to evaluate student participation in employability-related activities and explore the perceived importance of work experience, and curriculum-based, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities for enhancing di ﬀerent dimensions of employability among student groups. Our article ﬁrst reviews the literature on employability-related activities, followed by the presentation of methodology, ﬁndings, and their implications for key
activities, followed by the presentation of methodology, ﬁndings, and their implications for key stakeholders. Activities for enhancing employability There has been much work on activities intended to develop student employability (e.g.,Higher Education Academy, 2012; Kinash et al., 2016), arising from perceived skill mis- matches and pressures on universities to demonstrate employability. These may bebroadly divided into extra-curricular (o ﬀerings beyond degree requirements and not delivered via university systems and processes), co-curricular (not formally part of stu-dents ’studies but administered by universities), and curriculum-based (formally embedded into studies as part of degree o ﬀerings, herein referred to as for-credit). Importantly, these categories ’boundaries can be blurred, particularly where university staﬀmay initiate extra-curricular activities [ECAs] (Clegg et al., 2010). Examples of for-credit activities include student exchanges, study tours, capstone initiatives, debates, competitions, skill programmes, and work-integrated learning(WIL). WIL has received signi ﬁcant attention as a pathway for enhancing student employability. It integrates industry and community engagement into student learningand assessment as part of degree studies (Jackson, 2018), and can be workplace-based (internships/practicums/placements) or virtual/campus-based (industry-based projects/ consultancies/simulations/research projects). It has proved bene ﬁcial for career develop- ment learning, perceived employability and network building (Smith et al., 2009). Also important is service-learning, where students undertake community-focused work to enhance professional capability and social responsibility (Palmer et al., 2010).1120 D. JACKSON AND M. TOMLINSON
Co-curricular o ﬀerings often emulate embedded activities, such as peer/industry men- toring, professional networking activities, and leadership programmes. Other examples include career-related workshops, networking events, seminars co-delivered with indus-try bodies and volunteering programmes. ECAs span engaging with clubs/communitiesand professional associations, and participating in career-related events, volunteering, and paid work. Students are increasingly aware of the competition for graduate roles and the need for positional advantage yet prioritising the most bene ﬁcial activities can be unclear (Thompson et al., 2013). Some universities manage this with structured award programmes that use ePortfolios, micro-credentials, and/or digital badges toguide students on achieving and evidencing their employability (Miller et al., 2020). Embedding employability activities helps students to make connections between their formal study and future employment yet requires discipline academics that are suitablyskilled and committed to developing di ﬀerent aspects of employability (Smith et al., 2018). Universities may otherwise opt for co-curricular provision that is designed and delivered by those familiar with employers ’expectations and good practice in developing employability. Central provision enables economies of scale and provides opportunitiesfor transdisciplinary learning, important for preparing students for diverse work settings.Evidence shows, however, that co-curricular and extra-curricular activities can disadvan- tage equity students who might beneﬁ t most from such interventions yet experience diﬃculties balancing them with study and other commitments (Thompson et al., 2013). Student participation in activities There are equity concerns for low socio-economic status students who already lack cul- tural and social capital and are less able to participate in ECAs due to limited networks and resource constraints (Bathmaker et al., 2016). ECA participation
ECAs due to limited networks and resource constraints (Bathmaker et al., 2016). ECA participation can also vary by dis- cipline, age and gender (Clark et al., 2015). Caring commitments reduce females ’overall participation (Stevenson & Clegg, 2011) and they undertake more paid work than males who tend to engage in sport (Clark et al., 2015). We, therefore, posed: RQ 1: How does student participation in ECAs vary with study and background characteristics? Evidence suggests student engagement in work experience, whether co-curricular, extra-curricular or for-credit (WIL), varies by study and background characteristics. Univer- sities Australia ( 2019), for example, found more Health/Education students participated compared with those from Commerce/Society/Culture, most likely due to course accred- itation requirements. While approximately one-half of students aged between 20 and 29 years participated in WIL, this was signi ﬁcantly lower for older groups. Those similar proportions of domestic and international students undertook WIL contravened earlier evidence of employers ’favouring domestic students, limiting international student access to internships (e.g., International Education Association of Australia [IEAA], 2012). Extra-curricular, unpaid internships are more prevalent in Law/Creative Arts (Interns Australia, 2015) and greater participation in paid work is reported for dom- estic students, females, those in later years of study, and students enrolled in ‘pro- fessional’ degrees, rather than generalist programmes such as Commerce/Humanities. To explore these variances, we asked:HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 1121
RQ 2: How does student participation in work experience vary with study and background characteristics? Gauging importance for employability When gauging the relative importance of employability-related activities, we chose not to explore academic performance, employment outcomes or professional capability devel-opment given extensive literature in these areas (Buckley & Lee, 2018). We instead eval- uated the activities’ relative importance for processual elements of employability (Smith et al., 2018) which impact education-to-work transition and achieving career goals. Holmes ( 2013) also supported refocusing our attention on employability outcomes beyond skills, capabilities and employment to processual aspects to ‘provide a basis for curriculum intervention ’(p. 551). More substantially, we drew on recent conceptualisations of employability (Bridgstock, 2016; Clarke, 2018; Jackson, 2016; Tomlinson, 2017) which highlight key dimensions of professional socialisation, networks, con ﬁdence in capabilities and perceived employabil- ity. Furthermore, recognising the intersection of employability and career development(Healy et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2009), we drew on the DOTS model of career development learning (Watts, 1977). This comprises four elements: decision-making, opportunity awareness, transition learning and self-awareness, and is proved to be relevant for HE stu-dents (Smith et al., 2009). The model emphasises the value of students understanding their strengths, interests and career preferences; proactively engaging in career planning; under- standing career and work opportunities; and e ﬀectively presenting themselves to prospec- tive employers. The perceived importance of activities was thus explored in terms of how well they enable students to expand their networks, gain insight into the world-of-work, be conﬁdent in undertaking future roles, develop a professional pro ﬁle, feel motivated and set goals for future employment, and learn about future
a professional pro ﬁle, feel motivated and set goals for future employment, and learn about future careers. Several studies have reported the positive beneﬁ ts of work experience, particularly when related to one ’s studies, on networking capabilities, building contacts for career purposes, resume building, improved goal-setting, and informed career decision- making from insight into available career pathways (see Bourner & Millican, 2011). In negotiating access to occupational ﬁelds, students with extensive work-related experience may have a ﬁrmer knowledge base of formal and informal labour markets, including opportunities and demands and how to adapt their pro ﬁles accordingly. This can enhance students ’emerging professional pro ﬁle, enabling them to di ﬀerentiate from other suitably quali ﬁed individuals. This led to: RQ 3: How do students perceive the importance of work experience for enhancing their employability? Kinash et al. ( 2016) reviewed numerous for-credit and co-curricular activities for enhan- cing employability using a multi-stakeholder approach. They reported discrepanciesamong students and employers on which strategies were most useful, with students favouring careers advice, ECAs, networking events, professional associations, and volun- teering. Despite important work on ways to enhance employability, their perceived use-fulness and how this may vary among students lacks empirical analysis. We, therefore,investigated:1122 D. JACKSON AND M. TOMLINSON
RQ 4: How do students perceive the importance of university-based interventions for learn- ing about their future career and does this vary by individual and study characteristics? Activities that build professional networks and bridge relations with signi ﬁcant others, especially those aligned with targeted ﬁelds, are critical for enhancing employability (Bridgstock, 2016). ECAs beyond work experience have proved beneﬁ cial for developing networks and networking capabilities yet may vary across equity groups (Buckley & Lee, 2018; Clark et al., 2015). We, therefore, asked: RQ 5: What activities and background characteristics in ﬂuence student development of pro- fessional networks? Material and methods Participants Three hundred and 52 undergraduate and postgraduate students from a research-inten- sive UK-based university ( N= 110) and a smaller Australian university ( N= 242) took part in the study. The geographical locations were selected given their countries ’ similar drivers for a graduate employability agenda and shared understanding thatemployability is core to HE business (Smith et al., 2018), along with comparable graduate labour markets and HE systems. The potential in ﬂuence of contextual di ﬀerences on ﬁndings should, however, be acknowledged. Diﬀerence in sample sizes was largely attrib- uted to timing, UK ethics approval delaying data collection until inter-semester break. Postgraduates were included in the sample, given their contribution to the economy and relative lack of focus on their employability (Artess et al., 2014). Student character- istics (see Table 1)a ﬃrm the sample ’s representativeness of the greater HE student popu- lation in both settings, meaning a greater proportion of females, most aged less than 30 years, and approximately one- ﬁfth being international students. There were relatively more females at the UK institution, a younger age distribution and more postgraduate students. Procedures Participants completed an online survey
age distribution and more postgraduate students. Procedures Participants completed an online survey between March and August 2018 with separate ethics approval for each university. Diﬀerent approaches to recruiting students were used due to ethics approval constraints. In the UK, the survey link and study details were cir- culated via social media, and internal career forum and intranet pages commonly usedfor advertising student participation in research projects. In Australia, the link and details were distributed to students via social media and announcements on the univer- sity learning management system. To ensure data were gathered from multiple disci-plines, Australian academic coordinators from across the university were requested byemail to disseminate the survey to their students. Measures Students ﬁrst provided detail on their demographic and study characteristics, including their mother and father ’s occupation. These were classi ﬁed into the eight major ANZSCOHIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 1123

occupational groupings and then further collapsed into ﬁve groups, Table 1 presenting the highest occupation for both parents. All items, other than background characteristics and participation in activities for employability, used ﬁve-point Likert scales. For RQ 1, students rated how actively they participated in seven di ﬀerent co-curricular and extra-curricular employability-related activities. For RQ 2, they provided information on (a) for-credit and (b) co-curricular and extra-curricular work experience (includingpaid work) using closed questions (yes/no/mix) to gather detail on relevance tostudies, pay, length, and whether it was community-focused (e.g., service-learning). ‘Mix’ refers to undertaking some work experience that was part of the curriculum and some that was not. For RQ 3, students indicated their agreement on the importance of work experience (extra-curricular and for-credit) for ﬁve dimensions of employability: insight into the world-of-work, con ﬁdence in undertaking future roles, network contacts, professional proﬁle and motivation and goal-setting for future employment. These dimensions were chosen to re ﬂect contemporary notions of employability (e.g., Jackson, 2016; Tom- linson, 2017), highlighting con ﬁdence, career learning, professional identity development and networks. For RQ 4, students rated the relative importance of di ﬀerent university- based activities for helping to learn about their future careers. Employability-relatedactivities explored in the study were informed by the relevant literature, particularly Kinash et al. ( 2016) and Smith et al. ( 2018). To gauge students ’development of pro- fessional networks, RQ 5, they rated their agreement with ‘I have good contacts with rel- evant people in my targeted career ’. This measure was adapted from Bridgstock’ s(2016) work on social connectedness. The survey instrument was piloted among a selection ofcurrent students to ensure clarity of meaning.

a selection ofcurrent students to ensure clarity of meaning. Analysis Five-point Likert scales measured students ’agreement with the importance of work experience for dimensions of employability (1-strongly disagree, 2-disagree, 3-neither agree/disagree, 4-agree, 5-strongly agree); the perceived importance of university- based activities (for-credit/co-curricular) for learning about future career (1-not impor-tant at all, 2-slightly important, 3-somewhat important, 4-important, 5-very important);and student participation in di ﬀerent employability-related activities. Descriptive tech- niques (means, percentages) were used to analyse data in SPSS 24.0. Multiple linear regressions explored variations in student participation in co-curricu- lar and extra-curricular employability-related activities and evaluated in ﬂuences on pro- fessional network development (students ’contact with relevant people in their targeted career). Regression was appropriate given the sample ’s satisfactory observation-to-vari- able ratio, the absence of collinearity (no in ﬂated standard errors and acceptable variance inﬂation factor and tolerance levels) and auto-correlation (correlation among residuals), and normally distributed data (indicated by kurtosis and skew). Variations in undertaking relevant and paid work experience, for-credit, co-curricular and extra-curricular, were examined using non-parametric tests, given their yes/no/mixresponse formats and exploration of distribution di ﬀerences (Fagerland, 2012). Mann– Whitney U tests compared two independent groups and Kruskal– Wallis tests were used to compare three or more. A Bonferroni correction was applied to both analyses ( α= .007).HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 1125
MANOVA, with an applied Bonferroni correction ( α= .007), analysed variations for the perceived importance of di ﬀerent university-based activities for learning about future career by students ’background and study characteristics. This was selected given the multiple dependent variables, i.e., di ﬀerent aspects of employability. Tukey post-hoc analysis identi ﬁed diﬀerences among multiple groups (e.g., stage of study) and indepen- dent samples t-tests highlighted variations in groups with two categories (e.g., residency). Findings Given the use of self-reported measures, the Harman ’s single factor test (Podsako ﬀet al., 2003) was conducted to gauge common method variance. A four-factor solution emerged, accounting for 61.99% of variance. The one-factor solution accounted for 28.08% of variance, suggesting common method bias was not a concern. RQ1: Participation in co- and extra-curricular activities Figure 1 summarises student participation in a range of co-/extra-curricular activities considered to enhance student employability. Surprisingly, between 40% and 60% ‘never ’or‘rarely ’participated in the di ﬀerent activities. Volunteering and career- related events were undertaken the most and sport groups/clubs the least. The averagerating across all seven activities was 2.59 (between ‘rarely ’and ‘sometimes ’) and 14% of the sample reported undertaking no activities either ‘sometimes ’,‘often ’or‘very often ’. Several background and study characteristics were regressed onto a composite average for participation in extra- and co-curricular activities. Dummy variables were created, base variables denoted by an asterisk in Table 1. Institution was included as a predictor variable to highlight any inﬂ uence particular to that university. Students’ employment status was recoded into ‘employed ’or‘not employed ’. With parental occupation considered a reason- able proxy for socio-economic status (Lien et al., 2001),‘Manager/Professional ’within the highest parental
for socio-economic status (Lien et al., 2001),‘Manager/Professional ’within the highest parental occupation was coded as one and all other groupings as zero. Regression results are summarised in Table 2. Although the adjusted R 2of .08 indi- cated only reasonable ﬁt, the model was signi ﬁcant, F(13, 315) = 3.145, p< .000. Regression coe ﬃcients ( β) indicate the expected unit change in participation in co-cur- ricular and extra-curricular activities for a unit change in the relevant explanatory vari- able. Findings indicate that, apart from the ﬁnal year postgraduates, the more students Figure 1. Participation in co-/extra-curricular activities ( N= 352).1126 D. JACKSON AND M. TOMLINSON
have progressed in their studies, the greater their participation in activities. While inde- pendent samples t-test ( α= .05) revealed no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences in participation in individual activities in the two universities, regression analysis indicated signi ﬁcantly greater participation overall among UK students. RQ2: Participation in work experience Table 3 shows that almost one-half of the samples undertook for-credit work experience that was related to their future career, and just under one-third participated in service- learning. Most for-credit work experience was unpaid and approximately one-half had completed 100 h and the other half had not. A slightly greater proportion had undertaken their experience over more than one academic semester, re ﬂective of curriculum arrange- ments. For extra-curricular work experience completed during university years, just less than one-half was relevant to the students ’future career, half was paid and almost two- thirds was greater than 100 h. Non-parametric results indicated signi ﬁcant variations for student participation in for-credit and extra-curricular work experience for certain study and backgroundcharacteristics (see Table 4). Cross-tabulations indicated a greater proportion in the later stages of study had participated in more than 100 h of extra-curricular and for- credit work experience, the latter over multiple semesters. This is expected, given media and stakeholder focus on the importance of gaining work experience duringTable 2. Inﬂuence on participation in extra-/co-curricular activities.

one’s studies. Interestingly, the positive association for for-credit work experience and stage of study only applied to undergraduates. Cross-tabulations also indicated that over three-quarters of Health/Social Care stu- dents had participated in relevant work experience compared with all other disciplines at approximately 40%. Given the mandatory interwoven practicum experiences inHealth/Social Care, due largely to accreditation requirements, a far greater proportion (68.1%) had completed for-credit work experience over multiple semesters. The lowest proportion was recorded for Arts/Humanities students (24.5%), indicating fewer oppor-tunities for practical experience, often aggravated by the application of degree average entry criterion into elective WIL in generalist degrees. Similarly, just over one-half of Health/Social Care students participated in for-credit service-learning, while Arts/Humanities, Social Sciences and STEM reported 32.6%, 22.8% and 23.8%, respectively. Interestingly, in Australia only, proportionately more international students under- took for-credit work experience that exceeded 100 h than domestic students. A signi ﬁ- cantly greater proportion of employed students understandably reported extra-curricular work experience of more than 100 h although there was no signi ﬁcant di ﬀer- ence for relevant for-credit work experience compared with those not working. This issupported by less than one-quarter of the students reporting they were working inroles related to their targeted career (see Table 1). There were institutional di ﬀerences for for-credit work experience, with more UK students reporting experiences longerthan 100 h and being over multiple semesters.

RQ4: Importance of activities for career learning Table 6 summarises students ’mean ratings for the importance of di ﬀerent university-based activities for helping students to learn about their future career. Di ﬀering perceptions of importance between work experience that is related to one ’s course, and that which is unre- lated, were apparent. Indeed, 77.5% of students felt related work experience was either ‘important ’or‘very important ’compared with only 28.8% for unrelated experience. As one might expect, other activities perceived as most e ﬀective were events conducted by career advisors, although the importance of industry practitioners in mentoring, network- ing and projects was also evident. The second lowest reported mean, following unrelated work experience, was service-learning, perhaps given its focus on civic responsibilityrather than learning about future career. T-tests ( α= .05) indicated signi ﬁcantly higher mean scores for Australian students for industry mentoring ( p= .000), guest lectures (p= .008), related work experience ( p= .000), industry-based projects ( p= .000), pro- fessional networking event ( p= .017) and career services event ( p= .015). MANOVAs (α = .007) were conducted to detect varia tions in the perceived importance of diﬀerent university-based activities for learning about future career. A signi ﬁcant MANOVA was recorded for age, F(27, 949.810) = 2.345, p< .001; λ= .828, partial η 2=. 0 6 .T u k e yp o s t - hoc analysis showed that more mature students as signed relatively less importance to unre- lated work experience. A signi ﬁcant MANOVA for residency, F(9, 327) = 6.230, p< .001; λ = .854, partial η2= .15, was further explored and t-tests indicated that international students placed more importance on all university-based activities than domestic students. A
students placed more importance on all university-based activities than domestic students. A signi ﬁ- cant MANOVA for stage of study, F(36, 1200.925) = 2.034, p< .001; λ= .801, partial η2 = .06, unsurprisingly revealed that later-stage p ostgraduates assigned greater importance to research projects than undergraduates ( p= .003). Finally, early-stage postgraduates con- sidered unrelated work experience mo re important than undergraduates ( p= .001). Interest- ingly, a signi ﬁcant MANOVA was not reported for socio-economic status.

for the di ﬀerent activities, participations classed as ‘sometimes ’,‘often ’and ‘very often ’ were coded to 1 and ‘never ’and ‘rarely ’to 0. For work experience, ‘yes’and ‘mixed ’ were coded to 1 and ‘no’to 0. The model was signi ﬁcant, F(22, 306) = 4.758, p< .000, and the adjusted R2of .201 indicated reasonably good model ﬁt. Results indicated that participating in for-credit, relevant work experience positively predicted students ’rating of good contacts with relevant people in their targeted career. Interestingly, relevant extra-curricular work experience reported a greater posi- tive e ﬀect than for-credit. Also inﬂ uential was participating in relevant professional associations and community groups/clubs. For background and study characteristics, Social Science students had superior contacts compared with Arts/Humanities although this could be sample-speci ﬁc. Mature students felt they had better developed networks for career purposes, while later-stage postgraduates rated their contact networks as sig- niﬁcantly weaker than early-stage undergraduates. Discussion and implications Participation in activities The relatively low uptake in ECAs aligns with other studies (e.g., Thompson et al., 2013), possibly explained by students considering them as social activities and not connecting them with employability and future career (Clark et al., 2015). Advising students of their potential bene ﬁts may be worthwhile, particularly for networking, while being mindful of documented challenges with successfully balancing ECA commitmentsTable 7.

with study (Winstone et al., 2020). Educating students on the role of awards, credential- ing and ePortfolios in evidencing participation and their contribution to employability may also be helpful (Miller et al., 2020), as well as familiarising them with their varied use in recruitment processes across disciplines. While participation in career-related events was relatively high, results still indi- cated that 40% ‘never ’or‘rarely ’participated, disappointing yet cognisant with other studies detecting apathy in students ’utilisation of career services (Bradley et al., 2019). This reinforces the need to, ﬁrst, better engage HE students with career services and more e ﬀectively harness the expertise of career advisors for enhan- cing employability and, second, advance discussions on revising current career pro-vision to more systematically embed career development learning into the curriculum. The relative popularity of volunteering aligns with strong perceptions of its value for enhancing employability (Kinash et al., 2016) and highlights the importance of university-based hubs that facilitate student involvement. Sport clearly ﬁgured less in students ’employability narrative although the low participation contrasted with Thompson and colleagues who found this the most popular ECA among UK undergraduates. Greater participation in activities among later-stage undergraduates may re ﬂect their realisation of employers ’preferences for a ‘rounded graduate ’as they become more actively engaged in recruitment processes. Greater overall participation by UK studentsmay be attributed to underlying cohort di ﬀerences, the UK university attracting relatively more school leavers and commanding high academic grades compared with other localuniversities. The absence of a signi ﬁcant e ﬀect for socio-economic status contravenes other studies (Universities Australia, 2019) and suggestions that less advantaged students perceive the degree as enough to secure employment and tend to
that less advantaged students perceive the degree as enough to secure employment and tend to prioritise studies overemployability-related activities (Burke et al., 2020). One might, therefore, conclude that participation was inﬂ uenced by location, UK students more aware of the employability agenda and having to take responsibility for their professional development during uni- versity years (Tomlinson, 2017). That just fewer than one-half of students participated in for-credit, relevant work experience is positive and exceeds reported ﬁgures in Universities Australia ’s(2019) national WIL audit. Strong trends in unpaid WIL, community-focused experiences, and greater participation in ‘professional ’degrees support Universities Australia ’s ﬁndings. The on-going provision of service-learning opportunities appears important, as does the need to facilitate more opportunities in generalist degrees. Findingsconﬁrmed that WIL typically features towards the end of the degree, prompting review given that graduate employers seek talent far earlier. Australian international students ’relatively high participation in for-credit work experience that exceeds 100 h may re ﬂect their strong motivation to participate in work- place-based WIL (IEAA, 2012) or otherwise their enrolment into degrees designed with lengthier episodes of WIL. Given recent evidence of equitable participation among dom- estic and international students (Universities Australia, 2019), one might tentatively con- clude that barriers to international students engaging in WIL are improving, calling for further investigation. Greater UK student participation in for-credit, lengthier episodes of WIL could re ﬂect the UK’ s provision of sandwich degree programmes (Brooks & Youngson, 2016).HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 1131
Importance of activities for enhancing employability Findings a ﬃrm the importance of relevant WIL for helping students to learn about their future career and broadening their networks, questioning the value of generic pro- grammes in non-disciplinary contexts. The greater importance of unrelated work experi-ence among younger students is expected given they are less likely to have accrued any experience to date. The powerful impact of work experience for developing student con ﬁ- dence and their personal pro ﬁles (particularly among UK students), providing insights into work realities, and informing career planning echo extant literature (Smith et al.,2009). Growing evidence of its positive impact on graduate employment (e.g., McCarthy & Swayn, 2019) further strengthens its role in enhancing employability. Findings reiterate the importance of career advisors, supporting Kinash et al. ( 2016) who asserted their role in designing and delivering for-credit career-related activities.Also apparent is the need to involve industry professionals in co-facilitating projects, mentoring and networking activities for developing students ’career awareness and enabling goal-setting. This upholds on-going calls for collaborative support from indus- try in preparing our students for future work. International students ’stronger motivation in seeking opportunities to enhance their employability is evidenced in other studies (e.g., Pham et al., 2019). Greater appreciation among Australian students of certain university-based activities, coupled with their rela- tively low participation in ECAs, may re ﬂect how equity groups need to carefully balance activities with existing commitments. This highlights the role of universities to think hol-istically about aligning co-curricular, extra-curricular and for-credit activities to their cohort ’s needs and preferences. The shift to embedding employability interventions is strongly supported (e.g., Andrewartha & Harvey, 2017), enabling all
employability interventions is strongly supported (e.g., Andrewartha & Harvey, 2017), enabling all to participate. Con- nected to sustaining and growing o ﬀerings is the need to provide mechanisms by which students can document, re ﬂect on, and articulate their participation and the value gained from these experiences. The study reiterates the beneﬁ ts of relevant work experience for building career con- tacts, emphasising the role of universities to create WIL opportunities that enable network development, providing better access to hidden job markets (Bridgstock,2016). The importance of professional associations and community groups/clubs for net- working accentuates the need to encourage students into these activities through learningand assessment or award programmes, without disadvantaging equity groups (e.g.,virtual engagement for regional students). That more mature students felt they hadbetter developed contact networks is expected given the positive association with time. Later-stage postgraduates rating their contact networks as signi ﬁcantly lower than early-stage undergraduates suggests universities should be more proactively developing awareness of the role of networks and encouraging students to engage with professionals as part of postgraduate programmes. Conclusion This study contributes to the literature by developing our understanding of how students engage with ECAs and di ﬀerent forms of work-related experience to enhance their career readiness. First is the perceived relevance and salience of ECAs to better enhance their1132 D. JACKSON AND M. TOMLINSON
proﬁle through signalling broader sets of dispositions and skills to prospective employers. Furthermore, greater importance is ascribed to activities perceived to be more aligned to anticipated employer demands and which have more prominent job market signallingvalue. Targeted and structured work-related experience not only provides insights andconﬁdence in future employment, serving as a mode of pre-professional socialisation and emerging identity enhancement, but also helps to build career con ﬁdence and goal mapping when transitioning from HE to employment. The study con ﬁrms their sig- niﬁcance for student equity groups for enhancing their career eﬃ cacy and capitals. We conclude, overall, that work-related experiences, especially structured and relevantones, are a crucial bridge between formal study and future employment. They raise stu-dents ’labour market con ﬁdence, perceived employability and provide career-related resources that better equip students for shifting labour market demands. The study provides some valuable insights for those designing and implementing co- curricular and for-credit activities to enhance employability, including the need for diverse o ﬀerings which appeal to di ﬀerent student groups at all stages of study, alongside the value of career and industry practitioner involvement. Regarding study limitations, it reviewed only the activities themselves, and not their design, how they were embedded orevaluated. It relies on self-reported data, which can be biased (Taylor, 2014), and uses a relatively blunt measure for socio-economic status. As surveys do not allow for clari ﬁca- tion, it is possible that students may have interpreted the activities di ﬀerently. Students, particularly undergraduates in early stages of study, may not yet know their career inten- tions or the importance of employability-related activities, potentially skewing responses. Finally, investigation of di ﬀerences by institution-type (e.g., research-intensive
responses. Finally, investigation of di ﬀerences by institution-type (e.g., research-intensive versus vocationally focused) and degree-type (occupational-speci ﬁc versus generalist) may allow greater generalisation of ﬁndings. Future qualitative research could more closely explore how di ﬀerent activities meet varying employers ’recruitment demands and lever- age early positive employment outcomes among student groups. Investigating anyopportunity cost on discipline learning from embedding employability-focused activities, and how they should relate to discipline context, may inform future design. Moreover, longitudinal analysis would help unpack di ﬀerent activities’ longer-term impacts on graduates ’job performance and wider organisational value.

The relative importance of work experience, extra-curricular and university-based activities on student employability Denise Jacksonaand Michael Tomlinsonb aSchool of Business and Law, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia;bEducation, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK ABSTRACT Declining graduate labour markets, perceived devaluing of degree qualiﬁcations, and intense focus on graduate employment metrics have increased pressure on universities to enhance their students ’ employability. Formal curricula developments have beenaccompanied by co-curricular and extra-curricular o ﬀerings intended to enhance students ’career readiness and emerging graduate pro ﬁles. Using survey data from undergraduate and postgraduate students in an Australian and UK university ( N= 352), multivariate techniques examined participation inemployability-related activities and students ’perceptions of their importance for their employability. Data revealed di ﬀerential participation based on student pro ﬁle characteristics and the type of activity undertaken. Overall, these were valued for boosting a range of employability-related facets, including networks, learning about future career and pro ﬁle attractiveness to employers. The more aligned these activities were to intended career outcomes, the more importance they were ascribed. The implications of these ﬁndings for enhancing employability-related oﬀerings in universities are discussed.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 6 November 2019 Accepted 7 February 2021 KEYWORDS Employability; extra-curricular; work experience; work-integrated learning; co- curricular Universities are under pressure to develop student employability, driven by rising enrol- ments and increasing attention to the economic return of completing a degree (Sin et al., 2019). As such, they are expected to produce graduates with future-oriented capabilities that align with rapid changes in globalisation and digitalisation (Cawood et al., 2018). Despite the on-going debate
changes in globalisation and digitalisation (Cawood et al., 2018). Despite the on-going debate on whether graduate employability should play a key rolein shaping higher education (HE) policy and practice (see Smith et al., 2018), the prolifer- ation of employability-focused activities continues to grow (Bennett, 2019) and there remains a strong interest in their enhancement of student employability. The designand type of adopted activities may be de ﬁned by institutions ’strategic focus on employ- ability, such as achieving short-term employment outcomes, enhancing professional readiness and encouraging lifelong learning (Bridgstock & Jackson, 2019). This article focuses on the relative importance of activities designed to augment employability during university years. It recognises the complexity of employability(Jackson, 2016) and engages with a broader suite of employability outcomes beyond © 2021 HERDSACONTACT Denise Jackson d.jackson@ecu.edu.auHIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 2022, VOL. 41, NO. 4, 1119 –1135 https://doi.org/10.1080/07294360.2021.1901663
employment metrics (Jackson & Bridgstock, 2018), including building networks, gaining insight into the world-of-work, con ﬁdence in undertaking future roles, developing a pro- fessional pro ﬁle, motivation and goal-setting for future employment, and learning about future careers. Notably, the student perspective underpins our study, helping us to under- stand which activities aid in ‘gaining and sustaining work ’(Higdon, 2016, p. 176), to inform the e ﬀective development of employability (Andrewartha & Harvey, 2017). Despite considerable literature on tools, resources and approaches to developing student employability through curriculum-based, co-curricular or extra-curricular prac- tices, there remains limited empirical exploration of how they enhance employability, particularly from the student perspective (Tymon, 2013). This is surprising, given employability strategies attract performance indicators (Smith et al., 2018) and graduate employability outcomes are used to compare universities ’performance. Evaluating the perceived importance of employability-related activities may aid institutions’ prioritisa- tion of resources and support, important given crowded curricula (Smith et al., 2018) and time-poor students often being unable to engage in multiple employability-related activi-ties (Tomlinson, 2017). This is particularly problematic for equity groups whose engage- ment in co-curricular and extra-curricular employability activities can be limited bycaring and/or paid work commitments (Future Track, 2013). Our study, therefore, aims to evaluate student participation in employability-related activities and explore the perceived importance of work experience, and curriculum-based, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities for enhancing di ﬀerent dimensions of employability among student groups. Our article ﬁrst reviews the literature on employability-related activities, followed by the presentation of methodology, ﬁndings, and their implications for key
activities, followed by the presentation of methodology, ﬁndings, and their implications for key stakeholders. Activities for enhancing employability There has been much work on activities intended to develop student employability (e.g.,Higher Education Academy, 2012; Kinash et al., 2016), arising from perceived skill mis- matches and pressures on universities to demonstrate employability. These may bebroadly divided into extra-curricular (o ﬀerings beyond degree requirements and not delivered via university systems and processes), co-curricular (not formally part of stu-dents ’studies but administered by universities), and curriculum-based (formally embedded into studies as part of degree o ﬀerings, herein referred to as for-credit). Importantly, these categories ’boundaries can be blurred, particularly where university staﬀmay initiate extra-curricular activities [ECAs] (Clegg et al., 2010). Examples of for-credit activities include student exchanges, study tours, capstone initiatives, debates, competitions, skill programmes, and work-integrated learning(WIL). WIL has received signi ﬁcant attention as a pathway for enhancing student employability. It integrates industry and community engagement into student learningand assessment as part of degree studies (Jackson, 2018), and can be workplace-based (internships/practicums/placements) or virtual/campus-based (industry-based projects/ consultancies/simulations/research projects). It has proved bene ﬁcial for career develop- ment learning, perceived employability and network building (Smith et al., 2009). Also important is service-learning, where students undertake community-focused work to enhance professional capability and social responsibility (Palmer et al., 2010).1120 D. JACKSON AND M. TOMLINSON
Co-curricular o ﬀerings often emulate embedded activities, such as peer/industry men- toring, professional networking activities, and leadership programmes. Other examples include career-related workshops, networking events, seminars co-delivered with indus-try bodies and volunteering programmes. ECAs span engaging with clubs/communitiesand professional associations, and participating in career-related events, volunteering, and paid work. Students are increasingly aware of the competition for graduate roles and the need for positional advantage yet prioritising the most bene ﬁcial activities can be unclear (Thompson et al., 2013). Some universities manage this with structured award programmes that use ePortfolios, micro-credentials, and/or digital badges toguide students on achieving and evidencing their employability (Miller et al., 2020). Embedding employability activities helps students to make connections between their formal study and future employment yet requires discipline academics that are suitablyskilled and committed to developing di ﬀerent aspects of employability (Smith et al., 2018). Universities may otherwise opt for co-curricular provision that is designed and delivered by those familiar with employers ’expectations and good practice in developing employability. Central provision enables economies of scale and provides opportunitiesfor transdisciplinary learning, important for preparing students for diverse work settings.Evidence shows, however, that co-curricular and extra-curricular activities can disadvan- tage equity students who might beneﬁ t most from such interventions yet experience diﬃculties balancing them with study and other commitments (Thompson et al., 2013). Student participation in activities There are equity concerns for low socio-economic status students who already lack cul- tural and social capital and are less able to participate in ECAs due to limited networks and resource constraints (Bathmaker et al., 2016). ECA participation
ECAs due to limited networks and resource constraints (Bathmaker et al., 2016). ECA participation can also vary by dis- cipline, age and gender (Clark et al., 2015). Caring commitments reduce females ’overall participation (Stevenson & Clegg, 2011) and they undertake more paid work than males who tend to engage in sport (Clark et al., 2015). We, therefore, posed: RQ 1: How does student participation in ECAs vary with study and background characteristics? Evidence suggests student engagement in work experience, whether co-curricular, extra-curricular or for-credit (WIL), varies by study and background characteristics. Univer- sities Australia ( 2019), for example, found more Health/Education students participated compared with those from Commerce/Society/Culture, most likely due to course accred- itation requirements. While approximately one-half of students aged between 20 and 29 years participated in WIL, this was signi ﬁcantly lower for older groups. Those similar proportions of domestic and international students undertook WIL contravened earlier evidence of employers ’favouring domestic students, limiting international student access to internships (e.g., International Education Association of Australia [IEAA], 2012). Extra-curricular, unpaid internships are more prevalent in Law/Creative Arts (Interns Australia, 2015) and greater participation in paid work is reported for dom- estic students, females, those in later years of study, and students enrolled in ‘pro- fessional’ degrees, rather than generalist programmes such as Commerce/Humanities. To explore these variances, we asked:HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 1121
RQ 2: How does student participation in work experience vary with study and background characteristics? Gauging importance for employability When gauging the relative importance of employability-related activities, we chose not to explore academic performance, employment outcomes or professional capability devel-opment given extensive literature in these areas (Buckley & Lee, 2018). We instead eval- uated the activities’ relative importance for processual elements of employability (Smith et al., 2018) which impact education-to-work transition and achieving career goals. Holmes ( 2013) also supported refocusing our attention on employability outcomes beyond skills, capabilities and employment to processual aspects to ‘provide a basis for curriculum intervention ’(p. 551). More substantially, we drew on recent conceptualisations of employability (Bridgstock, 2016; Clarke, 2018; Jackson, 2016; Tomlinson, 2017) which highlight key dimensions of professional socialisation, networks, con ﬁdence in capabilities and perceived employabil- ity. Furthermore, recognising the intersection of employability and career development(Healy et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2009), we drew on the DOTS model of career development learning (Watts, 1977). This comprises four elements: decision-making, opportunity awareness, transition learning and self-awareness, and is proved to be relevant for HE stu-dents (Smith et al., 2009). The model emphasises the value of students understanding their strengths, interests and career preferences; proactively engaging in career planning; under- standing career and work opportunities; and e ﬀectively presenting themselves to prospec- tive employers. The perceived importance of activities was thus explored in terms of how well they enable students to expand their networks, gain insight into the world-of-work, be conﬁdent in undertaking future roles, develop a professional pro ﬁle, feel motivated and set goals for future employment, and learn about future
a professional pro ﬁle, feel motivated and set goals for future employment, and learn about future careers. Several studies have reported the positive beneﬁ ts of work experience, particularly when related to one ’s studies, on networking capabilities, building contacts for career purposes, resume building, improved goal-setting, and informed career decision- making from insight into available career pathways (see Bourner & Millican, 2011). In negotiating access to occupational ﬁelds, students with extensive work-related experience may have a ﬁrmer knowledge base of formal and informal labour markets, including opportunities and demands and how to adapt their pro ﬁles accordingly. This can enhance students ’emerging professional pro ﬁle, enabling them to di ﬀerentiate from other suitably quali ﬁed individuals. This led to: RQ 3: How do students perceive the importance of work experience for enhancing their employability? Kinash et al. ( 2016) reviewed numerous for-credit and co-curricular activities for enhan- cing employability using a multi-stakeholder approach. They reported discrepanciesamong students and employers on which strategies were most useful, with students favouring careers advice, ECAs, networking events, professional associations, and volun- teering. Despite important work on ways to enhance employability, their perceived use-fulness and how this may vary among students lacks empirical analysis. We, therefore,investigated:1122 D. JACKSON AND M. TOMLINSON
RQ 4: How do students perceive the importance of university-based interventions for learn- ing about their future career and does this vary by individual and study characteristics? Activities that build professional networks and bridge relations with signi ﬁcant others, especially those aligned with targeted ﬁelds, are critical for enhancing employability (Bridgstock, 2016). ECAs beyond work experience have proved beneﬁ cial for developing networks and networking capabilities yet may vary across equity groups (Buckley & Lee, 2018; Clark et al., 2015). We, therefore, asked: RQ 5: What activities and background characteristics in ﬂuence student development of pro- fessional networks? Material and methods Participants Three hundred and 52 undergraduate and postgraduate students from a research-inten- sive UK-based university ( N= 110) and a smaller Australian university ( N= 242) took part in the study. The geographical locations were selected given their countries ’ similar drivers for a graduate employability agenda and shared understanding thatemployability is core to HE business (Smith et al., 2018), along with comparable graduate labour markets and HE systems. The potential in ﬂuence of contextual di ﬀerences on ﬁndings should, however, be acknowledged. Diﬀerence in sample sizes was largely attrib- uted to timing, UK ethics approval delaying data collection until inter-semester break. Postgraduates were included in the sample, given their contribution to the economy and relative lack of focus on their employability (Artess et al., 2014). Student character- istics (see Table 1)a ﬃrm the sample ’s representativeness of the greater HE student popu- lation in both settings, meaning a greater proportion of females, most aged less than 30 years, and approximately one- ﬁfth being international students. There were relatively more females at the UK institution, a younger age distribution and more postgraduate students. Procedures Participants completed an online survey
age distribution and more postgraduate students. Procedures Participants completed an online survey between March and August 2018 with separate ethics approval for each university. Diﬀerent approaches to recruiting students were used due to ethics approval constraints. In the UK, the survey link and study details were cir- culated via social media, and internal career forum and intranet pages commonly usedfor advertising student participation in research projects. In Australia, the link and details were distributed to students via social media and announcements on the univer- sity learning management system. To ensure data were gathered from multiple disci-plines, Australian academic coordinators from across the university were requested byemail to disseminate the survey to their students. Measures Students ﬁrst provided detail on their demographic and study characteristics, including their mother and father ’s occupation.

occupational groupings and then further collapsed into ﬁve groups, Table 1 presenting the highest occupation for both parents. All items, other than background characteristics and participation in activities for employability, used ﬁve-point Likert scales. For RQ 1, students rated how actively they participated in seven di ﬀerent co-curricular and extra-curricular employability-related activities. For RQ 2, they provided information on (a) for-credit and (b) co-curricular and extra-curricular work experience (includingpaid work) using closed questions (yes/no/mix) to gather detail on relevance tostudies, pay, length, and whether it was community-focused (e.g., service-learning). ‘Mix’ refers to undertaking some work experience that was part of the curriculum and some that was not. For RQ 3, students indicated their agreement on the importance of work experience (extra-curricular and for-credit) for ﬁve dimensions of employability: insight into the world-of-work, con ﬁdence in undertaking future roles, network contacts, professional proﬁle and motivation and goal-setting for future employment. These dimensions were chosen to re ﬂect contemporary notions of employability (e.g., Jackson, 2016; Tom- linson, 2017), highlighting con ﬁdence, career learning, professional identity development and networks. For RQ 4, students rated the relative importance of di ﬀerent university- based activities for helping to learn about their future careers. Employability-relatedactivities explored in the study were informed by the relevant literature, particularly Kinash et al. ( 2016) and Smith et al. ( 2018). To gauge students ’development of pro- fessional networks, RQ 5, they rated their agreement with ‘I have good contacts with rel- evant people in my targeted career ’. This measure was adapted from Bridgstock’ s(2016) work on social connectedness. The survey instrument was piloted among a selection ofcurrent students to ensure clarity of meaning. Analysis Five-point Likert scales
a selection ofcurrent students to ensure clarity of meaning. Analysis Five-point Likert scales measured students ’agreement with the importance of work experience for dimensions of employability (1-strongly disagree, 2-disagree, 3-neither agree/disagree, 4-agree, 5-strongly agree); the perceived importance of university- based activities (for-credit/co-curricular) for learning about future career (1-not impor-tant at all, 2-slightly important, 3-somewhat important, 4-important, 5-very important);and student participation in di ﬀerent employability-related activities. Descriptive tech- niques (means, percentages) were used to analyse data in SPSS 24.0. Multiple linear regressions explored variations in student participation in co-curricu- lar and extra-curricular employability-related activities and evaluated in ﬂuences on pro- fessional network development (students ’contact with relevant people in their targeted career). Regression was appropriate given the sample ’s satisfactory observation-to-vari- able ratio, the absence of collinearity (no in ﬂated standard errors and acceptable variance inﬂation factor and tolerance levels) and auto-correlation (correlation among residuals), and normally distributed data (indicated by kurtosis and skew). Variations in undertaking relevant and paid work experience, for-credit, co-curricular and extra-curricular, were examined using non-parametric tests, given their yes/no/mixresponse formats and exploration of distribution di ﬀerences (Fagerland, 2012). Mann– Whitney U tests compared two independent groups and Kruskal– Wallis tests were used to compare three or more. A Bonferroni correction was applied to both analyses ( α= .007).HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 1125
MANOVA, with an applied Bonferroni correction ( α= .007), analysed variations for the perceived importance of di ﬀerent university-based activities for learning about future career by students ’background and study characteristics. This was selected given the multiple dependent variables, i.e., di ﬀerent aspects of employability. Tukey post-hoc analysis identi ﬁed diﬀerences among multiple groups (e.g., stage of study) and indepen- dent samples t-tests highlighted variations in groups with two categories (e.g., residency). Findings Given the use of self-reported measures, the Harman ’s single factor test (Podsako ﬀet al., 2003) was conducted to gauge common method variance. A four-factor solution emerged, accounting for 61.99% of variance. The one-factor solution accounted for 28.08% of variance, suggesting common method bias was not a concern. RQ1: Participation in co- and extra-curricular activities Figure 1 summarises student participation in a range of co-/extra-curricular activities considered to enhance student employability. Surprisingly, between 40% and 60% ‘never ’or‘rarely ’participated in the di ﬀerent activities. Volunteering and career- related events were undertaken the most and sport groups/clubs the least. The averagerating across all seven activities was 2.59 (between ‘rarely ’and ‘sometimes ’) and 14% of the sample reported undertaking no activities either ‘sometimes ’,‘often ’or‘very often ’. Several background and study characteristics were regressed onto a composite average for participation in extra- and co-curricular activities. Dummy variables were created, base variables denoted by an asterisk in Table 1. Institution was included as a predictor variable to highlight any inﬂ uence particular to that university. Students’ employment status was recoded into ‘employed ’or‘not employed ’. With parental occupation considered a reason- able proxy for socio-economic status (Lien et al., 2001),‘Manager/Professional ’within the highest parental
for socio-economic status (Lien et al., 2001),‘Manager/Professional ’within the highest parental occupation was coded as one and all other groupings as zero. Regression results are summarised in Table 2. Although the adjusted R 2of .08 indi- cated only reasonable ﬁt, the model was signi ﬁcant, F(13, 315) = 3.145, p< .000. Regression coe ﬃcients ( β) indicate the expected unit change in participation in co-cur- ricular and extra-curricular activities for a unit change in the relevant explanatory vari- able. Findings indicate that, apart from the ﬁnal year postgraduates, the more students Figure 1. Participation in co-/extra-curricular activities ( N= 352).1126 D. JACKSON AND M. TOMLINSON
have progressed in their studies, the greater their participation in activities. While inde- pendent samples t-test ( α= .05) revealed no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences in participation in individual activities in the two universities, regression analysis indicated signi ﬁcantly greater participation overall among UK students. RQ2: Participation in work experience Table 3 shows that almost one-half of the samples undertook for-credit work experience that was related to their future career, and just under one-third participated in service- learning. Most for-credit work experience was unpaid and approximately one-half had completed 100 h and the other half had not. A slightly greater proportion had undertaken their experience over more than one academic semester, re ﬂective of curriculum arrange- ments. For extra-curricular work experience completed during university years, just less than one-half was relevant to the students ’future career, half was paid and almost two- thirds was greater than 100 h. Non-parametric results indicated signi ﬁcant variations for student participation in for-credit and extra-curricular work experience for certain study and backgroundcharacteristics (see Table 4). Cross-tabulations indicated a greater proportion in the later stages of study had participated in more than 100 h of extra-curricular and for- credit work experience, the latter over multiple semesters. This is expected, given media and stakeholder focus on the importance of gaining work experience duringTable 2. Inﬂuence on participation in extra-/co-curricular activities.

Results indicated that participating in for-credit, relevant work experience positively predicted students ’rating of good contacts with relevant people in their targeted career. Interestingly, relevant extra-curricular work experience reported a greater posi- tive e ﬀect than for-credit. Also inﬂ uential was participating in relevant professional associations and community groups/clubs. For background and study characteristics, Social Science students had superior contacts compared with Arts/Humanities although this could be sample-speci ﬁc. Mature students felt they had better developed networks for career purposes, while later-stage postgraduates rated their contact networks as sig- niﬁcantly weaker than early-stage undergraduates. Discussion and implications Participation in activities The relatively low uptake in ECAs aligns with other studies (e.g., Thompson et al., 2013), possibly explained by students considering them as social activities and not connecting them with employability and future career (Clark et al., 2015). Advising students of their potential bene ﬁts may be worthwhile, particularly for networking, while being mindful of documented challenges with successfully balancing ECA commitmentsTable 7.

one’s studies. Interestingly, the positive association for for-credit work experience and stage of study only applied to undergraduates. Cross-tabulations also indicated that over three-quarters of Health/Social Care stu- dents had participated in relevant work experience compared with all other disciplines at approximately 40%. Given the mandatory interwoven practicum experiences inHealth/Social Care, due largely to accreditation requirements, a far greater proportion (68.1%) had completed for-credit work experience over multiple semesters. The lowest proportion was recorded for Arts/Humanities students (24.5%), indicating fewer oppor-tunities for practical experience, often aggravated by the application of degree average entry criterion into elective WIL in generalist degrees. Similarly, just over one-half of Health/Social Care students participated in for-credit service-learning, while Arts/Humanities, Social Sciences and STEM reported 32.6%, 22.8% and 23.8%, respectively. Interestingly, in Australia only, proportionately more international students under- took for-credit work experience that exceeded 100 h than domestic students. A signi ﬁ- cantly greater proportion of employed students understandably reported extra-curricular work experience of more than 100 h although there was no signi ﬁcant di ﬀer- ence for relevant for-credit work experience compared with those not working. This issupported by less than one-quarter of the students reporting they were working inroles related to their targeted career (see Table 1). There were institutional di ﬀerences for for-credit work experience, with more UK students reporting experiences longerthan 100 h and being over multiple semesters.

Indeed, 77.5% of students felt related work experience was either ‘important ’or‘very important ’compared with only 28.8% for unrelated experience. As one might expect, other activities perceived as most e ﬀective were events conducted by career advisors, although the importance of industry practitioners in mentoring, network- ing and projects was also evident. The second lowest reported mean, following unrelated work experience, was service-learning, perhaps given its focus on civic responsibilityrather than learning about future career. T-tests ( α= .05) indicated signi ﬁcantly higher mean scores for Australian students for industry mentoring ( p= .000), guest lectures (p= .008), related work experience ( p= .000), industry-based projects ( p= .000), pro- fessional networking event ( p= .017) and career services event ( p= .015). MANOVAs (α = .007) were conducted to detect varia tions in the perceived importance of diﬀerent university-based activities for learning about future career. A signi ﬁcant MANOVA was recorded for age, F(27, 949.810) = 2.345, p< .001; λ= .828, partial η 2=. 0 6 .T u k e yp o s t - hoc analysis showed that more mature students as signed relatively less importance to unre- lated work experience. A signi ﬁcant MANOVA for residency, F(9, 327) = 6.230, p< .001; λ = .854, partial η2= .15, was further explored and t-tests indicated that international students placed more importance on all university-based activities than domestic students. A --- students placed more importance on all university-based activities than domestic students. A signi ﬁ- cant MANOVA for stage of study, F(36, 1200.925) = 2.034, p< .001; λ= .801, partial η2 = .06, unsurprisingly revealed that later-stage p ostgraduates assigned greater importance to research projects than undergraduates ( p= .003). Finally, early-stage postgraduates con- sidered unrelated work experience mo re important than undergraduates ( p= .001). Interest- ingly, a signi ﬁcant MANOVA was not reported for socio-economic status.

with study (Winstone et al., 2020). Educating students on the role of awards, credential- ing and ePortfolios in evidencing participation and their contribution to employability may also be helpful (Miller et al., 2020), as well as familiarising them with their varied use in recruitment processes across disciplines. While participation in career-related events was relatively high, results still indi- cated that 40% ‘never ’or‘rarely ’participated, disappointing yet cognisant with other studies detecting apathy in students ’utilisation of career services (Bradley et al., 2019). This reinforces the need to, ﬁrst, better engage HE students with career services and more e ﬀectively harness the expertise of career advisors for enhan- cing employability and, second, advance discussions on revising current career pro-vision to more systematically embed career development learning into the curriculum. The relative popularity of volunteering aligns with strong perceptions of its value for enhancing employability (Kinash et al., 2016) and highlights the importance of university-based hubs that facilitate student involvement. Sport clearly ﬁgured less in students ’employability narrative although the low participation contrasted with Thompson and colleagues who found this the most popular ECA among UK undergraduates. Greater participation in activities among later-stage undergraduates may re ﬂect their realisation of employers ’preferences for a ‘rounded graduate ’as they become more actively engaged in recruitment processes. Greater overall participation by UK studentsmay be attributed to underlying cohort di ﬀerences, the UK university attracting relatively more school leavers and commanding high academic grades compared with other localuniversities. The absence of a signi ﬁcant e ﬀect for socio-economic status contravenes other studies (Universities Australia, 2019) and suggestions that less advantaged students perceive the degree as enough to secure employment and tend to
that less advantaged students perceive the degree as enough to secure employment and tend to prioritise studies overemployability-related activities (Burke et al., 2020). One might, therefore, conclude that participation was inﬂ uenced by location, UK students more aware of the employability agenda and having to take responsibility for their professional development during uni- versity years (Tomlinson, 2017). That just fewer than one-half of students participated in for-credit, relevant work experience is positive and exceeds reported ﬁgures in Universities Australia ’s(2019) national WIL audit. Strong trends in unpaid WIL, community-focused experiences, and greater participation in ‘professional ’degrees support Universities Australia ’s ﬁndings. The on-going provision of service-learning opportunities appears important, as does the need to facilitate more opportunities in generalist degrees. Findingsconﬁrmed that WIL typically features towards the end of the degree, prompting review given that graduate employers seek talent far earlier. Australian international students ’relatively high participation in for-credit work experience that exceeds 100 h may re ﬂect their strong motivation to participate in work- place-based WIL (IEAA, 2012) or otherwise their enrolment into degrees designed with lengthier episodes of WIL. Given recent evidence of equitable participation among dom- estic and international students (Universities Australia, 2019), one might tentatively con- clude that barriers to international students engaging in WIL are improving, calling for further investigation. Greater UK student participation in for-credit, lengthier episodes of WIL could re ﬂect the UK’ s provision of sandwich degree programmes (Brooks & Youngson, 2016).HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 1131
Importance of activities for enhancing employability Findings a ﬃrm the importance of relevant WIL for helping students to learn about their future career and broadening their networks, questioning the value of generic pro- grammes in non-disciplinary contexts. The greater importance of unrelated work experi-ence among younger students is expected given they are less likely to have accrued any experience to date. The powerful impact of work experience for developing student con ﬁ- dence and their personal pro ﬁles (particularly among UK students), providing insights into work realities, and informing career planning echo extant literature (Smith et al.,2009). Growing evidence of its positive impact on graduate employment (e.g., McCarthy & Swayn, 2019) further strengthens its role in enhancing employability. Findings reiterate the importance of career advisors, supporting Kinash et al. ( 2016) who asserted their role in designing and delivering for-credit career-related activities.Also apparent is the need to involve industry professionals in co-facilitating projects, mentoring and networking activities for developing students ’career awareness and enabling goal-setting. This upholds on-going calls for collaborative support from indus- try in preparing our students for future work. International students ’stronger motivation in seeking opportunities to enhance their employability is evidenced in other studies (e.g., Pham et al., 2019). Greater appreciation among Australian students of certain university-based activities, coupled with their rela- tively low participation in ECAs, may re ﬂect how equity groups need to carefully balance activities with existing commitments. This highlights the role of universities to think hol-istically about aligning co-curricular, extra-curricular and for-credit activities to their cohort ’s needs and preferences. The shift to embedding employability interventions is strongly supported (e.g., Andrewartha & Harvey, 2017), enabling all
employability interventions is strongly supported (e.g., Andrewartha & Harvey, 2017), enabling all to participate. Con- nected to sustaining and growing o ﬀerings is the need to provide mechanisms by which students can document, re ﬂect on, and articulate their participation and the value gained from these experiences. The study reiterates the beneﬁ ts of relevant work experience for building career con- tacts, emphasising the role of universities to create WIL opportunities that enable network development, providing better access to hidden job markets (Bridgstock,2016). The importance of professional associations and community groups/clubs for net- working accentuates the need to encourage students into these activities through learningand assessment or award programmes, without disadvantaging equity groups (e.g.,virtual engagement for regional students). That more mature students felt they hadbetter developed contact networks is expected given the positive association with time. Later-stage postgraduates rating their contact networks as signi ﬁcantly lower than early-stage undergraduates suggests universities should be more proactively developing awareness of the role of networks and encouraging students to engage with professionals as part of postgraduate programmes. Conclusion This study contributes to the literature by developing our understanding of how students engage with ECAs and di ﬀerent forms of work-related experience to enhance their career readiness. First is the perceived relevance and salience of ECAs to better enhance their1132 D. JACKSON AND M. TOMLINSON
proﬁle through signalling broader sets of dispositions and skills to prospective employers. Furthermore, greater importance is ascribed to activities perceived to be more aligned to anticipated employer demands and which have more prominent job market signallingvalue. Targeted and structured work-related experience not only provides insights andconﬁdence in future employment, serving as a mode of pre-professional socialisation and emerging identity enhancement, but also helps to build career con ﬁdence and goal mapping when transitioning from HE to employment. The study con ﬁrms their sig- niﬁcance for student equity groups for enhancing their career eﬃ cacy and capitals. We conclude, overall, that work-related experiences, especially structured and relevantones, are a crucial bridge between formal study and future employment. They raise stu-dents ’labour market con ﬁdence, perceived employability and provide career-related resources that better equip students for shifting labour market demands. The study provides some valuable insights for those designing and implementing co- curricular and for-credit activities to enhance employability, including the need for diverse o ﬀerings which appeal to di ﬀerent student groups at all stages of study, alongside the value of career and industry practitioner involvement. Regarding study limitations, it reviewed only the activities themselves, and not their design, how they were embedded orevaluated. It relies on self-reported data, which can be biased (Taylor, 2014), and uses a relatively blunt measure for socio-economic status. As surveys do not allow for clari ﬁca- tion, it is possible that students may have interpreted the activities di ﬀerently. Students, particularly undergraduates in early stages of study, may not yet know their career inten- tions or the importance of employability-related activities, potentially skewing responses. Finally, investigation of di ﬀerences by institution-type (e.g., research-intensive
responses. Finally, investigation of di ﬀerences by institution-type (e.g., research-intensive versus vocationally focused) and degree-type (occupational-speci ﬁc versus generalist) may allow greater generalisation of ﬁndings. Future qualitative research could more closely explore how di ﬀerent activities meet varying employers ’recruitment demands and lever- age early positive employment outcomes among student groups. Investigating anyopportunity cost on discipline learning from embedding employability-focused activities, and how they should relate to discipline context, may inform future design. Moreover, longitudinal analysis would help unpack di ﬀerent activities’ longer-term impacts on graduates ’job performance and wider organisational value.

### Contexto y Relevancia
El artículo aborda la creciente preocupación por la empleabilidad de los graduados en un mercado laboral competitivo y en declive, donde las cualificaciones académicas son percibidas como menos valiosas. Esto ha llevado a las universidades a implementar no solo currículos formales, sino también actividades co-curriculares y extracurriculares que preparen a los estudiantes para el empleo.

### Metodología
El estudio se basa en encuestas a 352 estudiantes de pregrado y posgrado en universidades de Australia y el Reino Unido. Se utilizaron técnicas multivariadas para analizar la participación de los estudiantes en actividades relacionadas con la empleabilidad y sus percepciones sobre la importancia de estas actividades.

### Resultados
Los hallazgos indican que la participación en actividades extracurriculares y laborales varía según el perfil de los estudiantes y el tipo de actividad. Los estudiantes valoran estas actividades por su capacidad para mejorar la creación de redes profesionales, el aprendizaje sobre carreras futuras y la atracción de empleadores. Se observó que cuanto más alineadas estaban estas actividades con los objetivos profesionales de los estudiantes, mayor era su importancia.

### Implicaciones
El artículo concluye que es crucial que las universidades consideren la relevancia y alineación de las actividades ofrecidas con las aspiraciones profesionales de los estudiantes para maximizar su efectividad en la preparación para el empleo. Se discuten las transformaciones en la globalización y digitalización, y se enfatiza la necesidad de un enfoque más holístico en la evaluación de la empleabilidad.

### Actividades Relacionadas con la Empleabilidad
Se identifican tres categorías principales de actividades:
1. **Actividades Extra-Curriculares (ECA)**: Independientes de los requisitos del grado, a menudo organizadas por estudiantes.
2. **Actividades Co-Curriculares**: Complementan la educación formal y son administradas por las universidades.
3. **Actividades Basadas en el Currículo (For-Credit)**: Integradas en los programas de estudio, como pasantías y proyectos de investigación.

El aprendizaje integrado en el trabajo (WIL) se destaca como un medio eficaz para mejorar la empleabilidad, combinando el compromiso con la industria y la comunidad.

### Desafíos y Consideraciones
El texto también aborda la variabilidad en la participación de estudiantes en actividades relacionadas con la empleabilidad, destacando que los estudiantes de grupos de equidad pueden enfrentar barreras para participar debido a compromisos laborales o de cuidado. Se plantea la necesidad de investigar más a fondo cómo estas actividades afectan la empleabilidad desde la perspectiva del estudiante.

### Preguntas de Investigación
El estudio plantea varias preguntas de investigación sobre la participación de los estudiantes en actividades relacionadas con la empleabilidad y su percepción de la importancia de la experiencia laboral. Se busca entender cómo estas experiencias influyen en la creación de redes profesionales y en la preparación para el empleo.

### Conclusiones
El artículo subraya la importancia de las actividades educativas en la mejora de la empleabilidad de los estudiantes, sugiriendo que las universidades deben implementar estrategias efectivas que integren la teoría con la práctica. Se enfatiza la necesidad de un enfoque más inclusivo y equitativo en la oferta de actividades relacionadas con la empleabilidad, considerando las diversas necesidades y contextos de los estudiantes.

### Referencias
El texto incluye una amplia gama de referencias que abordan la empleabilidad de los graduados, la importancia de las actividades extracurriculares y la relación entre la educación superior y el mercado laboral, proporcionando un marco teórico sólido para el estudio.

En resumen, el artículo de Jackson y Tomlinson ofrece una visión integral sobre cómo las experiencias laborales y las actividades universitarias impactan la empleabilidad de los estudiantes, destacando la necesidad de un enfoque estratégico y holístico en la educación superior para preparar a los graduados para el mercado laboral actual.
