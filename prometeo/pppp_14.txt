Which regions produce the most innovation policy research? Pedro López-Rubioa, Norat Roig-Tiernoaand Alicia Mas-Turb aDepartment of Economics and Social Science, Universitat Politècnica de València, Valencia, Spain; bDepartamento de Dirección de Empresas, Universitat de València, València, Spain ABSTRACT This article uses the data indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus databases up to and including the year 2020 to map leading regions and trending topics in academic innovation policy research. The country analysis highlights fourleading regions in this research ﬁeld: Western Europe (led by the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, and Spain), North America (led bythe USA), Scandinavia (led by Sweden and Denmark), and Asia- Paciﬁc (led by China and Australia). The most common keywords are used to develop a conceptual framework. Applying the Tree of Science approach, we classify the most in ﬂuential studies into three categories: foundational studies (the roots), structuralstudies (the trunk), and recent studies (the leaves). This approach shows that trending topics are built around ﬁve main pillars: innovation systems, policy tools, knowledge management, sustainability, and entrepreneurship. Finally, based on analysis of the most common keywords and the most in ﬂuential studies, we propose a Sextuple Helix model. This model consists of theQuintuple Helix (government, university, industry, knowledge society, and sustainability) with the added dimension ofentrepreneurship. This model o ﬀers an analytical framework with massive potential for academic research on innovation policy inthe current economic context.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 11 June 2019 Accepted 27 May 2021 KEYWORDS Innovation policy; innovation systems; policy tools; knowledge management;sustainability;entrepreneurship; Sextuple Helix; bibliometrics JEL CLASSIFICATION O29; O30; O38; O10; O57 1. Introduction In recent decades, the number of academic studies of innovation research has grown faster
In recent decades, the number of academic studies of innovation research has grown faster than the number of studies in other areas. This growth suggests that scholars from multiple disciplines are expressing an interest in the e ﬀects of innovation activity and the innovation process on the economy (Merigó et al. 2016 ; Cancino, Merigó, and Coronado 2017 ,2020 ). Innovation policies play a leading role in innovation research, emerging as a new ﬁeld of economic policy in the last few decades. The term “innovation policy ”is now com- monly used given the widespread view that policy plays a role in supporting innovation. Innovation policy attempts to in ﬂuence innovation activity, often to boost economic growth (Fagerberg 2017 ). The origins of the term lie in the intellectual environment that developed around the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at the University of © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis GroupCONTACT Pedro López-Rubio pedloru@doctor.upv.es Department of Economics and Social Science, Universitat Politècnica de València, Camino de Vera, s/n, Valencia, SpainPOLICY STUDIES 2022, VOL. 43, NO. 5, 1112 –1134 https://doi.org/10.1080/01442872.2021.1937595
Sussex from the late 1960s onward (Fagerberg et al. 2011 ). SPRU professor Roy Rothwell did much during the 1980s to increase interest in the topic (Rothwell 1982 ). However, the real surge of interest occurred in the 1990s, when national governments and international organizations, such as the OECD, started to focus on innovation policies that supportcompanies ’innovation via di ﬀerent instruments or tools aimed at improving the business environment (OECD 2011 ; European Commission 2018 ). Scholars around the world have also shown an interest in innovation policy. The resulting body of work explores relevant innovation policy issues such as social problems and gender equality (Fagerberg, Laestadius, and Martin 2015 ; Alsos, Hytti, and Ljungg- ren2016 ), as well as policy design, implementation, and evaluation (Flanagan and Uyarra 2016 ; Edler and Fagerberg 2017 ). This body of work also includes reviews of innovation policies in di ﬀerent countries, regions and continents (McCann and Ortega-Argilés 2015 ; Fu, Woo, and Hou 2016 ; Petersen and Kruss 2019 ). Against this backdrop, the objective of this article is to analyze academic innovation policy research using bibliometrics to map the leading regions and topics in this ﬁeld. There have been several recent bibliometric studies of innovation focused on the leading countries, regions and universities (Merigó et al. 2016 ), the most relevant authors (Cancino, Merigó, and Coronado 2017 ), and the most outstanding researchers of the Ibero-American region (Cancino et al. 2020 ), and related topics such as knowledge management (Gaviria-Marin, Merigó, and Baier-Fuentes 2019 ), and technology transfer (López-Rubio et al. 2021a). However, to the best of our knowledge, no bibliometric studies have focused speci ﬁcally on innovation policy research. The bibliometric analysis conducted in this article deals with diverse indicators to present the annual evolution of publications, the leading countries and regions, the most
to present the annual evolution of publications, the leading countries and regions, the most commonly used keywords, and the most in ﬂuential studies in innovation policy research. Furthermore, to visualize the results clearly and accurately, bibliometric mapping is used. The bibliometric mapping of scienti ﬁc research ﬁelds is based on the quantitative analysis of bibliographic data. As policy support tools, bibliometric maps can provide an overview of the structure of a research ﬁeld and can be used to monitor its evolution (Noyons, Moed, and Van Raan 1999 ). This article includes biblio- metric maps of bibliographic coupling between countries to link documents with asimilar research focus, thereby measuring the shared intellectual background among countries. It also provides maps of keyword co-occurrence to produce a conceptual fra-mework of academic innovation policy research. Lastly, the most inﬂ uential studies are analyzed using the Tree of Science approach to investigate the intellectual structure of this research ﬁeld (Robledo Giraldo, Osorio Zuluaga, and López Espinosa 2014 ). This structure is formed by the “roots, ”“trunk,” and “leaves ”. The roots are where the articles that lay the foundations for the ﬁeld of study can be found. The articles in the trunk lend structure to the research ﬁeld. Finally, the leaves correspond to the most recent articles. Thus, the articles in the roots and trunk give a clear overview of the foundations and evolution, whereas the articles in the leaves indicate where this ﬁeld of research is going. The rest of the article is structured as follows. Section 2describes the bibliometric methods and data used in the article. Section 3presents the results of the bibliometric analysis. Section 4summarizes the main ﬁndings.POLICY STUDIES 1113
2. Bibliometric methods and data The research method used in this article is bibliometric analysis. Bibliometrics (Pritchard 1969 ) refers to the study of all quantitative aspects of bibliographic material (Broadus 1987 ). The most commonly used bibliometric indicators include the total number of studies, the total number of citations, and the h-index (Hirsch 2005 ; Gaviria-Marin, Merigó, and Baier-Fuentes 2019 ). The total number of studies is a proxy for productivity, whereas the total number of citations and the h-index are proxies for in ﬂuence and impact. Both types of variables should be considered in a bibliometric analysis. Doingso provides a more accurate and objective measure of scienti ﬁc production. Neither a large number of publications nor a large number of citations necessarily implieshigher research quality. The h-index tries to overcome these drawbacks by accountingfor both the number of studies and the number of citations. However, the h-index hassome limitations. For instance, a researcher with few articles but many citations might have the same h-index as a researcher with many articles, not all of which are highly cited (Egghe 2006 ). This problem can be overcome by calculating other indicators to improve the accuracy of the bibliometric analysis. Such indicators include citations per year and citations per study (Gaviria-Marin, Merigó, and Baier-Fuentes 2019 ). The most common bibliometric mapping approaches are based on bibliographic coupling, co-citations, co-authorship, and keyword co-occurrence. Bibliographic coup-ling measures the shared intellectual background of a set of documents. A strength value is calculated between documents in the sample based on the references sharedby each two documents (Kessler 1963 ). The more shared references there are, the stron- ger the theoretical foundations shared by the two documents are assumed to be. Biblio-graphic coupling makes it possible to link documents with a similar research focus,thereby
Biblio-graphic coupling makes it possible to link documents with a similar research focus,thereby revealing the knowledge structure of a ﬁeld (Jarvening 2007 ). Co-citation analysis identi ﬁes the shared background of publications in a data set. Two documents are co- cited if one or more documents cite both articles (Small 1973 ). The weighting of a co-cita- tion is based on the number of articles that co-cite the two documents. It reveals anetwork of cited documents rather than linking the documents in the data set (Garﬁeld2001 ). Co-authorship identi ﬁes research collaboration networks based on the number of co-authored documents (White and Griﬃ th1981 ). Lastly, keyword co-occur- rence identi ﬁes links among research topics in a particular ﬁeld based on the frequency of co-occurrence of keywords in documents. It also tracks developments in that ﬁeld (Callon et al. 1983 ). 2.1. Data Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and Google Scholar are the most commonly used scien- tiﬁc databases. WoS, currently owned by Clarivate Analytics, is the oldest citation resource. Scopus and Google Scholar were launched in 2004 by Elsevier and Google Inc. respectively. Google Scholar provides a broader range of data sources, including more books, conference papers, and non-US journals (Harzing and Van der Wal 2008 ). WoS is the most restrictive in its coverage of materials. WoS excludes almost all books, and its coverage of social science works is known to be far narrower than itscoverage of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM)1114 P. LÓPEZ-RUBIO ET AL.
sciences, in terms of both the types of literature and the scope of the journals (Van Leeuwen 2006 ; Norris and Oppenheim 2007 ). Adriaanse and Rensleigh ( 2013 ) observed that WoS performed best in terms of total coverage of the journal sample population and retrieved the most unique items. Further- more, their investigation into multiple copies indicated that WoS and Scopus retrieved no duplicates, whereas Google Scholar retrieved multiple copies. Lastly, Scopus delivered the fewest inconsistencies regarding content veri ﬁcation and content quality, whereas Google Scholar retrieved the most inconsistencies. Examples of these inconsistencies included author spelling, author sequence, volume, and issue number. Regarding bibliometric mapping, diverse bibliographic software tools can be used to map the data gathered from WoS and Scopus. Each of these tools has certain advantagesand drawbacks (Cobo et al. 2011 ). In the case of Google Scholar, Publish or Perish soft- ware can retrieve the raw citations and calculate a range of metrics such as total studies and citations, average citations per study, citations per author, studies per author, cita- tions per year, Hirsch ’s h-index, and Egghe ’s g-index (Harzing 2007 ). However, there is no tool to produce bibliometric maps based on Google Scholar data. Accordingly, we chose WoS Core Collection (WoS CC) and Scopus as data sources. These databases made it possible to produce bibliometric maps to address the maingoals of this article. We used VOSviewer for this purpose because it supports all the maps required for this study (Van Eck and Waltman 2010 ). Including both databases partially overcame the poor coverage of the social sciences and non-U.S. journals pro- vided by WoS. We selected only peer-review studies. Speci ﬁcally, we selected only articles and reviews (book reviews were excluded). The peer-review process is generally considered a guaran-tee of quality within academia. The importance of this process has been
considered a guaran-tee of quality within academia. The importance of this process has been evident during the current COVID-19 crises, with the rapid publication of COVID-19 literature throughexpedited review and preprint publications providing important resources for themedical and scienti ﬁc community. However, there are always risks of unveri ﬁed infor- mation and information without solid evidence being used to in ﬂuence policy decisions (Bagsadarian, Cross, and Fisher 2020 ). Finally, we reviewed and analyzed the most in ﬂuential studies using the Tree of Science approach. This approach consists of placing articles into three categories:roots, trunk, and leaves. The roots contain articles that provide a theoretical and concep-tual foundation. The articles that lend structure to the ﬁeld appear in the trunk. Lastly, the leaves are made up of the most recent articles, revealing trends in intellectual devel-opment (Robledo Giraldo, Osorio Zuluaga, and López Espinosa 2014 ). The search performed in the WoS CC and Scopus databases was Topic = “innovation policy ”OR“innovation policies ”OR“policy of innovation ”OR“policies of innovation ”, where the ﬁeldTopic included the publication title, abstract, and keywords. This search was conducted in January 2021 and covered all years up to and including 2020. It returned3,297 documents in WoS CC and 4,104 documents in Scopus. Our analysis included only articles and reviews. Therefore, the results of the search were reduced to 2,537 studies (2,458 articles and 79 reviews) in WoS CC (77% of all innovation policy publicationsindexed in WoS CC) and 3,069 studies (2,909 articles and 160 reviews) in Scopus (75% of all innovation policy publications indexed in Scopus). According to these results, Scopus had approximately 20% more innovation policy studies than WoS CC.POLICY STUDIES 1115
Table 1 shows the top 10 research areas in terms of number of innovation policy studies indexed in WoS CC and Scopus. One study can cover more than one research area. These results corroborate under-representation of social sciences and other disci- plines such as psychology, arts, and humanities in WoS CC. 3. Results This section presents the main bibliometric results for the selected set of innovation policy research documents indexed in WoS CC and Scopus between 1960 and 2020. The search was conducted in January 2021 and identi ﬁed 2,537 studies in WoS CC and 3,069 studies in Scopus up to and including 2020. 3.1. Annual evolution of publications Figure 1 shows the annual total number of academic publications on innovation policy according to data from WoS CC and Scopus. The ﬁrst study in Scopus, “Innovation in indus- try: a discussion of the state-of-art and the results of innovation research in German-speaking countries ”(Uhlmann 1975), was published in 1975. The ﬁrst two studies in WoS CC were published in 1982: “Government innovation policy: some past problems and recent trends ” (Rothwell 1982)a n d “Some aspects of technological innovation policy ”(Drulovic 1982). From 1982 onward, the production of documents indexed in both databases has been steady, with a substantial increase in innovation policy research since 2005. This increase has mainly been driven by three factors. First, research production improved consider- ably with the rapid development of the Internet and computers. These developmentsmade data collection easier and allowed access to the latest trends in this (and indeed vir- tually any) research ﬁeld. Second, there has been a sharp increase in the number of researchers from developing countries. Third, this period witnessed the emergence of knowledge economies (Lundvall 2016 ). 3.2.

aﬃliations at the same time. Therefore, a single author may have publications corre- sponding to two or more countries. In this analysis, country a ﬃliation refers to the country where the author was working at the time the relevant document was published. Table 2 presents the 20 most productive countries in innovation policy research according to the data from WoS CC and Scopus. This table includes the total number of studies (a proxy for absolute productivity), total number of citations (a proxy for absol-ute inﬂ uence), h-index (which represents a combined measure of productivity and inﬂuence), and citations per study (a proxy for e ﬃciency).

indicator. Therefore, the results may be interpreted in di ﬀerent ways depending on the interests of the researchers. Interestingly, both top 20 rankings comprise the same countries, with the exception of Poland (ranked 20th in WoS CC) and South Korea(ranked 20th in Scopus). Of the other 19 countries, nine are in Western Europe (theUK, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Italy, France, Austria, Belgium, and Portugal), two (the USA and Canada) are in North America, four are Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Denmark), and one is in each of Eastern Europe (Russia), Asia(China), Oceania (Australia), and South America (Brazil). Overall (considering both databases and all indicators), the UK leads the academic innovation policy research rankings, followed by the Netherlands, the USA, Germany,Sweden, Spain, and Denmark. Russia, Brazil, and Poland have better results in terms of productivity (total studies) than in terms of in ﬂuence (total citations, h-index, and citations per study). The regional analysis highlights four leading geographical areas in thisﬁeld: Western Europe (led by the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, and Spain), North America (led by the USA), Scandinavia (led by Sweden and Denmark), andAsia-Paci ﬁc (led by China and Australia). The bibliographic coupling of the main countries in innovation policy research based on the authors’ aﬃliation is also of interest. Bibliographic coupling links docu- ments with a similar research focus. It thereby measures the shared intellectual back-ground of di ﬀerent countries. Figures 2 and 3depict the maps of bibliographic coupling between countries for the WoS CC and Scopus databases, respectively. Only the 200 most representative links and countries with at least 20 innovation policy studies were included (32 countries in WoS CC and 38 countries in Scopus).In the VOSviewer network visualization, the size of the label and the circle of an item are determined by its weighting. The colour of an item is determined by
and the circle of an item are determined by its weighting. The colour of an item is determined by the cluster to which it belongs. There are six additional countries or territories in the Scopus bibliographic coupling map compared with the WoS CC map: Kazakhstan (with 31 studies), Hungary (27), Hong Kong and Greece (21 each), and New Zealand and Argentina (20 each). As expected, all of them are peripheral nodes. WoS CC and Scopus Clusters 1 (red) comprisecountries from Europe and Asia, plus the USA, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa. According to the size and position of the circles, the UK, the USA, Russia, and France can be considered the main nodes in WoS CC Cluster 1, and theUSA, Russia, and Canada in Scopus Cluster 1. Russia is the only Eastern European country in WoS CC Cluster 1, while Scopus Cluster 1 contains ﬁve countries from this region (Russia, Poland, Estonia, Ukraine, and Hungary). Surprisingly, despite China has more publications than France or Canada, it occupies a more peripheral position. Clusters 2 (green) exclusively comprise European countries: WoS CC Cluster 2 contains Western and Eastern European countries and is centred on Spain and Italy; ScopusCluster 2 central nodes are the UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Finland, and it containsWestern European and Nordic countries, plus Slovakia and Czech Republic. Lastly, WoS CC Cluster 3 (blue) is centred on Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Finland, and includes Western European and Nordic countries, while Scopus Cluster 3 (blue) isformed by the Netherlands, Switzerland, New Zealand, and Japan. Overall, these results show similar trends, but some di ﬀerences, between WoS CC and Scopus. Such diﬀerences can be explained as a consequence of the broader Scopus coverage of non-1118 P.

U.S. journals and of research developed by authors a ﬃliated to institutions from countries outside the leading regions in academic innovation policy. 3.3. Analysis of the most common keywords in academic innovation policy research This section presents a conceptual framework and describes the cognitive state and evol- ution of academic innovation policy research. According to Callon et al. ( 1983 ), analysis of the co-occurrence of keywords studies the conceptual structure of a research ﬁeld. Figures 4 and5provide a bibliometric mapping of the co-occurrence of the 50 most common keywords in innovation policy research according to the data from WoS CC and Scopus, respectively. The 200 strongest links were represented, and all types of key- words were considered to produce these maps: author keywords, keywords established byWoS CC (KeyWords Plus ), and keywords established by Scopus ( Index Keywords ). The size of the circles associated with each keyword and their centrality gives an idea ofthe prominence of the di ﬀerent concepts within the framework. Besides, the distance between two keywords in the visualization approximately indicates the relatedness of the keywords in terms of co-occurrence links. In general, the closer the two keywords are located to each other, the stronger their relatedness (Van Eck and Waltman 2010 ). To observe how the use of these keywords has evolved, the VOSviewer overlay visualiza-tion and the average publication year variable were used. In this kind of visualization, the Figure 2. Bibliographic coupling of countries according to data from WoS CC.POLICY STUDIES 1119

colour of the item indicates its average publication year. Table 3 presents these keywords, along with the number of occurrences and co-occurrences and the average publication year. The concepts captured by the keywords are diverse. However, most relate to factors and agents that have impact on innovation such as di ﬀerent kind of policies, R&D, tech- nology, knowledge, science, ﬁrms, industry, universities, networks, governance, invest- ment, sustainability, entrepreneurship, and collaboration; the dynamics or outputs of innovation like performance, technological and regional development, economic growth and development, productivity, and competitiveness; and innovation modelsincluding national innovation systems (NIS; Freeman 1987 ; Lundvall 1992 ; Nelson 1993 ), regional innovation systems (RIS; Cooke 1992 ), and the Triple Helix (Etzkowitz and Leydesdor ﬀ2000 ). According to the WoS CC keyword co-occurrence map, there are 10 links of the 200 most representative ones that involve the keyword impact. Such links are between impact and the following keywords: innovation (co-occurrence link strength of 57), innovation policy (co-occurrence link strength of 49), R&D (co-occurrence link strength of 41), per-formance (co-occurrence link strength of 33), technology (co-occurrence link strength of 30), knowledge (co-occurrence link strength of 26), policy and ﬁrms (co-occurrence link strength of 23 each), systems (co-occurrence link strength of 18), and collaboration (co- occurrence link strength of 17). All these keywords are among the 10 most common key- words, except for collaboration. This denotes the relevance of the relationship between impact and collaboration, despite collaboration is the 31st most common keyword inWoS CC. Furthermore, the analysis of the co-occurrence link strengths together withthe distance between keywords shows that the concept impact has a primary degree of Figure 5. Map of keyword co-occurrence according to data from Scopus.POLICY STUDIES

relatedness with innovation, innovation policy, R&D, performance and technology, and a secondary degree with knowledge, policy, ﬁrms, systems and collaboration. Interestingly, smart specialization is the newest keyword in WoS CC and Scopus.

it is a recent research topic. Smart specialization has become central to the development of a reformed economic, social, and regional European cohesion policy. It is based on the principles of smart, green, and inclusive growth. Smart specialization is aimed at achiev-ing a sustainable development model based on individual regional speciﬁ cities (McCann and Ortega-Argilés 2015 ). Therefore, sustainable development is becoming increasingly important within innovation policy research. 3.4. Analysis of the most in ﬂuential studies in academic innovation policy research There are many inﬂ uential articles on innovation policy. One method to identify them is to classify publications based on the number of citations, which re ﬂects the inﬂ uence, popularity, and attention received from the scienti ﬁc community. However, the total number of citations beneﬁ ts older articles because they have longer to accumulate cita- tions. Therefore, we also included the citations per year (López-Rubio, Roig-Tierno, and Mas-Tur 2020 ). In this section, the intellectual structure of innovation policy research is outlined by analyzing the most inﬂ uential articles. To determine the most in ﬂuential articles, we applied two criteria: (1) The 20 most cited studies (2) The 20 studies with the highest number of citations per year. Based on these criteria, there are 28 in ﬂuential studies: 23 of these studies meet the cri- teria in both databases, two studies meet the criteria in WoS but not in Scopus (Etzkowitz and Klofsten 2005 ; Binz and Truffer 2017 ), and three studies meet the criteria in Scopus but are not indexed in WoS CC (Smits and Kuhlmann 2004 ; Doloreux and Parto 2005 ; Ranga and Etzkowitz 2013 ). Applying the Tree of Science approach (Robledo Giraldo, Osorio Zuluaga, and López Espinosa 2014 ) to these data, we produced the Tree of Science for academic innovation policy research. This tree is made up of three categories: the roots, which contain thestudies that provide the
This tree is made up of three categories: the roots, which contain thestudies that provide the theoretical and conceptual foundation; the trunk, which lendsstructure to the ﬁeld; and the leaves, which are the most recent studies that enable identi ﬁcation of trends in intellectual development. Figure 6 shows the studies in the Tree of Science and Table 4 summarizes the analysis of these documents, including their main innovation policy-related topics. According to them, we labelled the research areas addressed by the studies. The studies in the roots are focused on three main research areas that lay the foun- dations for academic innovation policy research (innovation systems, policy tools, andknowledge management) as well as a fourth, emerging research area, namely sustainabil- ity (Rennings 2000 ). The ﬁrst area, innovation systems, corresponds to studies that inves- tigate the systemic approach to innovation as well as national and regional innovation systems (Cooke, Uranga, and Etxebarria 1997 ; Morgan 1997 ; Lundvall et al. 2002 ; Asheim and Coenen 2005 ; Doloreux and Parto 2005 ; Todtling and Trippl 2005 ; Woolthuis, Lankhuizen, and Gilsing 2005 ). The second area, policy tools, consists of studies that explore policy tools to promote innovation, such as regional innovationPOLICY STUDIES 1123
policies (Morgan 1997 ; Doloreux and Parto 2005 ; Todtling and Trippl 2005 ), systemic innovation policies (Lundvall et al. 2002 ), and eco-innovation policies (Rennings 2000 ). The third area, knowledge management, can be de ﬁned as the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing an organization ’s knowledge and information (Gaviria- Marin, Merigó, and Baier-Fuentes 2019 ). This area is characterized by studies that examine the central role of knowledge in innovation processes and activities (Cooke, Uranga, and Etxebarria 1997 ; Morgan 1997 ; Lundvall et al. 2002 ; Asheim and Coenen 2005 ; Doloreux and Parto 2005 ; Todtling and Trippl 2005 ; Woolthuis, Lankhuizen, and Gilsing 2005 ). Finally, the fourth area, sustainability, contains the study “Redeﬁning innovation –eco-innovation research and the contribution from ecological economics ” (Rennings 2000 ). The study discusses the fact that eco-innovation particularities may help overcome market failure by establishing a speci ﬁc eco-innovation policy and may help avoid a technology bias through a broader understanding of innovation. Thestudy also suggests that the experience gathered in ecological economics —integrating ecological, social, and economic aspects of sustainable development —is useful to open up innovation research to social and institutional changes. The studies in the trunk comprise the four aforementioned research areas, in addition to a ﬁfth emerging research area, namely entrepreneurship (Etzkowitz & Klofster, 2005 ; Hjalager 2010 ). The results show that the research areas of innovation systems, policy tools, and knowledge management have been further developed and broadened. Figure 6.

For instance, policy tools research comprises articles dealing with regional innovation policies (Etzkowitz and Klofsten 2005 ; Fleming, King, and Juda 2007 ; Asheim, Boschma, and Cooke 2011 ), systemic instruments (Smits and Kuhlmann 2004 ), science, technology, and innovation policies (Jensen et al. 2007 ), knowledge-based inno- vation policies (Cowan and Jonard 2004 ; Asheim, Coenen, and Vang 2007 ), policy mixes (Flanagan, Uyarra, and Laranja 2011 ), public procurement (Edler and Georghiou 2007 ), renewable energy innovation policies (Foxon et al. 2005 ), sustainable innovation policies (Schot and Geels 2008 ), agricultural innovation policies (Klerkx, Aarts, and Leeuwis 2010 ), and tourism policies (Hjalager 2010 ). Likewise, sustainability research is well established. It comprises articles that address the role of technological niches in sustain- able transitions (Schot and Geels 2008 ), sustainability in tourism policy (Hjalager 2010 ), the role of demand-oriented innovation policy (Edler and Georghiou 2007 ), and agricul- tural innovation policy (Klerkx, Aarts, and Leeuwis 2010 ) in relation to sustainable devel- opment. Sustainability research also covers the relationship between systemic processes, innovation, and sustainable technologies and energies (Foxon et al. 2005 ). Lastly, regard- ing the emerging research area of entrepreneurship, Etzkowitz and Klofsten ( 2005 ) propose a model of knowledge-based regional development. Innovation policy is created bottom-up as an outcome of collective entrepreneurship through collaboration between business, government, and academic actors (the Triple Helix). Moreover, Hja- lager ( 2010 ) acknowledges key determinants of innovation in tourism, including the role of tourism policy, entrepreneurship, technology push, and the existence of regional industry clusters. The most recent articles show the ﬁve areas that lend structure to the ﬁeld of academic innovation policy research. These articles address diverse issues
structure to the ﬁeld of academic innovation policy research. These articles address diverse issues related to these ﬁve areas. One example is a comprehensive framework for legitimizing and devising policies for trans- formative change drawing on a combination of market failures, structural system failures,and transformational system failures (Weber and Rohracher 2012). A second example is the importance of policy mixes to address the problems of innovation systems (Borrás and Edquist 2013) and achieve sustainable transitions (Kivimaa and Kern 2016). Another area addressed by these articles is the need for a comprehensive global innovation systems perspective to develop policy interventions that re ﬂect the increasing spatial complexity in the innovation process (Binz and Tru ﬀer2017). The research also discusses key trends, chal- lenges, and potential solutions in the current context of open innovation systems (Bogers,Chesbrough, and Moedas 2018). Finally, the research presents the Triple Helix as an analyti- cal construct that brings together the key features of university, industry, and governmentinteractions into an innovation system format (Ranga and Etzkowitz 2013). 4. Discussion and conclusions The aim of this study was to analyze the leading regions and trending topics in academicinnovation policy research using bibliometric techniques based on data from the WoSCC and Scopus databases. The analyses included performance analysis and science mapping. The performance analysis used bibliometric indicators such as number of studies, number of citations, h-index, citations per study, and citations per year to evalu-ate the importance and impact of innovation policy documents. Science mapping usingbibliographic coupling between countries and keyword co-occurrence analysisPOLICY STUDIES 1127
complemented the performance analysis. Bibliometric maps were created using VOS- viewer software. There are other recent studies that exclusively use bibliometric techniques and the WoS CC database to carry out deep analyses on innovation research. Merigó et al. (2016 ) focuses on the most productive and in ﬂuential countries in innovation research between 1989 and 2013 classifying the results in periods of ﬁve years. This study also ana- lyzes the research developed in several supranational regions. The results show that theUK and the USA are the leading countries in innovation research, while Western Europe and North America are the leading supranational regions, followed by East Asia. The leading journals in the ﬁeld are also studied individually identifying the most productive countries in each of the journals, revealing that the publications of each country are biased by the country origin of the journal. Cancino, Merigó, and Coronado ( 2017 ) ana- lyzes the most productive and inﬂ uential authors in innovation research developed between 1989 and 2013 by calculating several author-level bibliometric indicators suchas the total number of publications and citations, and the h-index. The results demon- strate that the most inﬂ uential authors are not necessarily the most productive research- ers. The study also analyzes the most productive and in ﬂuential authors in the leading journals in the ﬁeld, showing that the incorporation of a larger number of journals to the WoS CC has granted di ﬀerent authors access to publish their work on innovation research. Lastly, Cancino et al. ( 2020 ) analyzes the journals and universities that pub- lished research on innovation and entrepreneurship developed by Ibero-American authors between 1986 and 2015. The results show that the most outstanding researchers of the region come from Spain and, lagging some distance behind, Portugal. A smallgroup of researchers from Chile, Argentina, and Mexico are also very in ﬂuential. Our
A smallgroup of researchers from Chile, Argentina, and Mexico are also very in ﬂuential. Our article provides diverse and signi ﬁcant contributions to the bibliometric literature on innovation compared with the aforementioned studies. First, we speci ﬁcally focused on inno- vation policy within the innovation research ﬁeld, and considered all years up to and includ- ing 2020. Besides, we used the WoS CC and Scopus databases to lend robustness to this study and to help overcome the limitations of considering either WoS CC or Scopus in isolation. Our results show that WoS CC under-represents the social sciences and other disciplinessuch as psychology, arts and humanities, as well as non-U.S. journals and research developed by authors a ﬃliated to institutions from non-Western countries. Overall, the UK is the leading country, followed by the Netherlands, the USA, Germany, Sweden, Spain, and Denmark. The regional analysis shows four leading regions: Western Europe (led by the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, and Spain), North America (led by the USA), Scandinavia (led by Sweden and Denmark), and Asia-Paci ﬁc (led by China and Australia). Second, we developed an innovation policy conceptual framework based on the most common keywords within the total set of documents under analysis. The conceptual fra-mework shows a wide range of concepts such as policy and governance, R&D, technol-ogy, knowledge and science, innovation systems including national innovation systems(NIS) and regional innovation systems (RIS), sustainability, ﬁrms and industry, regional development, the Triple Helix model, and entrepreneurship. Interestingly, smart special-ization is the newest keyword in both WoS CC and Scopus, which denotes the increasingimportance of sustainable development within innovation policy research. Third, bibliometrics should not be used for evaluation without referring to more in- depth qualitative assessments (Hicks et al. 2015 ). We therefore reviewed the 28 most1128 P.

inﬂuential innovation policy articles using the Tree of Science approach to complement the bibliometric study with a qualitative analysis. The Tree of Science approach reveals that trending topics are built around ﬁve main pillars: innovation systems, policy tools, knowledge management, sustainability, and entrepreneurship. The concept ofthe innovation system originated between the end of the 1980s and the middle of the 1990s in the context of the European industrial economies ’transformation into knowl- edge-based economics. A national innovation system (NIS) consists of a network of economic agents, together with the institutions and policies that in ﬂuence these agents ’innovation behaviour and performance (Freeman 1987 ; Lundvall 1992 ; Nelson 1993 ). This systemic approach to innovation is generally adopted in developed countries and is often complemented with the Triple Helix model. Whereas business is the central actor in innovation systems, the Triple Helix focuses on three main agents: government, universities, and business. The Triple Helix model has now evolved into the Quadruple/Quintuple Helix model (government, university, industry, knowledge society, and sus- tainability). The Quadruple Helix emphasizes the importance of the knowledge society and knowledge democracy for knowledge production and innovation. The QuintupleHelix stresses the need for the socioecological transition of society and the economy toaddress major issues such as global warming (Carayannis et al. 2018 ; López-Rubio, Roig-Tierno, and Mas-Verdú 2021b ). Fourth, the innovation literature has been historically focused on business, insti- tutions, structures and policies, while entrepreneurship literature has been oriented to the individual or the ﬁrm (Zahra and Wright 2011 ). Based on the analysis of the most common keywords and the most in ﬂuential studies, we propose a Sextuple Helix model. This model consists of the Quintuple Helix (government, university, industry,knowledge
Helix model. This model consists of the Quintuple Helix (government, university, industry,knowledge society, and sustainability) augmented with the additional dimension of entrepreneurship. The Sextuple Helix may have massive potential for academic inno-vation policy research in the current economic context. It also provides an analytical fra-mework where innovation and entrepreneurship coalesce. Finally, several possible limitations of this study should be noted. First, innovation policy documents that are not indexed in the WoS CC or Scopus databases were notincluded in the analysis. Another limitation is the use of the complete counting system, which means that one unit is assigned to each researcher, regardless of the number of authors. Therefore, documents attributed to multiple authors or a ﬃliations tend to have a higher weighting in the analysis than articles with a single author. Despite these limitations, this study nonetheless successfully provides key ﬁndings regarding leading regions and trending topics in academic innovation policy research.

Which regions produce the most innovation policy research? Pedro López-Rubioa, Norat Roig-Tiernoaand Alicia Mas-Turb aDepartment of Economics and Social Science, Universitat Politècnica de València, Valencia, Spain; bDepartamento de Dirección de Empresas, Universitat de València, València, Spain ABSTRACT This article uses the data indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus databases up to and including the year 2020 to map leading regions and trending topics in academic innovation policy research. The country analysis highlights fourleading regions in this research ﬁeld: Western Europe (led by the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, and Spain), North America (led bythe USA), Scandinavia (led by Sweden and Denmark), and Asia- Paciﬁc (led by China and Australia). The most common keywords are used to develop a conceptual framework. Applying the Tree of Science approach, we classify the most in ﬂuential studies into three categories: foundational studies (the roots), structuralstudies (the trunk), and recent studies (the leaves). This approach shows that trending topics are built around ﬁve main pillars: innovation systems, policy tools, knowledge management, sustainability, and entrepreneurship. Finally, based on analysis of the most common keywords and the most in ﬂuential studies, we propose a Sextuple Helix model. This model consists of theQuintuple Helix (government, university, industry, knowledge society, and sustainability) with the added dimension ofentrepreneurship. This model o ﬀers an analytical framework with massive potential for academic research on innovation policy inthe current economic context.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 11 June 2019 Accepted 27 May 2021 KEYWORDS Innovation policy; innovation systems; policy tools; knowledge management;sustainability;entrepreneurship; Sextuple Helix; bibliometrics JEL CLASSIFICATION O29; O30; O38; O10; O57 1. Introduction In recent decades, the number of academic studies of innovation research has grown faster
In recent decades, the number of academic studies of innovation research has grown faster than the number of studies in other areas. This growth suggests that scholars from multiple disciplines are expressing an interest in the e ﬀects of innovation activity and the innovation process on the economy (Merigó et al. 2016 ; Cancino, Merigó, and Coronado 2017 ,2020 ). Innovation policies play a leading role in innovation research, emerging as a new ﬁeld of economic policy in the last few decades. The term “innovation policy ”is now com- monly used given the widespread view that policy plays a role in supporting innovation. Innovation policy attempts to in ﬂuence innovation activity, often to boost economic growth (Fagerberg 2017 ). The origins of the term lie in the intellectual environment that developed around the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at the University of © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis GroupCONTACT Pedro López-Rubio pedloru@doctor.upv.es Department of Economics and Social Science, Universitat Politècnica de València, Camino de Vera, s/n, Valencia, SpainPOLICY STUDIES 2022, VOL. 43, NO. 5, 1112 –1134 https://doi.org/10.1080/01442872.2021.1937595
Sussex from the late 1960s onward (Fagerberg et al. 2011 ). SPRU professor Roy Rothwell did much during the 1980s to increase interest in the topic (Rothwell 1982 ). However, the real surge of interest occurred in the 1990s, when national governments and international organizations, such as the OECD, started to focus on innovation policies that supportcompanies ’innovation via di ﬀerent instruments or tools aimed at improving the business environment (OECD 2011 ; European Commission 2018 ). Scholars around the world have also shown an interest in innovation policy. The resulting body of work explores relevant innovation policy issues such as social problems and gender equality (Fagerberg, Laestadius, and Martin 2015 ; Alsos, Hytti, and Ljungg- ren2016 ), as well as policy design, implementation, and evaluation (Flanagan and Uyarra 2016 ; Edler and Fagerberg 2017 ). This body of work also includes reviews of innovation policies in di ﬀerent countries, regions and continents (McCann and Ortega-Argilés 2015 ; Fu, Woo, and Hou 2016 ; Petersen and Kruss 2019 ). Against this backdrop, the objective of this article is to analyze academic innovation policy research using bibliometrics to map the leading regions and topics in this ﬁeld. There have been several recent bibliometric studies of innovation focused on the leading countries, regions and universities (Merigó et al. 2016 ), the most relevant authors (Cancino, Merigó, and Coronado 2017 ), and the most outstanding researchers of the Ibero-American region (Cancino et al. 2020 ), and related topics such as knowledge management (Gaviria-Marin, Merigó, and Baier-Fuentes 2019 ), and technology transfer (López-Rubio et al. 2021a). However, to the best of our knowledge, no bibliometric studies have focused speci ﬁcally on innovation policy research. The bibliometric analysis conducted in this article deals with diverse indicators to present the annual evolution of publications, the leading countries and regions, the most
to present the annual evolution of publications, the leading countries and regions, the most commonly used keywords, and the most in ﬂuential studies in innovation policy research. Furthermore, to visualize the results clearly and accurately, bibliometric mapping is used. The bibliometric mapping of scienti ﬁc research ﬁelds is based on the quantitative analysis of bibliographic data. As policy support tools, bibliometric maps can provide an overview of the structure of a research ﬁeld and can be used to monitor its evolution (Noyons, Moed, and Van Raan 1999 ). This article includes biblio- metric maps of bibliographic coupling between countries to link documents with asimilar research focus, thereby measuring the shared intellectual background among countries. It also provides maps of keyword co-occurrence to produce a conceptual fra-mework of academic innovation policy research. Lastly, the most inﬂ uential studies are analyzed using the Tree of Science approach to investigate the intellectual structure of this research ﬁeld (Robledo Giraldo, Osorio Zuluaga, and López Espinosa 2014 ). This structure is formed by the “roots, ”“trunk,” and “leaves ”. The roots are where the articles that lay the foundations for the ﬁeld of study can be found. The articles in the trunk lend structure to the research ﬁeld. Finally, the leaves correspond to the most recent articles. Thus, the articles in the roots and trunk give a clear overview of the foundations and evolution, whereas the articles in the leaves indicate where this ﬁeld of research is going. The rest of the article is structured as follows. Section 2describes the bibliometric methods and data used in the article. Section 3presents the results of the bibliometric analysis. Section 4summarizes the main ﬁndings.POLICY STUDIES 1113
2. Bibliometric methods and data The research method used in this article is bibliometric analysis. Bibliometrics (Pritchard 1969 ) refers to the study of all quantitative aspects of bibliographic material (Broadus 1987 ). The most commonly used bibliometric indicators include the total number of studies, the total number of citations, and the h-index (Hirsch 2005 ; Gaviria-Marin, Merigó, and Baier-Fuentes 2019 ). The total number of studies is a proxy for productivity, whereas the total number of citations and the h-index are proxies for in ﬂuence and impact. Both types of variables should be considered in a bibliometric analysis. Doingso provides a more accurate and objective measure of scienti ﬁc production. Neither a large number of publications nor a large number of citations necessarily implieshigher research quality. The h-index tries to overcome these drawbacks by accountingfor both the number of studies and the number of citations. However, the h-index hassome limitations. For instance, a researcher with few articles but many citations might have the same h-index as a researcher with many articles, not all of which are highly cited (Egghe 2006 ). This problem can be overcome by calculating other indicators to improve the accuracy of the bibliometric analysis. Such indicators include citations per year and citations per study (Gaviria-Marin, Merigó, and Baier-Fuentes 2019 ). The most common bibliometric mapping approaches are based on bibliographic coupling, co-citations, co-authorship, and keyword co-occurrence. Bibliographic coup-ling measures the shared intellectual background of a set of documents. A strength value is calculated between documents in the sample based on the references sharedby each two documents (Kessler 1963 ). The more shared references there are, the stron- ger the theoretical foundations shared by the two documents are assumed to be. Biblio-graphic coupling makes it possible to link documents with a similar research focus,thereby --- Biblio-graphic coupling makes it possible to link documents with a similar research focus,thereby revealing the knowledge structure of a ﬁeld (Jarvening 2007 ). Co-citation analysis identi ﬁes the shared background of publications in a data set. Two documents are co- cited if one or more documents cite both articles (Small 1973 ). The weighting of a co-cita- tion is based on the number of articles that co-cite the two documents. It reveals anetwork of cited documents rather than linking the documents in the data set (Garﬁeld2001 ). Co-authorship identi ﬁes research collaboration networks based on the number of co-authored documents (White and Griﬃ th1981 ). Lastly, keyword co-occur- rence identi ﬁes links among research topics in a particular ﬁeld based on the frequency of co-occurrence of keywords in documents. It also tracks developments in that ﬁeld (Callon et al. 1983 ). 2.1. Data Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and Google Scholar are the most commonly used scien- tiﬁc databases. WoS, currently owned by Clarivate Analytics, is the oldest citation resource. Scopus and Google Scholar were launched in 2004 by Elsevier and Google Inc. respectively. Google Scholar provides a broader range of data sources, including more books, conference papers, and non-US journals (Harzing and Van der Wal 2008 ). WoS is the most restrictive in its coverage of materials. WoS excludes almost all books, and its coverage of social science works is known to be far narrower than itscoverage of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM)1114 P. LÓPEZ-RUBIO ET AL.
sciences, in terms of both the types of literature and the scope of the journals (Van Leeuwen 2006 ; Norris and Oppenheim 2007 ). Adriaanse and Rensleigh ( 2013 ) observed that WoS performed best in terms of total coverage of the journal sample population and retrieved the most unique items. Further- more, their investigation into multiple copies indicated that WoS and Scopus retrieved no duplicates, whereas Google Scholar retrieved multiple copies. Lastly, Scopus delivered the fewest inconsistencies regarding content veri ﬁcation and content quality, whereas Google Scholar retrieved the most inconsistencies. Examples of these inconsistencies included author spelling, author sequence, volume, and issue number. Regarding bibliometric mapping, diverse bibliographic software tools can be used to map the data gathered from WoS and Scopus. Each of these tools has certain advantagesand drawbacks (Cobo et al. 2011 ). In the case of Google Scholar, Publish or Perish soft- ware can retrieve the raw citations and calculate a range of metrics such as total studies and citations, average citations per study, citations per author, studies per author, cita- tions per year, Hirsch ’s h-index, and Egghe ’s g-index (Harzing 2007 ). However, there is no tool to produce bibliometric maps based on Google Scholar data. Accordingly, we chose WoS Core Collection (WoS CC) and Scopus as data sources. These databases made it possible to produce bibliometric maps to address the maingoals of this article. We used VOSviewer for this purpose because it supports all the maps required for this study (Van Eck and Waltman 2010 ). Including both databases partially overcame the poor coverage of the social sciences and non-U.S. journals pro- vided by WoS. We selected only peer-review studies. Speci ﬁcally, we selected only articles and reviews (book reviews were excluded). The peer-review process is generally considered a guaran-tee of quality within academia. The importance of this process has been
considered a guaran-tee of quality within academia. The importance of this process has been evident during the current COVID-19 crises, with the rapid publication of COVID-19 literature throughexpedited review and preprint publications providing important resources for themedical and scienti ﬁc community. However, there are always risks of unveri ﬁed infor- mation and information without solid evidence being used to in ﬂuence policy decisions (Bagsadarian, Cross, and Fisher 2020 ). Finally, we reviewed and analyzed the most in ﬂuential studies using the Tree of Science approach. This approach consists of placing articles into three categories:roots, trunk, and leaves. The roots contain articles that provide a theoretical and concep-tual foundation. The articles that lend structure to the ﬁeld appear in the trunk. Lastly, the leaves are made up of the most recent articles, revealing trends in intellectual devel-opment (Robledo Giraldo, Osorio Zuluaga, and López Espinosa 2014 ). The search performed in the WoS CC and Scopus databases was Topic = “innovation policy ”OR“innovation policies ”OR“policy of innovation ”OR“policies of innovation ”, where the ﬁeldTopic included the publication title, abstract, and keywords. This search was conducted in January 2021 and covered all years up to and including 2020. It returned3,297 documents in WoS CC and 4,104 documents in Scopus. Our analysis included only articles and reviews. Therefore, the results of the search were reduced to 2,537 studies (2,458 articles and 79 reviews) in WoS CC (77% of all innovation policy publicationsindexed in WoS CC) and 3,069 studies (2,909 articles and 160 reviews) in Scopus (75% of all innovation policy publications indexed in Scopus). According to these results, Scopus had approximately 20% more innovation policy studies than WoS CC.POLICY STUDIES 1115
Table 1 shows the top 10 research areas in terms of number of innovation policy studies indexed in WoS CC and Scopus. One study can cover more than one research area. These results corroborate under-representation of social sciences and other disci- plines such as psychology, arts, and humanities in WoS CC. 3. Results This section presents the main bibliometric results for the selected set of innovation policy research documents indexed in WoS CC and Scopus between 1960 and 2020. The search was conducted in January 2021 and identi ﬁed 2,537 studies in WoS CC and 3,069 studies in Scopus up to and including 2020. 3.1. Annual evolution of publications Figure 1 shows the annual total number of academic publications on innovation policy according to data from WoS CC and Scopus. The ﬁrst study in Scopus, “Innovation in indus- try: a discussion of the state-of-art and the results of innovation research in German-speaking countries ”(Uhlmann 1975), was published in 1975. The ﬁrst two studies in WoS CC were published in 1982: “Government innovation policy: some past problems and recent trends ” (Rothwell 1982)a n d “Some aspects of technological innovation policy ”(Drulovic 1982). From 1982 onward, the production of documents indexed in both databases has been steady, with a substantial increase in innovation policy research since 2005. This increase has mainly been driven by three factors. First, research production improved consider- ably with the rapid development of the Internet and computers. These developmentsmade data collection easier and allowed access to the latest trends in this (and indeed vir- tually any) research ﬁeld. Second, there has been a sharp increase in the number of researchers from developing countries. Third, this period witnessed the emergence of knowledge economies (Lundvall 2016 ). 3.2.

aﬃliations at the same time. Therefore, a single author may have publications corre- sponding to two or more countries. In this analysis, country a ﬃliation refers to the country where the author was working at the time the relevant document was published. Table 2 presents the 20 most productive countries in innovation policy research according to the data from WoS CC and Scopus. This table includes the total number of studies (a proxy for absolute productivity), total number of citations (a proxy for absol-ute inﬂ uence), h-index (which represents a combined measure of productivity and inﬂuence), and citations per study (a proxy for e ﬃciency).

Therefore, the results may be interpreted in di ﬀerent ways depending on the interests of the researchers. Interestingly, both top 20 rankings comprise the same countries, with the exception of Poland (ranked 20th in WoS CC) and South Korea(ranked 20th in Scopus). Of the other 19 countries, nine are in Western Europe (theUK, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Italy, France, Austria, Belgium, and Portugal), two (the USA and Canada) are in North America, four are Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Denmark), and one is in each of Eastern Europe (Russia), Asia(China), Oceania (Australia), and South America (Brazil). Overall (considering both databases and all indicators), the UK leads the academic innovation policy research rankings, followed by the Netherlands, the USA, Germany,Sweden, Spain, and Denmark. Russia, Brazil, and Poland have better results in terms of productivity (total studies) than in terms of in ﬂuence (total citations, h-index, and citations per study). The regional analysis highlights four leading geographical areas in thisﬁeld: Western Europe (led by the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, and Spain), North America (led by the USA), Scandinavia (led by Sweden and Denmark), andAsia-Paci ﬁc (led by China and Australia). The bibliographic coupling of the main countries in innovation policy research based on the authors’ aﬃliation is also of interest. Bibliographic coupling links docu- ments with a similar research focus. It thereby measures the shared intellectual back-ground of di ﬀerent countries. Figures 2 and 3depict the maps of bibliographic coupling between countries for the WoS CC and Scopus databases, respectively. Only the 200 most representative links and countries with at least 20 innovation policy studies were included (32 countries in WoS CC and 38 countries in Scopus).In the VOSviewer network visualization, the size of the label and the circle of an item are determined by its weighting. The colour of an item is determined by

and the circle of an item are determined by its weighting. The colour of an item is determined by the cluster to which it belongs. There are six additional countries or territories in the Scopus bibliographic coupling map compared with the WoS CC map: Kazakhstan (with 31 studies), Hungary (27), Hong Kong and Greece (21 each), and New Zealand and Argentina (20 each). As expected, all of them are peripheral nodes. WoS CC and Scopus Clusters 1 (red) comprisecountries from Europe and Asia, plus the USA, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa. According to the size and position of the circles, the UK, the USA, Russia, and France can be considered the main nodes in WoS CC Cluster 1, and theUSA, Russia, and Canada in Scopus Cluster 1. Russia is the only Eastern European country in WoS CC Cluster 1, while Scopus Cluster 1 contains ﬁve countries from this region (Russia, Poland, Estonia, Ukraine, and Hungary). Surprisingly, despite China has more publications than France or Canada, it occupies a more peripheral position. Clusters 2 (green) exclusively comprise European countries: WoS CC Cluster 2 contains Western and Eastern European countries and is centred on Spain and Italy; ScopusCluster 2 central nodes are the UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Finland, and it containsWestern European and Nordic countries, plus Slovakia and Czech Republic. Lastly, WoS CC Cluster 3 (blue) is centred on Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Finland, and includes Western European and Nordic countries, while Scopus Cluster 3 (blue) isformed by the Netherlands, Switzerland, New Zealand, and Japan. Overall, these results show similar trends, but some di ﬀerences, between WoS CC and Scopus. Such diﬀerences can be explained as a consequence of the broader Scopus coverage of non-1118 P.

U.S. journals and of research developed by authors a ﬃliated to institutions from countries outside the leading regions in academic innovation policy. 3.3. Analysis of the most common keywords in academic innovation policy research This section presents a conceptual framework and describes the cognitive state and evol- ution of academic innovation policy research. According to Callon et al. ( 1983 ), analysis of the co-occurrence of keywords studies the conceptual structure of a research ﬁeld. Figures 4 and5provide a bibliometric mapping of the co-occurrence of the 50 most common keywords in innovation policy research according to the data from WoS CC and Scopus, respectively. The 200 strongest links were represented, and all types of key- words were considered to produce these maps: author keywords, keywords established byWoS CC (KeyWords Plus ), and keywords established by Scopus ( Index Keywords ). The size of the circles associated with each keyword and their centrality gives an idea ofthe prominence of the di ﬀerent concepts within the framework. Besides, the distance between two keywords in the visualization approximately indicates the relatedness of the keywords in terms of co-occurrence links. In general, the closer the two keywords are located to each other, the stronger their relatedness (Van Eck and Waltman 2010 ). To observe how the use of these keywords has evolved, the VOSviewer overlay visualiza-tion and the average publication year variable were used. In this kind of visualization, the Figure 2. Bibliographic coupling of countries according to data from WoS CC.POLICY STUDIES 1119

colour of the item indicates its average publication year. Table 3 presents these keywords, along with the number of occurrences and co-occurrences and the average publication year. The concepts captured by the keywords are diverse. However, most relate to factors and agents that have impact on innovation such as di ﬀerent kind of policies, R&D, tech- nology, knowledge, science, ﬁrms, industry, universities, networks, governance, invest- ment, sustainability, entrepreneurship, and collaboration; the dynamics or outputs of innovation like performance, technological and regional development, economic growth and development, productivity, and competitiveness; and innovation modelsincluding national innovation systems (NIS; Freeman 1987 ; Lundvall 1992 ; Nelson 1993 ), regional innovation systems (RIS; Cooke 1992 ), and the Triple Helix (Etzkowitz and Leydesdor ﬀ2000 ). According to the WoS CC keyword co-occurrence map, there are 10 links of the 200 most representative ones that involve the keyword impact. Such links are between impact and the following keywords: innovation (co-occurrence link strength of 57), innovation policy (co-occurrence link strength of 49), R&D (co-occurrence link strength of 41), per-formance (co-occurrence link strength of 33), technology (co-occurrence link strength of 30), knowledge (co-occurrence link strength of 26), policy and ﬁrms (co-occurrence link strength of 23 each), systems (co-occurrence link strength of 18), and collaboration (co- occurrence link strength of 17). All these keywords are among the 10 most common key- words, except for collaboration. This denotes the relevance of the relationship between impact and collaboration, despite collaboration is the 31st most common keyword inWoS CC. Furthermore, the analysis of the co-occurrence link strengths together withthe distance between keywords shows that the concept impact has a primary degree of Figure 5. Map of keyword co-occurrence according to data from Scopus.POLICY STUDIES
degree of Figure 5. Map of keyword co-occurrence according to data from Scopus.POLICY STUDIES 1121
relatedness with innovation, innovation policy, R&D, performance and technology, and a secondary degree with knowledge, policy, ﬁrms, systems and collaboration. Interestingly, smart specialization is the newest keyword in WoS CC and Scopus. This keyword is the only one with an average publication year post-2018 and occupies a per-ipheral position in WoS CC and Scopus keyword co-occurrence maps, probably becauseTable 3.

it is a recent research topic. Smart specialization has become central to the development of a reformed economic, social, and regional European cohesion policy. It is based on the principles of smart, green, and inclusive growth. Smart specialization is aimed at achiev-ing a sustainable development model based on individual regional speciﬁ cities (McCann and Ortega-Argilés 2015 ). Therefore, sustainable development is becoming increasingly important within innovation policy research. 3.4. Analysis of the most in ﬂuential studies in academic innovation policy research There are many inﬂ uential articles on innovation policy. One method to identify them is to classify publications based on the number of citations, which re ﬂects the inﬂ uence, popularity, and attention received from the scienti ﬁc community. However, the total number of citations beneﬁ ts older articles because they have longer to accumulate cita- tions. Therefore, we also included the citations per year (López-Rubio, Roig-Tierno, and Mas-Tur 2020 ). In this section, the intellectual structure of innovation policy research is outlined by analyzing the most inﬂ uential articles. To determine the most in ﬂuential articles, we applied two criteria: (1) The 20 most cited studies (2) The 20 studies with the highest number of citations per year. Based on these criteria, there are 28 in ﬂuential studies: 23 of these studies meet the cri- teria in both databases, two studies meet the criteria in WoS but not in Scopus (Etzkowitz and Klofsten 2005 ; Binz and Truffer 2017 ), and three studies meet the criteria in Scopus but are not indexed in WoS CC (Smits and Kuhlmann 2004 ; Doloreux and Parto 2005 ; Ranga and Etzkowitz 2013 ). Applying the Tree of Science approach (Robledo Giraldo, Osorio Zuluaga, and López Espinosa 2014 ) to these data, we produced the Tree of Science for academic innovation policy research. This tree is made up of three categories: the roots, which contain thestudies that provide the
This tree is made up of three categories: the roots, which contain thestudies that provide the theoretical and conceptual foundation; the trunk, which lendsstructure to the ﬁeld; and the leaves, which are the most recent studies that enable identi ﬁcation of trends in intellectual development. Figure 6 shows the studies in the Tree of Science and Table 4 summarizes the analysis of these documents, including their main innovation policy-related topics. According to them, we labelled the research areas addressed by the studies. The studies in the roots are focused on three main research areas that lay the foun- dations for academic innovation policy research (innovation systems, policy tools, andknowledge management) as well as a fourth, emerging research area, namely sustainabil- ity (Rennings 2000 ). The ﬁrst area, innovation systems, corresponds to studies that inves- tigate the systemic approach to innovation as well as national and regional innovation systems (Cooke, Uranga, and Etxebarria 1997 ; Morgan 1997 ; Lundvall et al. 2002 ; Asheim and Coenen 2005 ; Doloreux and Parto 2005 ; Todtling and Trippl 2005 ; Woolthuis, Lankhuizen, and Gilsing 2005 ). The second area, policy tools, consists of studies that explore policy tools to promote innovation, such as regional innovationPOLICY STUDIES 1123
policies (Morgan 1997 ; Doloreux and Parto 2005 ; Todtling and Trippl 2005 ), systemic innovation policies (Lundvall et al. 2002 ), and eco-innovation policies (Rennings 2000 ). The third area, knowledge management, can be de ﬁned as the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing an organization ’s knowledge and information (Gaviria- Marin, Merigó, and Baier-Fuentes 2019 ). This area is characterized by studies that examine the central role of knowledge in innovation processes and activities (Cooke, Uranga, and Etxebarria 1997 ; Morgan 1997 ; Lundvall et al. 2002 ; Asheim and Coenen 2005 ; Doloreux and Parto 2005 ; Todtling and Trippl 2005 ; Woolthuis, Lankhuizen, and Gilsing 2005 ). Finally, the fourth area, sustainability, contains the study “Redeﬁning innovation –eco-innovation research and the contribution from ecological economics ” (Rennings 2000 ). The study discusses the fact that eco-innovation particularities may help overcome market failure by establishing a speci ﬁc eco-innovation policy and may help avoid a technology bias through a broader understanding of innovation. Thestudy also suggests that the experience gathered in ecological economics —integrating ecological, social, and economic aspects of sustainable development —is useful to open up innovation research to social and institutional changes. The studies in the trunk comprise the four aforementioned research areas, in addition to a ﬁfth emerging research area, namely entrepreneurship (Etzkowitz & Klofster, 2005 ; Hjalager 2010 ). The results show that the research areas of innovation systems, policy tools, and knowledge management have been further developed and broadened. Figure 6.

For instance, policy tools research comprises articles dealing with regional innovation policies (Etzkowitz and Klofsten 2005 ; Fleming, King, and Juda 2007 ; Asheim, Boschma, and Cooke 2011 ), systemic instruments (Smits and Kuhlmann 2004 ), science, technology, and innovation policies (Jensen et al. 2007 ), knowledge-based inno- vation policies (Cowan and Jonard 2004 ; Asheim, Coenen, and Vang 2007 ), policy mixes (Flanagan, Uyarra, and Laranja 2011 ), public procurement (Edler and Georghiou 2007 ), renewable energy innovation policies (Foxon et al. 2005 ), sustainable innovation policies (Schot and Geels 2008 ), agricultural innovation policies (Klerkx, Aarts, and Leeuwis 2010 ), and tourism policies (Hjalager 2010 ). Likewise, sustainability research is well established. It comprises articles that address the role of technological niches in sustain- able transitions (Schot and Geels 2008 ), sustainability in tourism policy (Hjalager 2010 ), the role of demand-oriented innovation policy (Edler and Georghiou 2007 ), and agricul- tural innovation policy (Klerkx, Aarts, and Leeuwis 2010 ) in relation to sustainable devel- opment. Sustainability research also covers the relationship between systemic processes, innovation, and sustainable technologies and energies (Foxon et al. 2005 ). Lastly, regard- ing the emerging research area of entrepreneurship, Etzkowitz and Klofsten ( 2005 ) propose a model of knowledge-based regional development. Innovation policy is created bottom-up as an outcome of collective entrepreneurship through collaboration between business, government, and academic actors (the Triple Helix). Moreover, Hja- lager ( 2010 ) acknowledges key determinants of innovation in tourism, including the role of tourism policy, entrepreneurship, technology push, and the existence of regional industry clusters. The most recent articles show the ﬁve areas that lend structure to the ﬁeld of academic innovation policy research. These articles address diverse issues --- structure to the ﬁeld of academic innovation policy research. These articles address diverse issues related to these ﬁve areas. One example is a comprehensive framework for legitimizing and devising policies for trans- formative change drawing on a combination of market failures, structural system failures,and transformational system failures (Weber and Rohracher 2012). A second example is the importance of policy mixes to address the problems of innovation systems (Borrás and Edquist 2013) and achieve sustainable transitions (Kivimaa and Kern 2016). Another area addressed by these articles is the need for a comprehensive global innovation systems perspective to develop policy interventions that re ﬂect the increasing spatial complexity in the innovation process (Binz and Tru ﬀer2017). The research also discusses key trends, chal- lenges, and potential solutions in the current context of open innovation systems (Bogers,Chesbrough, and Moedas 2018). Finally, the research presents the Triple Helix as an analyti- cal construct that brings together the key features of university, industry, and governmentinteractions into an innovation system format (Ranga and Etzkowitz 2013). 4. Discussion and conclusions The aim of this study was to analyze the leading regions and trending topics in academicinnovation policy research using bibliometric techniques based on data from the WoSCC and Scopus databases. The analyses included performance analysis and science mapping. The performance analysis used bibliometric indicators such as number of studies, number of citations, h-index, citations per study, and citations per year to evalu-ate the importance and impact of innovation policy documents. Science mapping usingbibliographic coupling between countries and keyword co-occurrence analysisPOLICY STUDIES 1127
complemented the performance analysis. Bibliometric maps were created using VOS- viewer software. There are other recent studies that exclusively use bibliometric techniques and the WoS CC database to carry out deep analyses on innovation research. Merigó et al. (2016 ) focuses on the most productive and in ﬂuential countries in innovation research between 1989 and 2013 classifying the results in periods of ﬁve years. This study also ana- lyzes the research developed in several supranational regions. The results show that theUK and the USA are the leading countries in innovation research, while Western Europe and North America are the leading supranational regions, followed by East Asia. The leading journals in the ﬁeld are also studied individually identifying the most productive countries in each of the journals, revealing that the publications of each country are biased by the country origin of the journal. Cancino, Merigó, and Coronado ( 2017 ) ana- lyzes the most productive and inﬂ uential authors in innovation research developed between 1989 and 2013 by calculating several author-level bibliometric indicators suchas the total number of publications and citations, and the h-index. The results demon- strate that the most inﬂ uential authors are not necessarily the most productive research- ers. The study also analyzes the most productive and in ﬂuential authors in the leading journals in the ﬁeld, showing that the incorporation of a larger number of journals to the WoS CC has granted di ﬀerent authors access to publish their work on innovation research. Lastly, Cancino et al. ( 2020 ) analyzes the journals and universities that pub- lished research on innovation and entrepreneurship developed by Ibero-American authors between 1986 and 2015. The results show that the most outstanding researchers of the region come from Spain and, lagging some distance behind, Portugal. A smallgroup of researchers from Chile, Argentina, and Mexico are also very in ﬂuential. Our
A smallgroup of researchers from Chile, Argentina, and Mexico are also very in ﬂuential. Our article provides diverse and signi ﬁcant contributions to the bibliometric literature on innovation compared with the aforementioned studies. First, we speci ﬁcally focused on inno- vation policy within the innovation research ﬁeld, and considered all years up to and includ- ing 2020. Besides, we used the WoS CC and Scopus databases to lend robustness to this study and to help overcome the limitations of considering either WoS CC or Scopus in isolation. Our results show that WoS CC under-represents the social sciences and other disciplinessuch as psychology, arts and humanities, as well as non-U.S. journals and research developed by authors a ﬃliated to institutions from non-Western countries. Overall, the UK is the leading country, followed by the Netherlands, the USA, Germany, Sweden, Spain, and Denmark. The regional analysis shows four leading regions: Western Europe (led by the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, and Spain), North America (led by the USA), Scandinavia (led by Sweden and Denmark), and Asia-Paci ﬁc (led by China and Australia). Second, we developed an innovation policy conceptual framework based on the most common keywords within the total set of documents under analysis. The conceptual fra-mework shows a wide range of concepts such as policy and governance, R&D, technol-ogy, knowledge and science, innovation systems including national innovation systems(NIS) and regional innovation systems (RIS), sustainability, ﬁrms and industry, regional development, the Triple Helix model, and entrepreneurship. Interestingly, smart special-ization is the newest keyword in both WoS CC and Scopus, which denotes the increasingimportance of sustainable development within innovation policy research. Third, bibliometrics should not be used for evaluation without referring to more in- depth qualitative assessments (Hicks et al. 2015 ). We therefore reviewed the 28 most1128 P.

inﬂuential innovation policy articles using the Tree of Science approach to complement the bibliometric study with a qualitative analysis. The Tree of Science approach reveals that trending topics are built around ﬁve main pillars: innovation systems, policy tools, knowledge management, sustainability, and entrepreneurship. The concept ofthe innovation system originated between the end of the 1980s and the middle of the 1990s in the context of the European industrial economies ’transformation into knowl- edge-based economics. A national innovation system (NIS) consists of a network of economic agents, together with the institutions and policies that in ﬂuence these agents ’innovation behaviour and performance (Freeman 1987 ; Lundvall 1992 ; Nelson 1993 ). This systemic approach to innovation is generally adopted in developed countries and is often complemented with the Triple Helix model. Whereas business is the central actor in innovation systems, the Triple Helix focuses on three main agents: government, universities, and business. The Triple Helix model has now evolved into the Quadruple/Quintuple Helix model (government, university, industry, knowledge society, and sus- tainability). The Quadruple Helix emphasizes the importance of the knowledge society and knowledge democracy for knowledge production and innovation. The QuintupleHelix stresses the need for the socioecological transition of society and the economy toaddress major issues such as global warming (Carayannis et al. 2018 ; López-Rubio, Roig-Tierno, and Mas-Verdú 2021b ). Fourth, the innovation literature has been historically focused on business, insti- tutions, structures and policies, while entrepreneurship literature has been oriented to the individual or the ﬁrm (Zahra and Wright 2011 ). Based on the analysis of the most common keywords and the most in ﬂuential studies, we propose a Sextuple Helix model. This model consists of the Quintuple Helix (government, university, industry,knowledge --- Helix model. This model consists of the Quintuple Helix (government, university, industry,knowledge society, and sustainability) augmented with the additional dimension of entrepreneurship. The Sextuple Helix may have massive potential for academic inno-vation policy research in the current economic context. It also provides an analytical fra-mework where innovation and entrepreneurship coalesce. Finally, several possible limitations of this study should be noted. First, innovation policy documents that are not indexed in the WoS CC or Scopus databases were notincluded in the analysis. Another limitation is the use of the complete counting system, which means that one unit is assigned to each researcher, regardless of the number of authors. Therefore, documents attributed to multiple authors or a ﬃliations tend to have a higher weighting in the analysis than articles with a single author. Despite these limitations, this study nonetheless successfully provides key ﬁndings regarding leading regions and trending topics in academic innovation policy research.

En el artículo "Which regions produce the most innovation policy research?" de Pedro López-Rubio, Norat Roig-Tierno y Alicia Mas-Tur, publicado en Policy Studies, se explora qué regiones son más activas en la producción de investigación en políticas de innovación. Los autores, expertos en el campo de la política de innovación y el desarrollo regional, presentan sus hallazgos basados en metodologías cuantitativas y cualitativas.

Pedro López-Rubio, con un doctorado en Economía de la Universitat Politècnica de València, se enfoca en la política de innovación y modelos. Ha presentado trabajos en conferencias internacionales y ha publicado artículos en revistas prestigiosas como el Journal of the Knowledge Economy y el International Journal of Quality Innovation.

Norat Roig-Tierno, profesor en la Universitat Politècnica de Valéncia, se especializa en innovación y desarrollo regional. Aplica metodologías cualitativas en su investigación y ha publicado artículos y libros en revistas internacionales como Applied Geography y el Journal of Human Development and Capabilities.

Alicia Mas-Tur, profesora en la Universitat de València, también está involucrada en la investigación en innovación y ha presentado trabajos en conferencias internacionales. Ha publicado artículos en revistas como el Service Industries Journal y el International Entrepreneurship and Management Journal.

El trabajo de los autores fue apoyado por subvenciones de la Generalitat Valenciana y el Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades. Su investigación contribuye a la comprensión de la política de innovación y el desarrollo regional, arrojando luz sobre las regiones líderes en la producción de investigación en este campo.

En general, el artículo proporciona información valiosa sobre el panorama de la investigación en políticas de innovación y destaca las contribuciones de diferentes regiones a esta importante área de estudio. El objetivo del artículo es mapear las regiones líderes y los temas de tendencia en la investigación académica en políticas de innovación utilizando datos de la Web of Science Core Collection y Scopus hasta el año 2020.

El análisis por país revela que cuatro regiones destacan en este campo de investigación: Europa Occidental (liderada por el Reino Unido, los Países Bajos, Alemania y España), América del Norte (liderada por Estados Unidos), Escandinavia (liderada por Suecia y Dinamarca) y Asia-Pacífico (liderada por China y Australia). Estas regiones están a la vanguardia de la investigación en políticas de innovación.

Las palabras clave más comunes en la investigación se utilizan para desarrollar un marco conceptual. Se aplica el enfoque del Árbol de la Ciencia para clasificar los estudios más influyentes en tres categorías: estudios fundamentales (las raíces), estudios estructurales (el tronco) y estudios recientes (las hojas). Este enfoque destaca cinco pilares principales en torno a los cuales se construyen los temas de tendencia: sistemas de innovación, herramientas de política, gestión del conocimiento, sostenibilidad y emprendimiento.

Basándose en el análisis de las palabras clave comunes y los estudios influyentes, se propone un modelo de Sextuple Hélice. Este modelo amplía el modelo de la Quintuple Hélice al agregar el emprendimiento como una dimensión adicional. El modelo de Sextuple Hélice ofrece un marco analítico con un potencial significativo para la investigación académica en políticas de innovación en el contexto económico actual.

En resumen, el artículo proporciona una visión detallada de las regiones líderes en la producción de investigación en políticas de innovación y destaca los temas de tendencia en este campo. Destaca la importancia de la colaboración entre gobierno, universidad, industria, sociedad del conocimiento, sostenibilidad y emprendimiento para impulsar la investigación en políticas de innovación hacia adelante.
