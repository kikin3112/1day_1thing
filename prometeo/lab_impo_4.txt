University laboratories are re sponsible for providing profess ional venues for practical  teaching and scientific researc h, and the quality of their mana gement can directly affect the  quality of research and research work in universities. At prese nt, there are some problems in the  laboratory management of colleges and universities in China, su ch as imperfect laboratory  management system, imperfect laboratory personnel allocation an d management, incomplete  laboratory infrastructure construction, and incomplete laborato ry safety management. In view of  these problems, this paper puts forward five aspects of univers ity laboratory management  countermeasures.  1. Introduction  University laboratory is an important place for practical teach ing and scientific research in Colleges and  universities. It is also the main base for cultivating college students' practical skills and cultivating  compound talents. The level of l aboratory management will direc tly affect the development of daily  practical teaching, the output of scientific research results a nd the training quality o f talents in Colleges  and
the output of scientific research results a nd the training quality o f talents in Colleges  and universities. Therefore, labor atory management plays an imp ortant role in the development of  colleges and universities [1].  1.1 Laboratory is an important part of personnel training  Advanced experimental activities refer to experiments that cann ot be completed in a simple environment.  Generally, such experiments are characterized by complexity and  danger. Generally speaking, simple  experimental teachers can carry out simple demonstration operat ion in the classroom, and students can  realize their teaching function by simulation operation. But in  the university environment, with the  continuous growth of students' learning level and knowledge exp erience, the experimental content  involved in the teaching process will become more and more comp lex. At this time, teachers still use  simple experiments as teaching methods, which can not meet the increasing interest of college students  [2-3]. Based on this, colleges and universities choose to build  a special laboratory for teachers to carry  out more complex practical teaching. The basic structure of uni versity laboratory is the equipment,  materials, digital operating system and so on. And the laborato ry periphery also has strong protection  measures, can undertake the vast majority of experimental activ ities with teaching function. Compared  with the traditional classroom, its security, practicability an d freedom have absolute technical
ICAMME 2020 Journal of Physics: Conference Series 1798 (2021) 012006IOP Publishing doi:10.1088/1742-6596/1798/1/012006 2          advantages. Therefore, the most essential task of university la boratory construction is to provide  necessary conditions for teachers and students to carry out adv anced experimental activities.  1.2 Laboratory is the key driving force to a ccelerate domestic technology development level  Although the essence of colleges and universities is teaching, and the academic research ability of  college students has not reached a certain height. But in fact,  colleges and universities are also an  important place to tap the talents of college students and full y stimulate the potential of teachers. The  ideal goal of colleges and universities is not only to provide teaching services, but also to make  substantial contributions to technological and academic develop ment. The laboratory is an important  medium to test theory knowledge and provide practical space for  teachers and professors. The proper  construction of laboratories in  Colleges and universities can p romote the efficiency of experimental  activities in Colleges and universities to a certain extent, so  that teachers and students can carry out  innovative activities more flexibly and freely. Thus, to a cert ain extent, it will drive the whole university  to establish a positive academic research atmosphere, incubate more technology R & D projects, and  then upgrade the possibility of accelerating domestic technolog y development level[4].  1.3 Laboratory is an important  component to upgrade the strength of running a university  Colleges and universities need to absorb higher quality talents  of college students, teaching and scientific  research to ensure their compre hensive competitive position. Fo r high-quality talents, they do not pay  attention to what kind of econom ic conditions colleges and univ ersities can provide for themselves.  They pay more attention to wheth er
colleges and univ ersities can provide for themselves.  They pay more attention to wheth er colleges and universities ca n provide space for their talents. The  construction quality of university  laboratory represents the st rength of capital resources, the prospective  thinking and the breadth of vision. These are exactly what high -quality talents will consider. Therefore,  when colleges and universities continue to optimize the quality  of laboratories in order to build  laboratories that are more in line with the characteristics of the times and can provide the best assistance  for the study and research work, they can attract more high-qua lity talents to join the colleges and  universities [5]. Furthermore, the school running strength of c olleges and universities can be steadily  upgraded and occupy a favorable position in the talent competit ion situation.  2. Existing problems  2.1 Problems of imperfect management system  At present, the management system of university laboratory is n ot standardized and the implementation  is not in place. Although some of  the relevant systems have bee n formulated, they are not implemented  in place, and there are no unified standard requirements. For e xample, the laboratory safety management  system, the system is generally not perfect, mere formality, th ere is no corresponding management  measures according to the actual situation of the laboratory.[2 ] Laboratory instrument management,  drug management, equipment use ma nagement, use management of da ngerous and highly toxic  substances, personnel management  and other systems need to be i mproved and perfected. The lack and  confusion of these systems lead to the low efficiency of labora tory management and more security risks.  2.2 The management personnel's enthusiasm is not high  University laboratory management  personnel generally belong to the teaching and r esearch section, not  only to carry out laboratory management, but also need to take into account
r esearch section, not  only to carry out laboratory management, but also need to take into account other types of work, such  as teaching and research, which w ill lead to laboratory managem ent personnel can not be fully engaged  in laboratory management. There are a lot of miscellaneous thin gs in the laboratory,  and the laboratory  management personnel have higher requirements for the promotion  of professional titles in Colleges  and universities, which leads to the lack of enthusiasm and ini tiative of laboratory technicians.
ICAMME 2020 Journal of Physics: Conference Series 1798 (2021) 012006IOP Publishing doi:10.1088/1742-6596/1798/1/012006 3          2.3Low utilization rate of equipment and funds  According to the actual survey, not all colleges and universiti es will take the laboratory construction as  a key project. As a result, some colleges and universities allo cate less funds for laboratory construction,  and can only configure relatively basic and less equipment. How ever, the low-end equipment is often  unable to match the new teaching tasks, even if college student s urgently need to participate in practical  experiments to test theoretical knowledge. It will also give up  the idea of practice because the equipment  can not support advanced experimental activities, resulting in low utilization of laboratory equipment.  It is also a common problem in the laboratory management of col leges and universities that the fund  application is not scientifically planned. When the purchase ap plication is submitted, it is not confirmed  whether the purchase is repeat ed or not. As a result, repetitiv e resources appear in the laboratories of  colleges and universities, which  also constitutes a serious was te of resources, which will make students  and teachers unable to use the la boratory to improve the qualit y of learning [6].  2.4 Single teaching management content  Some colleges and universities in China have misunderstood the function of the laboratory and think  that the main function of the laboratory is to provide assistan ce for teaching. Therefore, when arranging  the use mechanism of the laboratory, the needs of students will  be given priority. In theory, this kind of  thinking fully respects the students and can improve the qualit y of learning. But in fact, it is the teaching  staff who can play a more important role in the laboratory. Tea ching staff often bear the dual  responsibility of teaching and scientific research at the same time. When the content of laboratory
responsibility of teaching and scientific research at the same time. When the content of laboratory  management in Colleges and universities is single, only for stu dents, ignoring the construction needs of  teachers and professors, it will inevitably reduce the enthusia sm of teachers and professors to participate  in scientific research, and then reduce the overall quality of teaching service. In addition, some colleges  and universities do not use the laboratory with an open mind, o nly in a short period of time. Although it  ensures the health quality of the laboratory and the maintenanc e quality of the equipment, it also reduces  the efficiency of the study and research work.  3. Methods and Countermeasures  3.1 Renew ideas and optimize management system  The University side must stand in the national development, the  social development,  the university need,  the teacher need, the student n eeds to carry on the foresight p onder at the same time, renews the idea in  the laboratory management. We should realize that laboratory co nstruction is related to the quality of  running a university, and it is also an important condition for  the future society to develop towards the  core technology mode. Based on this , the management system of l aboratory management can be  optimized from two aspects. First of all, we should build an ac tive laboratory management mode. Keep  the mode of providing experimental projects before the semester , but also set 2-3 opportunities to  construct new experiments. In order to fully respect and use ne w ideas, strive to make every potential  scientific research project can achieve excellent results. Seco ndly, it is necessary to establish the related  methods of responsibility system. Firstly, according to the spe cific laboratory work content and work  requirements, the management pos t should be re planned, and the  post appointment should be selected  according to the best to avoid the phenomenon of personnel redu ndancy.
should be selected  according to the best to avoid the phenomenon of personnel redu ndancy. Each post should be clearly  divided into responsibilities, and there should be no overlap o r blank. The school should regularly check  the quality of laboratory manage ment, and the corresponding man agers should be fully responsible for  the unqualified parts. Thus, the old system of laboratory manag ement can be fully respected and the new  system can be implemented quickly.  3.2 Reconstruct the construction rules and improve the utilization rate of equipment and funds  The university needs to reconstruct the rules of laboratory con struction and use the application forms of  equipment and other resources submitted by each department spon taneously. However, colleges and  universities need to examine the application content of each de partment at the macro level, and ensure
ICAMME 2020 Journal of Physics: Conference Series 1798 (2021) 012006IOP Publishing doi:10.1088/1742-6596/1798/1/012006 4          that the equipment can be used s imultaneously for multiple depa rtments as far as possible, so as to avoid  the waste of resources such as repeated purchase. After complet ing the purchase and laboratory  construction, it is necessary to c onstruct the "intelligent man agement" mode combined with modern  computer technology. That is, the use and management of laborat ory internal equipment and resources  are completed by information technology equipment. The electric al equipment and equipment in the  laboratory adopt the Internet of  things management mode to impr ove the convenience and  professionalism of laboratory management as much as possible. B efore the beginning of each semester,  laboratory managers should scientifically arrange the use rules  and order according to the use needs of  different departments. To ensure that each department can balan ce the use of laboratory resources, the  use of professional equipment to achieve theoretical expectatio ns.  3.3 Open management of laborator ies in Colleges and Universities  With the promotion of curriculum reform policy in China's colle ges and universities in recent years, the  confirmatory experiments in laboratories have been changed into  designed experimental courses, and  all kinds of simple experiments have also been changed into com prehensive experiments. The  arrangement of the traditional teaching experiment course is gr adually reduced. Nowadays, the use time  of laboratories in many colleges and universities is gradually extended, and the laboratories are basically  open all day. In this way, students can have enough time to ver ify the knowledge they learn in the  classroom and meet the requirements of students for experiments  as much as possible. In addition, there  are a lot of them nowadays Students' Graduation Theses need to be verified by the experiments done
are a lot of them nowadays Students' Graduation Theses need to be verified by the experiments done in  the laboratory, so the laboratory should also be open to the gr aduating students, so as to cultivate the  students' experimental spirit and help them get the results as soon as possible. The main purpose of  opening laboratory in Colleges and universities is to create a personalized learning environment for  students. There are many forms of open methods and contents. St udents can make their own choices  according to their own  needs, of course, the y can also carry ou t electronic invention, and so on, so as to  stimulate students' creative enthusiasm. When opening the labor atory, we should also strengthen the  management of the laboratory, set up a special laboratory direc tor and instructor, and register the users  of the laboratory in time before the experiment, so as to facil itate the responsibility to the person, and  also facilitate the supervision an d management of the laborator y and the inspection and maintenance of  the equipment after the experiment.  3.4 Strengthen the construction of laboratory team  To improve the professional quality of laboratory staff, labora tory management refers to the  comprehensive management of peopl e, materials, finance, etc. in  the laboratory, the core content of  management is the management of laboratory personnel. Most of t he laboratories in Colleges and  universities are mainly technical personnel. Their professional  quality is directly related to the  management and construction of the laboratory, which is also re lated to the utilization rate of instruments  and equipment. The laboratory team with high quality can improv e the experimental level of students  more efficiently and create more  high-quality scientific resear ch results for the University. The team of  laboratory can be divided into management team and science teac hing team. The former is mainly  responsible for the daily mainten ance of
team and science teac hing team. The former is mainly  responsible for the daily mainten ance of laboratory equipment a nd facilities, storage work and  preparation before the experiment. The latter is mainly respons ible for the experimental teaching and  the development of related scientific research results. Therefo re, it is necessary to comprehensively  improve the teaching staff of co lleges and universities, improv e the working quality of relevant staff,  build experimental teaching staff, conduct comprehensive traini ng for experimental personnel, enhance  welfare benefits, and create a contingent of teachers with stro ng ability and high technical level.  3.5 building network information platform  The advantages of building an online information platform: stud ents can understand the specific content  of teaching experiment, watch the experimental video, understan d the specific operation process and  precautions of the experiment in advance, and understand the sp ecific use of experimental equipment.
ICAMME 2020 Journal of Physics: Conference Series 1798 (2021) 012006IOP Publishing doi:10.1088/1742-6596/1798/1/012006 5          In this way, students' interest in learning can be improved and  students' autonomous learning ability can  be cultivated. It is very helpful to create a relatively good e xperimental and teaching environment. At  the same time, it can better avoid wasting a lot of time due to  the lack of corresponding experimental  experience, which greatly improv es the teaching efficiency. In addition, teachers can guide students to  learn and correct assignments on the basis of the online platfo rm.  4. Conclusion   The management and construction of  laboratories in Colleges and  universities is a very comprehensive  and systematic work, which requires the perfect combination of funding, team building, planning and  management system, so as to achie ve the comprehensive training objectives of talents. In addition, we  should appropriately strengthen the openness of the laboratory,  integrate and reconstruct the scattered  laboratories in all aspects, implement and optimize the managem ent system, and actively implement it.  At the same time, we should increase the investment in advanced  equipment and talents in the laboratory,  but we should not blindly invest in it. The investment of large  amount of funds must pass the examination  and approval of relevant leaders, the fund management team of t he construction project needs to make  a reasonable and scientific analysis of the fund in and out of the laboratory, so as to ensure the orderly  use, scientific research and teaching of the laboratory. Theref ore, we must constantly strengthen the  management and construction of the  laboratory to create a new s ituation of laboratory work  References  [1] Zhang Jin, Mao Chuanzhong.

After complet ing the purchase and laboratory  construction, it is necessary to c onstruct the "intelligent man agement" mode combined with modern  computer technology. That is, the use and management of laborat ory internal equipment and resources  are completed by information technology equipment. The electric al equipment and equipment in the  laboratory adopt the Internet of  things management mode to impr ove the convenience and  professionalism of laboratory management as much as possible. B efore the beginning of each semester,  laboratory managers should scientifically arrange the use rules  and order according to the use needs of  different departments. To ensure that each department can balan ce the use of laboratory resources, the  use of professional equipment to achieve theoretical expectatio ns.  3.3 Open management of laborator ies in Colleges and Universities  With the promotion of curriculum reform policy in China's colle ges and universities in recent years, the  confirmatory experiments in laboratories have been changed into  designed experimental courses, and  all kinds of simple experiments have also been changed into com prehensive experiments. The  arrangement of the traditional teaching experiment course is gr adually reduced. Nowadays, the use time  of laboratories in many colleges and universities is gradually extended, and the laboratories are basically  open all day. In this way, students can have enough time to ver ify the knowledge they learn in the  classroom and meet the requirements of students for experiments  as much as possible. In addition, there  are a lot of them nowadays Students' Graduation Theses need to be verified by the experiments done
are a lot of them nowadays Students' Graduation Theses need to be verified by the experiments done in  the laboratory, so the laboratory should also be open to the gr aduating students, so as to cultivate the  students' experimental spirit and help them get the results as soon as possible. The main purpose of  opening laboratory in Colleges and universities is to create a personalized learning environment for  students. There are many forms of open methods and contents. St udents can make their own choices  according to their own  needs, of course, the y can also carry ou t electronic invention, and so on, so as to  stimulate students' creative enthusiasm. When opening the labor atory, we should also strengthen the  management of the laboratory, set up a special laboratory direc tor and instructor, and register the users  of the laboratory in time before the experiment, so as to facil itate the responsibility to the person, and  also facilitate the supervision an d management of the laborator y and the inspection and maintenance of  the equipment after the experiment.  3.4 Strengthen the construction of laboratory team  To improve the professional quality of laboratory staff, labora tory management refers to the  comprehensive management of peopl e, materials, finance, etc. in  the laboratory, the core content of  management is the management of laboratory personnel. Most of t he laboratories in Colleges and  universities are mainly technical personnel. Their professional  quality is directly related to the  management and construction of the laboratory, which is also re lated to the utilization rate of instruments  and equipment. The laboratory team with high quality can improv e the experimental level of students  more efficiently and create more  high-quality scientific resear ch results for the University. The team of  laboratory can be divided into management team and science teac hing team. The former is mainly  responsible for the daily mainten ance of
team and science teac hing team. The former is mainly  responsible for the daily mainten ance of laboratory equipment a nd facilities, storage work and  preparation before the experiment. The latter is mainly respons ible for the experimental teaching and  the development of related scientific research results. Therefo re, it is necessary to comprehensively  improve the teaching staff of co lleges and universities, improv e the working quality of relevant staff,  build experimental teaching staff, conduct comprehensive traini ng for experimental personnel, enhance  welfare benefits, and create a contingent of teachers with stro ng ability and high technical level.  3.5 building network information platform  The advantages of building an online information platform: stud ents can understand the specific content  of teaching experiment, watch the experimental video, understan d the specific operation process and  precautions of the experiment in advance, and understand the sp ecific use of experimental equipment.

It is very helpful to create a relatively good e xperimental and teaching environment. At  the same time, it can better avoid wasting a lot of time due to  the lack of corresponding experimental  experience, which greatly improv es the teaching efficiency. In addition, teachers can guide students to  learn and correct assignments on the basis of the online platfo rm.  4. Conclusion   The management and construction of  laboratories in Colleges and  universities is a very comprehensive  and systematic work, which requires the perfect combination of funding, team building, planning and  management system, so as to achie ve the comprehensive training objectives of talents. In addition, we  should appropriately strengthen the openness of the laboratory,  integrate and reconstruct the scattered  laboratories in all aspects, implement and optimize the managem ent system, and actively implement it.  At the same time, we should increase the investment in advanced  equipment and talents in the laboratory,  but we should not blindly invest in it. The investment of large  amount of funds must pass the examination  and approval of relevant leaders, the fund management team of t he construction project needs to make  a reasonable and scientific analysis of the fund in and out of the laboratory, so as to ensure the orderly  use, scientific research and teaching of the laboratory. Theref ore, we must constantly strengthen the  management and construction of the  laboratory to create a new s ituation of laboratory work  References  [1] Zhang Jin, Mao Chuanzhong.
