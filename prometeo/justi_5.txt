What actually works to enhance graduate employability? The relative value of curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular learning and paid work Denise Jackson1&Ruth Bridgstock2 #Springer Nature B.V. 2020 Abstract The focus on short-term graduate employment metrics has catalysed the employability agenda as a strategic directive in universities. A raft of embedded, co-curricular, andextra-curricular activities has emerged for developing employability. Their relative valuelacks empirical exploration. This study explored graduates ’self-reported participation in, and their perspectives on the value of, a range of embedded, extra-curricular, and co- curricular learning activities, as well as paid work, for employability. Survey data were gathered ( N= 510) from Business and Creative Industries graduates from three Australian universities about the perceived value of activities for skill development, gaining relevantexperience, networking, and creating employment opportunities. The activities wereconsidered more useful for gaining experience and skills than for broadening networksand improving career outcomes. Embedded and extra-curricular internships, as well asextra-curricular activities, were believed to be important for enhancing employability.Internships organised as an extra-curricular activity rated better than those delivered as work-integrated learning.

As the higher education (HE) sector has become increasingly competitive, there has been a growing focus on graduate employment outcomes as a way of gauging institutional quality andstudents ’return on investing in degree studies (Blackmore et al. 2016). This has highlighted employability as a strategic directive (Smith et al. 2018), with league tables encompassing employment outcomes, and government funding for HE being made contingent upon graduateoutcome performance, such as with the teaching excellence framework in the UK andperformance-based funding f or universities in Australia (for example, Australian Government 2019). Aligning to the human capital perspective, where developing skills and knowledge will heighten an individual ’s economic value and therefore enhance their career prospects (Becker 1964), national HE policies link superior professional capabilities with enhanced employment outcomes. Rightly or wrongly, universities are now tasked with developing these, acquiring responsibility for fostering student employability. There is, how- ever, not always a positive relationship between student capabilities and graduate employment(Burke et al. 2017). This can be mediated by individual characteristics, such as social and cultural capital (Clarke 2017) and job seeking behaviours and flexibility (Guilbert et al. 2016), and external factors, including recruitment bias, location, and labour market demand (Guilbertet al. 2016;H o r v e r a ke ta l . 2013). In this study, we consider employability to be a multi-dimensional, lifelong, and life-wide phenomenon that is malleable and driven by the individual, yet encouraged and facilitated by HE. We acknowledge debate on the purpose of HE and concerns for vocationalisation arising from the discourse of employability (Smith et al. 2018). We also understand there are some influences beyond the control of educational input yet believe many determining factors ofstudent employability have clear implications for HE
input yet believe many determining factors ofstudent employability have clear implications for HE learning and teaching practice anddelivering pedagogy and opportunities that enhance employability is therefore vital. As thestrategic importance of employability grows, so does the pressure on academics, learningdesigners, and career specialists to facilitate effective interventions through embedded, co-curricular, and extra-curricular pathways. Embedded employability-related activities are those integrated into curricula as a formal component of students ’learning and may form part of their assessment. Co-curricular activities are facilitated by the university yet sit outside thestudents ’formal course of study, often designed and delivered by central services, such as careers provision. Extra-curricular activities are organised externally, undertaken by studentswith no formal involvement from their university, other than perhaps advertising theopportunity. Numerous embedded, co-curricular, and extra-curricular activities (ECAs) for devel- oping employability continue to emerge (Smith et al. 2018 ). Despite the wealth of literature on employability, there appears to be little empirical exploration of their relative value, including how this varies a mong diverse student cohorts. This study examined graduate perspectives on the value of these different activities, as well as paid work, in developing key employability indica tors, namely skill development, gaining relevant experience, broadening of networks, and the creation of employment opportu-nities. The research objectives were to (i) examine how self-reported participation in arange of learning activities and paid work varies by individual characteristics, (ii) explorethe perceived relative value of a range of lea rning activities for enhancing employability, and (iii) examine the role of certain activ ity design characteristics and individual variables on their perceived value for enhan cing employability.

student employability, followed by methodol ogy, presentation of results, and implica- tions for stakeholders responsible for c urricular and co-curricular design. Background Gauging impact on student employability Despite the wealth of studies showcasing and evaluating activities and assessments to augment employability, very few appear to contrast and compare their relative impact. One exception isKinash et al. ’(2016) useful review of strategies designed to enhance employability from the perspective of educators, employers, students, and graduates. These included capstone initiatives, mentoring programs, international exchanges, professional association and othernetworking events, social media networks, volunteering, and work experience. There is alsocommentary from Cranmer ( 2006) who questioned the value of campus-based programs for developing professional skills, although acknowledging the value of industry involvement indesign and delivery. The overall lack of empirical assessment of the relative value-add ofemployability-focused interventions is surprising given the strategic importance of employ-ability and the context of institutional resource constraints. Comparing different activities requires the identification of key indicators of employability. Adopting an instrumental approach, one could gauge the extent to which the learning activitiescreate employment opportunities. This is often achieved through national surveys which usenarrow, short-term measures of graduate employment (Jackson and Bridgstock 2018), more indicative of transition-to-work than labour market achievements (Wilton 2012). Misalignment in the relationship between employability and employment outcomes means investing in adegree does not always ‘pay off ’in employment terms (Burke et al. 2017;W i l t o n 2012)a n d individuals and their attending institutions may not always see the immediate returns on investing significantly in quality curricula designed to enhance student
the immediate returns on investing significantly in quality curricula designed to enhance student employability. Burke and colleagues argue employability is ‘represented in simplistic terms as an objective labour market outcome rather than a complex problem featuring a number of different actors ’(p. 115) and certainly gauging the effectiveness of learning activities should be complemented by othermeasures. Given the favouring of the human capital lens, another commonly explored indicator of employability is discipline-based and professional skill development (the latter also referred toas transferable, generic, non-technical, or ‘soft’skills). Reservations have been expressed (Holmes 2013 )o nH E ’s ability to successfully develop students ’skills in areas such as communication, teamwork, critical thinking, and problem-solving, given the differencesbetween campus and professional settings. The strategic push for enhancing employabilityhas, however, seen rapid growth in embedded, within-subject material, core modules, andexternal programs dedicated to skill development, as well as co-curricular awards usingportfolios and other sophisticated software for students to evidence and articulate theirdevelopment and demonstration of these skills (Smith et al. 2018). Numerous reports list changes in future required capabilities and resulting skill gaps due to digitalisation and automation (for example, AIG 2018; Bakhshi et al. 2017). Despite the theoretical framing of employability broadening to other dimensions, professional skill outcomes remain a keyindicator of student employability. Forms of measurement often include self-report skill auditsand portfolios at different time points during degree studies (for example, Oliver 2013).725 Higher Education (2021) 81:723–739
A further indicator of employability is the ability to interact meaningfully with profes- sionals and establish and effectively leverage networks for the purposes of realising careergoals (Bridgstock and Tippett 2019). The importance of students broadening their networks and refining their networking capabilities is increasingly recognised as critical to their em- ployability. Well-developed professional social networks afford direct access to career oppor-tunities and resources (Batistic and Tymon 2017). Professional networking can also enhance students ’cultural capital, developing their understanding of values, conduct, and behaviours appropriate to professional life (Fugate et al. 2004), and can aid career identity development by enabling students to experience, visualise, and discuss career pathways (Bridgstock 2019). Bridgstock asserts that gauging networking capabilities and the extent of networks is relativelyunderexplored and lacking in empirical examination. Finally, there is strong evidence that students both desire and expect meaningful exposure to industry during their studies to enhance their preparedness for work and aid career prospects(Tymon 2013). They favour practical components that connect them with employers, exposing them to current practice and enabling them to visualise and apply their theoretical learningbeyond the classroom setting (Jackson 2019). Tymon found that students are eager to gain relevant work experience, particularly international students who often select their country ofeducation based on such opportunities (Cturtle and Decision Lab 2019). Employers also value applied learning activities, particularly internships (Hart Research Associates 2018), and work experience has become a highly regarded selection criterion among graduate employers (NACE 2018). Although evaluating student participation in activities that provide relevant experience may not be difficult, deciphering their relative benefit can pose challenges giventhe
experience may not be difficult, deciphering their relative benefit can pose challenges giventhe complexities associated with defining and gauging individual learning gain with respect toemployability (Williams et al. 2016), and the sector ’s tendency to focus on employment proxy measures. Activities to enhance student employability Work-integrated learning (WIL) is one pathway for enhancing HE student employability andhas attracted increasing attention in Australia, catalysed by its National Strategy (UniversitiesAustralia et al. 2015). It refers to embedding learning activities and assessment that involves students in meaningful industry and/or co mmunity engagement, encompassing both workplace-based activities (placements, practicums, and internships) and virtual or campus-based activities (client projects, industry panels, consultancies, start-up/incubators, virtualplacements, and mentoring programs). The latter are of particular interest given the difficulties in scaling up workplace-based WIL where student demand for work experience often outstrips available employer opportunities (Universities Australia 2019). WIL provides a key platform for employers and HE to collaborate on developing future talent to meet industry needs andclose apparent skill gaps, such as teamwork, analytical reasoning, and problem-solving(Bloomberg 2018). Institutions have invested significantly in WIL, perceiving it to be positively associated with student employability. In turn, there has been increasing pressure to evaluate the‘employment value ’of its various forms. Typically, there has been more attention to gauging the impact of workplace-based WIL (for example, McCarthy and Swayn 2019;N g h i aa n d Duyen 2019) than emerging, virtual/campus-based models. With respect to the four employ- ability indicators utilised in this study, there is a documented positive effect on both discipline-specific and professional skill outcomes (Deeley 2014; Jackson 2015), enabling students to726

visualise and practice applying skills in authentic settings. Second, it provides a unique opportunity for students to expand their networks and facilitates purposive interaction withrole model professionals through assigned tasks and projects (Gibson 2004). Third, it provides a clear pathway for gaining relevant experience through the completion of authentic work and application of theoretical knowledge. The employment effect is, however, less clear. Severalstudies have detected a positive relationship (Jackson and Collings 2018;M c C a r t h ya n d Swayn 2019; Silva et al. 2018) while earlier research reported no effect at all (Kinash et al. 2016;W i l t o n 2012). There has been a growing focus on universities introducing co-curricular activities intended to enhance employability and create positional advantage for its graduating students (Bergerand Wild 2017 ; Green et al. 2019 ). Examples include leadership and award programs, community engagement/outreach activities, competitions and hackathons, volunteering hubs, and student clubs/societies. In addition to WIL and co-curricular activities, paid work and arange of ECAs are widely considered to enhance our four indicators of student employability.First, ECAs enhance student self-confidence, self-awareness, and student capability in a widerange of professional skills (Clark et al. 2015;M u l d o o n 2009). Clark and colleagues also found paid work particularly useful for enhancing communication and interpersonal skillswhile Coates ( 2015) reported its benefits for both discipline and professional skills-based learning. Both voluntary and paid work are considered to aid the development of networks among students (Coates 2015;M u l d o o n 2009). The value of ECAs and paid work for gaining relevant experience is perhaps less clear, determined by the nature of the activity, with whom and in what context. Some, for example,have expressed caution on the value of paid work not relevant to degree studies (Gracia 2010;
expressed caution on the value of paid work not relevant to degree studies (Gracia 2010; Kinash et al. 2016). There is some evidence that paid work and ECAs improve employment prospects (JJackson and Collings 2018;P u r c e l le ta l . 2012) although concerns have been raised for a negative effect on academic performance due to balancing time commitments(Hordósy et al. 2018;T h o m p s o ne ta l . 2013). Clark et al. ( 2015) reported that ECAs aided students ’during recruitment and selection processes due to enhanced self-confidence and the signalling of certain capabilities to potential employers. Many have emphasised the importanceof encouraging students to consider their ECAs, work, and university-based learning activitiesin complement, requiring deep reflection on the meaning and value of achievements acrosstheir different activities (Clark et al. 2015; Thompson et al. 2013). Method Participants The study ’s participants comprised 510 graduates of undergraduate programs (Business = 279, Creative Industries = 194, double degree = 37) who graduated in 2013 (one to two yearspreviously at the time of the survey, N= 242) or in 2016 (four to five years previously at the time of the survey, N= 268). Data were gathered on Creative Industries and Business graduates as it was anticipated these would capture contrasting curricular activities with respect to student employability, given their varying labour market contexts. Data were collected from graduates of three universities located in different States (university 1 = 101, university 2 =131, university 3 = 278). None is classified as research-intensive and each has a reputation forquality learning and teaching, particularly in relation to advancing student employability.

summary of participants ’characteristics is presented in Table 1. Consistent with HE student enrolments, approximately two-thirds of the graduates were female and significant proportionwere aged below 34 years. The high proportion of domestic graduates was expected, given the study was conducted up to five years post-course completion and many international students would no longer be in Australia. There were more Business graduate participants at both timeperiods. Procedures Eligible graduates —those that had graduated between 2013 and 2016 in Business or Creative Industries undergraduate programs —were invited to participate in an online survey by email, their contact details obtained via their respective university ’s alumni database. Two reminder emails were sent, an incentive was offered for survey completion, and responses were gatheredbetween October 2017 and March 2018. Measures In addition to background characteristics, the survey comprised questions on participation inuniversity learning activities, ECAs, and paid work. Respondents were presented with a list of learning activities, collapsed into the categories of for-credit, not-for-credit, co-curricular, and paid work. They were asked to indicate their engagement in each, whether it was paid (or part-paid), its relevance to their degree, and the approximate number of hours and weeks they wereengaged in the activity. They were also asked to rate the extent to which they interactedmeaningfully with professionals from their field of interest during the learning activity.

Outcome variables Graduates were asked to rate how useful they believed each learning activity was for (a) learning new skills, (b) gaining experience relevant to their desired career, (c) broadening their networks, and (d) creating employment opportunities. These four outcome variables wereselected as established indicators of student employability, as discussed in the backgroundreview. All ratings were completed on a 5-point Likert scale with a neutral point. Predictor variables First, students provided detail on their background characteristics (see Table 1). The second group of predictor variables were the characteristics of the activity, paid versus unpaid, extent of participation (duration), relevance of participation, and the extent of meaningful interactionwith professionals during the activity. These were selected given studies documenting differ-ences for pay (McHugh 2017) and duration (Jackson and Wilton 2017), and the perceived importance of authenticity and relevance in quality WIL (Smith 2012). Analysis Survey data were aggregated and analysed using SPSS 24.0. To address the first research objective, variations in self-reported participation across different activities were examined byindividual characteristics using non-parametric tests, Mann-Whitney Utests for comparing two independent groups, and Kruskal-Wallis tests for three or more. A Bonferroni correctionwas not applied, given the exploratory nature of the study. Variations by discipline wereexamined only for the major groups of Business and Creative Industries, given the smallnumber who completed a degree in both ( N= 37). To address the second research objective, the mean ratings, and associated standard deviations, were computed for the perceived usefulness of the learning activities and the extent to which they interacted with professionals. Furthermore, a composite mean was created for each type of learning activity to indicate theirperceived value on average. The third research objective
type of learning activity to indicate theirperceived value on average. The third research objective was explored using multiple linear regression which was conducted to gauge the predictive value, if any, of activity design variables (duration,relevance to degree, pay, and extent of interaction with professionals), institution, and disci-pline on the composite employability indicator for for-credit internship/practicum/placementsat the employer ’s place of work. This learning activity was selected due to sample size, ensuring it met Harrell ’s(2001) widely used recommendation of a minimum 10 subjects-per- variable. Results Participation in learning activities Table 2indicates that almost 60% of the sample reported they had participated in one or more of the for-credit learning activities as part of their studies. Most popular were internships/practicums/placements at the employers ’place of work, followed by industry-based projects/ consultancies, and internship/practicum/placement at their own university. Almost one-half of729 Higher Education (2021) 81:723–739
the sample participated in one or more of the not-for-credit learning activities with, again, the greatest proportion undertaking an industry-based internship. Far smaller proportions partici-pated in mentoring, project/consultancies, or an internship at their own university. Only 14.4% of all graduates participated in a co-curricular activity, spanning leadership programs, com- munity engagement/outreach, competitions, volunteering, and student clubs/societies. Inter-estingly, only 17.3% had participated in paid work relevant to their career during their studies. Mann-Whitney tests ( α= .05) showed a variation in participation by gender for only for- credit internships at an employer ’s place of work with relatively more females taking part, U= 15983 ( Z=−2.721), p= .007. Regarding status at enrolment, significantly more school leavers participated in not-for-credit internships/placements/practicums at their own university,U=1 8 8 5 9( Z=−2.516), p= .012. There were also reported differences for those that were first-in-family to attend university. Significantly more graduates whose family members before them had attended university had participated in for-credit internships/placements/practicums,U=1 7 3 1 0( Z=−3.380), p= .001, and not-for-credit internships, U=1 8 6 3 8 . 5 0( Z=−2.392), p= .017, both at the employer ’s place of work. Further, relatively more graduates who were first-in-family to attend university participated in co-curricular activities, U= 19010 ( Z=− 2.243), p=. 0 2 5 . There were some recorded differences by residency with more international students participating in not-for-credit internships/placements/practicums at their own university, U= 10832.5 ( Z=−1.987), p= .047, and relatively more domestic students participating in co- curricular activities, U= 10433 ( Z=−2.078), p= .038.

There were no reported differences byprofessional status prior to completing a degree. Perceived value of learning activities The mean ratings for the learning activities for each of the four employability indicators, andtheir associated standard deviations, are presented in Table 3. The means for activities with participation of greater than 20 graduates are presented in Fig. 1. Results indicated that for- credit, enterprise/incubation/start-up activities were considered the most useful, on average, forall four employability indicators although only six graduates participated in this activity. Interestingly, the same activity, but in not-for-credit format, was rated one of the least useful across the average and all four indicators. Not-for-credit internships —both university- and industry-based —were highly regarded, achieving a consistently high mean relative to other activities on all four indicators. Paid workalso rated well, although was perceived as relatively less useful for broadening networks.There were consistently positive ratings for for-credit internships at the employer ’s place of work. Embedded internships at the graduate ’s own university did not rate as well, particularly for broadening networks and creating employment opportunities. For-credit, remote/virtual placements/study tours were also considered valuable, particular- ly for broadening networks but relatively less so for creating employment opportunities.Interestingly, the equivalent not-for-credit activity attracted relatively lower ratings apart fromfor creating employment opportunities.

mean ratings for broadening networks. Overall, the relative value of not-for-credit versus for- credit activities appeared broadly equal in terms of average ratings. Predictors of the perceived value of learning activities Before building the regression model, the normality of the outcome variables was explored.Measures of kurtosis and skew were well within accepted ranges of 7 and 2 respectively(Curran et al. 1996). The selected base variables are denoted by 0 in Table 1. For pay, the base variable was ‘no pay ’. The first institution, with the smallest sample size, was the assigned base variable and the shortest length of time (less than 100 h) was the base variable forduration. There were no bivariate correlations greater than 0.6, alleviating risk for type II errors (Grewal et al. 2004). Computed variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance were well within the accepted limits of ± 2 (George and Mallery 2010), suggesting multicollinearity was not present. There was no evidence of first-order linear auto-correlation given the Durbin-Watsontest statistic was 2.007 and therefore close to the critical value of two (Norusis 2008). The results of the ordinary least-squares regression are presented in Table 4.A d j u s t e d R 2of .315 indicated reasonable model fit and the model was significant, F(9, 92) = 6.156, p<. 0 0 0 . Results indicated that Creative Industries graduates rated the usefulness of internships/ practicums/placements as significantly lower than Business graduates. The extent to which the activity enabled individuals to interact meaningfully with professionals had a positive influ- ence on the learning activity ’s perceived value for enhancing employability. Similarly, the internship ’s relevance to the individual ’s degree positively predicted its perceived value for augmenting employability. Discussion and implications Embedded learning activities were perceived as broadly useful to graduates ’skill develop- ment, gaining of relevant experience,
were perceived as broadly useful to graduates ’skill develop- ment, gaining of relevant experience, provision of networking opportunities, and employmentprospects, although in varying ways. This might suggest that engaging in a variety of activitieswould be useful for students over time. The lack of dazzling results for the learning activities ’ perceived value for creating employment opportunities accentuates the rather tenuous Table 4 Regression analysis —perceived value of for-credit-internship for employability Variable B SE β pvalue Constant 1.087 0.505 .034 Paid 0.094 0.363 0.022 .796Part-paid 0.339 0.294 0.102 .253 Interaction with professionals 0.323 0.087 0.328 .000** Relevance to degree 0.366 0.101 0.313 .000** Length (100 –299 h) 0.183 0.2 0.093 .363 Length (300+ h) 0.464 0.264 0.179 .082 Institution two 0.249 0.223 0.12 .268 Institution three −0.395 0.282 −0.146 .164 Creative Industries −0.43 0.177 −0.211 .017* R 2 .376 Adjusted R2 .315 *p< .05, ** p<. 0 1733 Higher Education (2021) 81:723–739
relationship between employability interventions and employment outcomes, despite the common misconception that employability and employment are one and the same (Pegget al. 2012). That employability activities are not always reported to lead to improved career outcomes is a disappointing reality for both institutions and individual graduates, given their time-consuming and resource-intensive nature. In line with extant literature (Bridgstock andTippett 2019), the reported effects of learning activities on providing meaningful opportunities to interact with professionals were also somewhat disappointing, signalling the need foreducators to embed deeper industry engagement into such learning activities. The high level of participation reported for embedded internships reflects the spike in less traditional disciplines (such as Education and Nursing) as a means of creating positionaladvantage, particularly in non-professionally accredited contexts. Participation by compara- tively fewer first-in-family graduates could be attributed to commonly imposed academic entry criterion which inhibits students with lower grades from participating in WIL (Dunn et al.2016), often of lower socio-economic status (Peach et al. 2012). Relaxing such restrictive criterion and instead focusing on the demonstration of work ethic when recruitment into WILis important for more equitable access (Jackson 2018). Participation in ECAs could align to strategically trying to create positional advantage (Roulin and Bangerter 2013 ), as well as growing interest in social responsibility among millennial students (Deloitte 2018 ). Findings reflect the heightened popularity of extra- curricular internships (Interns Australia 2015). The fewer first-in-family students undertaking embedded and extra-curricular internships may be attributed to relatively less access tofinancial support and greater paid work commitments (Purcell et al. 2012), demonstrating how ECAs can perpetuate further disadvantage
work commitments (Purcell et al. 2012), demonstrating how ECAs can perpetuate further disadvantage (Hordósy and Clark 2018 ). The higher incidence of school leavers, international and younger students participating in extra-curricular internships at their own university could indicate their limited attractiveness toexternal employers, who have been observed to favour domestic students (Gribble 2014). As these activities appear highly valuable for enhancing employability, continued facilitation of these activities by HE providers —and employing strategies to also attract first-in-family students —may prove powerful for cohorts who need to develop their limited social capital. Both embedded and not-for-credit internships were highly regarded for gaining experience and developing skills, aligning with previous studies (Jackson 2015). Previously reported positive effects of internships on employment outcomes (Brooks and Youngson 2016)w e r e evident more for extra-curricular than embedded formats. Across-the-board superior ratings fornot-for-credit internships support Irwin, Nordmann, and Simms ’(2019) findings yet appear counter-intuitive given the absence of academic control and monitoring of mentoring/super- vision, feedback, and specification of learning outcomes, all integral to quality embedded internships (Smith 2012). Supremacy over for-credit offerings could reflect specific university arrangements or may evidence dissonance about participating in embedded WIL as a sacrificefor the academic knowledge they could gain in discipline-focused units. The relative benefitsof being based with an external employer versus at university were mixed. Findings broadly suggest the need to review embedded internships in Creative Industries to ensure their intended benefits are being realised. This, however, may not fit within thetraditional internship model given these graduates are more likely to be self-employed or working in micro-businesses, need strong social networks to
are more likely to be self-employed or working in micro-businesses, need strong social networks to move from project to project, are more likely to work in firms outside their specialisms (such as a graphic designer in agovernment department) and in multi-disciplinary project groups, and are likely to be verychallenged in initial attempts in finding relevant work and establishing a career (see Bridgstock734 Higher Education (2021) 81:723–739
and Cunningham 2016;C o l l i s 2010). In this context, WIL may simply need to be different for Creative Industries students. Traditional internship models often may not fit either the stu-dent’s learning needs or the configurations and activities of Creative Industries employers, particularly in terms of supervisory arrangements which can be highly problematic for smaller businesses (Jackson et al. 2016). Findings illuminate the need to consider how WIL can be designed to facilitate meaningful interaction with professionals, particularly in virtual contexts using mediums such as Zoom orSkype. Further, findings echo previous studies which assert how close alignment between WILand the students ’course content will enhance learning outcomes, enabling them to apply theoretical knowledge (Smith 2012), and providing insight into their career of interest (Jackson 2019). That the length of the activity made no difference to perceived value for enhancing employability aligns with Irwin et al. ( 2019), although Jackson and Wilton ( 2017)f o u n d lengthier internships created more value for career development learning. Pay is unimportantto the value of the activity, contradicting McHugh ( 2017) who found a positive relationship between compensation and the developmental value of internships. Indeed one might expectpay would assure a better workplace experience given industry ’s commitment and therefore greater intent on providing meaningful and challenging work, critical to WIL. Unpaid activ-ities raise concerns for equity, often perceived as a barrier for certain student groups to accessWIL (Moore et al. 2015 ). McHugh asserts a lack of empirical exploration in this area, highlighting the need for further analysis. The relatively low participation in co-curricular activities may largely be due to timing with award programs gaining significant traction very recently. Although their perceived value forenhancing employability is not overly evident in this study, the high
their perceived value forenhancing employability is not overly evident in this study, the high profile and resourcing ofco-curricular award programs may produce different results in coming years and their impor-tance for broadening networks means encouraging the participation of students with weakersocial and cultural capital is particularly important. The relatively greater take-up by first-in-family students could perhaps indicate a conscious awareness of the need to create positional advantage in the labour market. The lower than expected undertaking of relevant paid work could be discipline-related where access in certain business fields —Accounting, Human Resource Management and Finance —may be limited until course completion. Findings confirm the value of paid work for enhancing employability (Muldoon 2009) in several ways, prompting educators (and parents) to encourage students to seek relevant employment duringuniversity years. As noted by Goldfinch and Hughes ( 2007), the true value of part-time work is more likely to be harnessed with deep reflection, again emphasising the need for educators toencourage students to consider ECAs, work, and university-based learning activities in complement through portfolios or other reflective tools. The apparent usefulness for embedded remote/virtual placements/study tours is positive given that rise in home-based working (Global Workplace Analytics 2017). The equivalent not-for-credit activities were relatively poorly rated may confirm the value of qualitymentoring, supervision, and feedback that s hould be integral to for-credit activities (McHugh 2017). Although only undertaken by a handful of graduates, the broad benefits of for-credit enterprise incubation/start-ups were apparent and warrant close consideration byeducators responsible for enhancing student employability. There is significant interest in for-credit projects/consultancies/industry panels as a means of achieving scale in WIL (Kay et al. 2018). That
projects/consultancies/industry panels as a means of achieving scale in WIL (Kay et al. 2018). That Business graduates are relatively less active in projects/consultancies may reflect their infant engagement with WIL that is not workplace-based, compared with Creative Industries graduates who can be better versed in such735 Higher Education (2021) 81:723–739
arrangements (Collis 2010). Further growth across disciplines is likely given the impetus for WIL and reliance on such emerging models to accommodate larger student numbers andovercome certain barriers to participation associated with traditional WIL. Results, however, indicate caution regarding their ability to enhance all aspects of employability and close attention is required to ensure their design attracts the benefits inherent to traditional WIL.Finally, mentoring —particularly as an extra-curricular arrangement —appears valuable for broadening networks and —to a lesser degree —creating employment opportunities. Educators may wish to encourage student participation by facilitating mentoring arrangements withalumni and other industry partners. Conclusion Embedded learning activities were perceived as broadly useful for skill development, gainingrelevant experience and networking, in varying ways. Activities did not, however, report toalways lead to improved career outcomes and their perceived relative lack of impact onnetworking opportunities prompts further review given the strong links between social capitaland employment. Internships and extra-curricular activities were considered important forenhancing employability yet differing participation among student groups emphasises the value of universities embedding or at least facilitating activities in ways that cater for all students. Findings also affirm the apparent value of paid, relevant work for improving careeroutcomes, highlighting the important role of universities as brokers of job opportunities. Thispaper makes an important contribution to pedagogy and curricular design for enhancingemployability among HE students. It provides valuable insight into the perceived relativevalue of ECAs, paid work, co-curricular programs, and WIL for enhancing employabilityamong diverse student groups. Thus, it contributes to a sorely needed empirical evidence basefor the plethora of employability strategies that exist
to a sorely needed empirical evidence basefor the plethora of employability strategies that exist and are often deployed based on ‘what should work ’. As students, institutions and governments are all investing far more in employ- ability as a key desired outcome, studies that demonstrate the impact of different kinds oflearning activities on employability from varying perspectives and with diverse cohorts areessential. With respect to limitations, the study relied on self-report data from a single source which may be considered problematic (Podsakoff et al. 2003). These data were, however, considered most appropriate given the focus on perceived relative value of different learning activities andwere gathered from three different institutions. It is also noted that there could be potential bias when rating the relevance of learning activities, being positive outcome activities may be more likely perceived as more relevant. Finally, the sample size inhibited a deeper exploration of therelatively value of a greater range of learning activities using multivariate techniques. Theresearch highlights some key areas for future research, such as exploring whether self-sourcingtheir own activity was a determining factor in graduate perceptions of the relative value of not-for-credit versus embedded internships for the purposes of enhancing employability. Further,examining the valuable features of enterprise, start-up, and incubator activities for a greatersample would enhance our understanding of their importance, particularly in a graduate labour market where many will need to create their own employment.

The relative value of curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular learning and paid work Denise Jackson1&Ruth Bridgstock2 #Springer Nature B.V. 2020 Abstract The focus on short-term graduate employment metrics has catalysed the employability agenda as a strategic directive in universities. A raft of embedded, co-curricular, andextra-curricular activities has emerged for developing employability. Their relative valuelacks empirical exploration. This study explored graduates ’self-reported participation in, and their perspectives on the value of, a range of embedded, extra-curricular, and co- curricular learning activities, as well as paid work, for employability. Survey data were gathered ( N= 510) from Business and Creative Industries graduates from three Australian universities about the perceived value of activities for skill development, gaining relevantexperience, networking, and creating employment opportunities. The activities wereconsidered more useful for gaining experience and skills than for broadening networksand improving career outcomes. Embedded and extra-curricular internships, as well asextra-curricular activities, were believed to be important for enhancing employability.Internships organised as an extra-curricular activity rated better than those delivered as work-integrated learning. Implications for stakeholders responsible for curricular and co- curricular design are discussed. Keywords Experientiallearning .Work-integratedlearning .Skillsdevelopment .Employability .

As the higher education (HE) sector has become increasingly competitive, there has been a growing focus on graduate employment outcomes as a way of gauging institutional quality andstudents ’return on investing in degree studies (Blackmore et al. 2016). This has highlighted employability as a strategic directive (Smith et al. 2018), with league tables encompassing employment outcomes, and government funding for HE being made contingent upon graduateoutcome performance, such as with the teaching excellence framework in the UK andperformance-based funding f or universities in Australia (for example, Australian Government 2019). Aligning to the human capital perspective, where developing skills and knowledge will heighten an individual ’s economic value and therefore enhance their career prospects (Becker 1964), national HE policies link superior professional capabilities with enhanced employment outcomes. Rightly or wrongly, universities are now tasked with developing these, acquiring responsibility for fostering student employability. There is, how- ever, not always a positive relationship between student capabilities and graduate employment(Burke et al. 2017). This can be mediated by individual characteristics, such as social and cultural capital (Clarke 2017) and job seeking behaviours and flexibility (Guilbert et al. 2016), and external factors, including recruitment bias, location, and labour market demand (Guilbertet al. 2016;H o r v e r a ke ta l . 2013). In this study, we consider employability to be a multi-dimensional, lifelong, and life-wide phenomenon that is malleable and driven by the individual, yet encouraged and facilitated by HE. We acknowledge debate on the purpose of HE and concerns for vocationalisation arising from the discourse of employability (Smith et al. 2018). We also understand there are some influences beyond the control of educational input yet believe many determining factors ofstudent employability have clear implications for HE --- the immediate returns on investing significantly in quality curricula designed to enhance student employability. Burke and colleagues argue employability is ‘represented in simplistic terms as an objective labour market outcome rather than a complex problem featuring a number of different actors ’(p. 115) and certainly gauging the effectiveness of learning activities should be complemented by othermeasures. Given the favouring of the human capital lens, another commonly explored indicator of employability is discipline-based and professional skill development (the latter also referred toas transferable, generic, non-technical, or ‘soft’skills). Reservations have been expressed (Holmes 2013 )o nH E ’s ability to successfully develop students ’skills in areas such as communication, teamwork, critical thinking, and problem-solving, given the differencesbetween campus and professional settings. The strategic push for enhancing employabilityhas, however, seen rapid growth in embedded, within-subject material, core modules, andexternal programs dedicated to skill development, as well as co-curricular awards usingportfolios and other sophisticated software for students to evidence and articulate theirdevelopment and demonstration of these skills (Smith et al. 2018). Numerous reports list changes in future required capabilities and resulting skill gaps due to digitalisation and automation (for example, AIG 2018; Bakhshi et al. 2017). Despite the theoretical framing of employability broadening to other dimensions, professional skill outcomes remain a keyindicator of student employability. Forms of measurement often include self-report skill auditsand portfolios at different time points during degree studies (for example, Oliver 2013).725 Higher Education (2021) 81:723–739
input yet believe many determining factors ofstudent employability have clear implications for HE learning and teaching practice anddelivering pedagogy and opportunities that enhance employability is therefore vital. As thestrategic importance of employability grows, so does the pressure on academics, learningdesigners, and career specialists to facilitate effective interventions through embedded, co-curricular, and extra-curricular pathways. Embedded employability-related activities are those integrated into curricula as a formal component of students ’learning and may form part of their assessment. Co-curricular activities are facilitated by the university yet sit outside thestudents ’formal course of study, often designed and delivered by central services, such as careers provision. Extra-curricular activities are organised externally, undertaken by studentswith no formal involvement from their university, other than perhaps advertising theopportunity. Numerous embedded, co-curricular, and extra-curricular activities (ECAs) for devel- oping employability continue to emerge (Smith et al. 2018 ). Despite the wealth of literature on employability, there appears to be little empirical exploration of their relative value, including how this varies a mong diverse student cohorts. This study examined graduate perspectives on the value of these different activities, as well as paid work, in developing key employability indica tors, namely skill development, gaining relevant experience, broadening of networks, and the creation of employment opportu-nities. The research objectives were to (i) examine how self-reported participation in arange of learning activities and paid work varies by individual characteristics, (ii) explorethe perceived relative value of a range of lea rning activities for enhancing employability, and (iii) examine the role of certain activ ity design characteristics and individual variables on their perceived value for enhan cing employability.

student employability, followed by methodol ogy, presentation of results, and implica- tions for stakeholders responsible for c urricular and co-curricular design. Background Gauging impact on student employability Despite the wealth of studies showcasing and evaluating activities and assessments to augment employability, very few appear to contrast and compare their relative impact. One exception isKinash et al. ’(2016) useful review of strategies designed to enhance employability from the perspective of educators, employers, students, and graduates. These included capstone initiatives, mentoring programs, international exchanges, professional association and othernetworking events, social media networks, volunteering, and work experience. There is alsocommentary from Cranmer ( 2006) who questioned the value of campus-based programs for developing professional skills, although acknowledging the value of industry involvement indesign and delivery. The overall lack of empirical assessment of the relative value-add ofemployability-focused interventions is surprising given the strategic importance of employ-ability and the context of institutional resource constraints. Comparing different activities requires the identification of key indicators of employability. Adopting an instrumental approach, one could gauge the extent to which the learning activitiescreate employment opportunities. This is often achieved through national surveys which usenarrow, short-term measures of graduate employment (Jackson and Bridgstock 2018), more indicative of transition-to-work than labour market achievements (Wilton 2012). Misalignment in the relationship between employability and employment outcomes means investing in adegree does not always ‘pay off ’in employment terms (Burke et al. 2017;W i l t o n 2012)a n d individuals and their attending institutions may not always see the immediate returns on investing significantly in quality curricula designed to enhance student --- A further indicator of employability is the ability to interact meaningfully with profes- sionals and establish and effectively leverage networks for the purposes of realising careergoals (Bridgstock and Tippett 2019). The importance of students broadening their networks and refining their networking capabilities is increasingly recognised as critical to their em- ployability. Well-developed professional social networks afford direct access to career oppor-tunities and resources (Batistic and Tymon 2017). Professional networking can also enhance students ’cultural capital, developing their understanding of values, conduct, and behaviours appropriate to professional life (Fugate et al. 2004), and can aid career identity development by enabling students to experience, visualise, and discuss career pathways (Bridgstock 2019). Bridgstock asserts that gauging networking capabilities and the extent of networks is relativelyunderexplored and lacking in empirical examination. Finally, there is strong evidence that students both desire and expect meaningful exposure to industry during their studies to enhance their preparedness for work and aid career prospects(Tymon 2013). They favour practical components that connect them with employers, exposing them to current practice and enabling them to visualise and apply their theoretical learningbeyond the classroom setting (Jackson 2019). Tymon found that students are eager to gain relevant work experience, particularly international students who often select their country ofeducation based on such opportunities (Cturtle and Decision Lab 2019). Employers also value applied learning activities, particularly internships (Hart Research Associates 2018), and work experience has become a highly regarded selection criterion among graduate employers (NACE 2018). Although evaluating student participation in activities that provide relevant experience may not be difficult, deciphering their relative benefit can pose challenges giventhe
experience may not be difficult, deciphering their relative benefit can pose challenges giventhe complexities associated with defining and gauging individual learning gain with respect toemployability (Williams et al. 2016), and the sector ’s tendency to focus on employment proxy measures. Activities to enhance student employability Work-integrated learning (WIL) is one pathway for enhancing HE student employability andhas attracted increasing attention in Australia, catalysed by its National Strategy (UniversitiesAustralia et al. 2015). It refers to embedding learning activities and assessment that involves students in meaningful industry and/or co mmunity engagement, encompassing both workplace-based activities (placements, practicums, and internships) and virtual or campus-based activities (client projects, industry panels, consultancies, start-up/incubators, virtualplacements, and mentoring programs). The latter are of particular interest given the difficulties in scaling up workplace-based WIL where student demand for work experience often outstrips available employer opportunities (Universities Australia 2019). WIL provides a key platform for employers and HE to collaborate on developing future talent to meet industry needs andclose apparent skill gaps, such as teamwork, analytical reasoning, and problem-solving(Bloomberg 2018). Institutions have invested significantly in WIL, perceiving it to be positively associated with student employability. In turn, there has been increasing pressure to evaluate the‘employment value ’of its various forms. Typically, there has been more attention to gauging the impact of workplace-based WIL (for example, McCarthy and Swayn 2019;N g h i aa n d Duyen 2019) than emerging, virtual/campus-based models. With respect to the four employ- ability indicators utilised in this study, there is a documented positive effect on both discipline-specific and professional skill outcomes (Deeley 2014; Jackson 2015), enabling students to726

visualise and practice applying skills in authentic settings. Second, it provides a unique opportunity for students to expand their networks and facilitates purposive interaction withrole model professionals through assigned tasks and projects (Gibson 2004). Third, it provides a clear pathway for gaining relevant experience through the completion of authentic work and application of theoretical knowledge. The employment effect is, however, less clear. Severalstudies have detected a positive relationship (Jackson and Collings 2018;M c C a r t h ya n d Swayn 2019; Silva et al. 2018) while earlier research reported no effect at all (Kinash et al. 2016;W i l t o n 2012). There has been a growing focus on universities introducing co-curricular activities intended to enhance employability and create positional advantage for its graduating students (Bergerand Wild 2017 ; Green et al. 2019 ). Examples include leadership and award programs, community engagement/outreach activities, competitions and hackathons, volunteering hubs, and student clubs/societies. In addition to WIL and co-curricular activities, paid work and arange of ECAs are widely considered to enhance our four indicators of student employability.First, ECAs enhance student self-confidence, self-awareness, and student capability in a widerange of professional skills (Clark et al. 2015;M u l d o o n 2009). Clark and colleagues also found paid work particularly useful for enhancing communication and interpersonal skillswhile Coates ( 2015) reported its benefits for both discipline and professional skills-based learning. Both voluntary and paid work are considered to aid the development of networks among students (Coates 2015;M u l d o o n 2009). The value of ECAs and paid work for gaining relevant experience is perhaps less clear, determined by the nature of the activity, with whom and in what context. Some, for example,have expressed caution on the value of paid work not relevant to degree studies (Gracia 2010;
expressed caution on the value of paid work not relevant to degree studies (Gracia 2010; Kinash et al. 2016). There is some evidence that paid work and ECAs improve employment prospects (JJackson and Collings 2018;P u r c e l le ta l . 2012) although concerns have been raised for a negative effect on academic performance due to balancing time commitments(Hordósy et al. 2018;T h o m p s o ne ta l . 2013). Clark et al. ( 2015) reported that ECAs aided students ’during recruitment and selection processes due to enhanced self-confidence and the signalling of certain capabilities to potential employers. Many have emphasised the importanceof encouraging students to consider their ECAs, work, and university-based learning activitiesin complement, requiring deep reflection on the meaning and value of achievements acrosstheir different activities (Clark et al. 2015; Thompson et al. 2013). Method Participants The study ’s participants comprised 510 graduates of undergraduate programs (Business = 279, Creative Industries = 194, double degree = 37) who graduated in 2013 (one to two yearspreviously at the time of the survey, N= 242) or in 2016 (four to five years previously at the time of the survey, N= 268). Data were gathered on Creative Industries and Business graduates as it was anticipated these would capture contrasting curricular activities with respect to student employability, given their varying labour market contexts. Data were collected from graduates of three universities located in different States (university 1 = 101, university 2 =131, university 3 = 278). None is classified as research-intensive and each has a reputation forquality learning and teaching, particularly in relation to advancing student employability.

summary of participants ’characteristics is presented in Table 1. Consistent with HE student enrolments, approximately two-thirds of the graduates were female and significant proportionwere aged below 34 years. The high proportion of domestic graduates was expected, given the study was conducted up to five years post-course completion and many international students would no longer be in Australia. There were more Business graduate participants at both timeperiods. Procedures Eligible graduates —those that had graduated between 2013 and 2016 in Business or Creative Industries undergraduate programs —were invited to participate in an online survey by email, their contact details obtained via their respective university ’s alumni database. Two reminder emails were sent, an incentive was offered for survey completion, and responses were gatheredbetween October 2017 and March 2018. Measures In addition to background characteristics, the survey comprised questions on participation inuniversity learning activities, ECAs, and paid work. Respondents were presented with a list of learning activities, collapsed into the categories of for-credit, not-for-credit, co-curricular, and paid work. They were asked to indicate their engagement in each, whether it was paid (or part-paid), its relevance to their degree, and the approximate number of hours and weeks they wereengaged in the activity. They were also asked to rate the extent to which they interactedmeaningfully with professionals from their field of interest during the learning activity.

Outcome variables Graduates were asked to rate how useful they believed each learning activity was for (a) learning new skills, (b) gaining experience relevant to their desired career, (c) broadening their networks, and (d) creating employment opportunities. These four outcome variables wereselected as established indicators of student employability, as discussed in the backgroundreview. All ratings were completed on a 5-point Likert scale with a neutral point. Predictor variables First, students provided detail on their background characteristics (see Table 1). The second group of predictor variables were the characteristics of the activity, paid versus unpaid, extent of participation (duration), relevance of participation, and the extent of meaningful interactionwith professionals during the activity. These were selected given studies documenting differ-ences for pay (McHugh 2017) and duration (Jackson and Wilton 2017), and the perceived importance of authenticity and relevance in quality WIL (Smith 2012). Analysis Survey data were aggregated and analysed using SPSS 24.0. To address the first research objective, variations in self-reported participation across different activities were examined byindividual characteristics using non-parametric tests, Mann-Whitney Utests for comparing two independent groups, and Kruskal-Wallis tests for three or more. A Bonferroni correctionwas not applied, given the exploratory nature of the study. Variations by discipline wereexamined only for the major groups of Business and Creative Industries, given the smallnumber who completed a degree in both ( N= 37). To address the second research objective, the mean ratings, and associated standard deviations, were computed for the perceived usefulness of the learning activities and the extent to which they interacted with professionals. Furthermore, a composite mean was created for each type of learning activity to indicate theirperceived value on average. The third research objective
type of learning activity to indicate theirperceived value on average. The third research objective was explored using multiple linear regression which was conducted to gauge the predictive value, if any, of activity design variables (duration,relevance to degree, pay, and extent of interaction with professionals), institution, and disci-pline on the composite employability indicator for for-credit internship/practicum/placementsat the employer ’s place of work. This learning activity was selected due to sample size, ensuring it met Harrell ’s(2001) widely used recommendation of a minimum 10 subjects-per- variable. Results Participation in learning activities Table 2indicates that almost 60% of the sample reported they had participated in one or more of the for-credit learning activities as part of their studies. Most popular were internships/practicums/placements at the employers ’place of work, followed by industry-based projects/ consultancies, and internship/practicum/placement at their own university. Almost one-half of729 Higher Education (2021) 81:723–739
the sample participated in one or more of the not-for-credit learning activities with, again, the greatest proportion undertaking an industry-based internship. Far smaller proportions partici-pated in mentoring, project/consultancies, or an internship at their own university. Only 14.4% of all graduates participated in a co-curricular activity, spanning leadership programs, com- munity engagement/outreach, competitions, volunteering, and student clubs/societies. Inter-estingly, only 17.3% had participated in paid work relevant to their career during their studies. Mann-Whitney tests ( α= .05) showed a variation in participation by gender for only for- credit internships at an employer ’s place of work with relatively more females taking part, U= 15983 ( Z=−2.721), p= .007. Regarding status at enrolment, significantly more school leavers participated in not-for-credit internships/placements/practicums at their own university,U=1 8 8 5 9( Z=−2.516), p= .012. There were also reported differences for those that were first-in-family to attend university. Significantly more graduates whose family members before them had attended university had participated in for-credit internships/placements/practicums,U=1 7 3 1 0( Z=−3.380), p= .001, and not-for-credit internships, U=1 8 6 3 8 . 5 0( Z=−2.392), p= .017, both at the employer ’s place of work. Further, relatively more graduates who were first-in-family to attend university participated in co-curricular activities, U= 19010 ( Z=− 2.243), p=. 0 2 5 . There were some recorded differences by residency with more international students participating in not-for-credit internships/placements/practicums at their own university, U= 10832.5 ( Z=−1.987), p= .047, and relatively more domestic students participating in co- curricular activities, U= 10433 ( Z=−2.078), p= .038.

There were no reported differences byprofessional status prior to completing a degree. Perceived value of learning activities The mean ratings for the learning activities for each of the four employability indicators, andtheir associated standard deviations, are presented in Table 3. The means for activities with participation of greater than 20 graduates are presented in Fig. 1. Results indicated that for- credit, enterprise/incubation/start-up activities were considered the most useful, on average, forall four employability indicators although only six graduates participated in this activity. Interestingly, the same activity, but in not-for-credit format, was rated one of the least useful across the average and all four indicators. Not-for-credit internships —both university- and industry-based —were highly regarded, achieving a consistently high mean relative to other activities on all four indicators. Paid workalso rated well, although was perceived as relatively less useful for broadening networks.There were consistently positive ratings for for-credit internships at the employer ’s place of work. Embedded internships at the graduate ’s own university did not rate as well, particularly for broadening networks and creating employment opportunities. For-credit, remote/virtual placements/study tours were also considered valuable, particular- ly for broadening networks but relatively less so for creating employment opportunities.Interestingly, the equivalent not-for-credit activity attracted relatively lower ratings apart fromfor creating employment opportunities. --- were perceived as broadly useful to graduates ’skill develop- ment, gaining of relevant experience, provision of networking opportunities, and employmentprospects, although in varying ways. This might suggest that engaging in a variety of activitieswould be useful for students over time. The lack of dazzling results for the learning activities ’ perceived value for creating employment opportunities accentuates the rather tenuous Table 4 Regression analysis —perceived value of for-credit-internship for employability Variable B SE β pvalue Constant 1.087 0.505 .034 Paid 0.094 0.363 0.022 .796Part-paid 0.339 0.294 0.102 .253 Interaction with professionals 0.323 0.087 0.328 .000** Relevance to degree 0.366 0.101 0.313 .000** Length (100 –299 h) 0.183 0.2 0.093 .363 Length (300+ h) 0.464 0.264 0.179 .082 Institution two 0.249 0.223 0.12 .268 Institution three −0.395 0.282 −0.146 .164 Creative Industries −0.43 0.177 −0.211 .017* R 2 .376 Adjusted R2 .315 *p< .05, ** p<. 0 1733 Higher Education (2021) 81:723–739

mean ratings for broadening networks. Overall, the relative value of not-for-credit versus for- credit activities appeared broadly equal in terms of average ratings. Predictors of the perceived value of learning activities Before building the regression model, the normality of the outcome variables was explored.Measures of kurtosis and skew were well within accepted ranges of 7 and 2 respectively(Curran et al. 1996). The selected base variables are denoted by 0 in Table 1. For pay, the base variable was ‘no pay ’. The first institution, with the smallest sample size, was the assigned base variable and the shortest length of time (less than 100 h) was the base variable forduration. There were no bivariate correlations greater than 0.6, alleviating risk for type II errors (Grewal et al. 2004). Computed variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance were well within the accepted limits of ± 2 (George and Mallery 2010), suggesting multicollinearity was not present. There was no evidence of first-order linear auto-correlation given the Durbin-Watsontest statistic was 2.007 and therefore close to the critical value of two (Norusis 2008). The results of the ordinary least-squares regression are presented in Table 4.A d j u s t e d R 2of .315 indicated reasonable model fit and the model was significant, F(9, 92) = 6.156, p<. 0 0 0 . Results indicated that Creative Industries graduates rated the usefulness of internships/ practicums/placements as significantly lower than Business graduates. The extent to which the activity enabled individuals to interact meaningfully with professionals had a positive influ- ence on the learning activity ’s perceived value for enhancing employability. Similarly, the internship ’s relevance to the individual ’s degree positively predicted its perceived value for augmenting employability. Discussion and implications Embedded learning activities were perceived as broadly useful to graduates ’skill develop- ment, gaining of relevant experience,
relationship between employability interventions and employment outcomes, despite the common misconception that employability and employment are one and the same (Pegget al. 2012). That employability activities are not always reported to lead to improved career outcomes is a disappointing reality for both institutions and individual graduates, given their time-consuming and resource-intensive nature. In line with extant literature (Bridgstock andTippett 2019), the reported effects of learning activities on providing meaningful opportunities to interact with professionals were also somewhat disappointing, signalling the need foreducators to embed deeper industry engagement into such learning activities. The high level of participation reported for embedded internships reflects the spike in less traditional disciplines (such as Education and Nursing) as a means of creating positionaladvantage, particularly in non-professionally accredited contexts. Participation by compara- tively fewer first-in-family graduates could be attributed to commonly imposed academic entry criterion which inhibits students with lower grades from participating in WIL (Dunn et al.2016), often of lower socio-economic status (Peach et al. 2012). Relaxing such restrictive criterion and instead focusing on the demonstration of work ethic when recruitment into WILis important for more equitable access (Jackson 2018). Participation in ECAs could align to strategically trying to create positional advantage (Roulin and Bangerter 2013 ), as well as growing interest in social responsibility among millennial students (Deloitte 2018 ). Findings reflect the heightened popularity of extra- curricular internships (Interns Australia 2015). The fewer first-in-family students undertaking embedded and extra-curricular internships may be attributed to relatively less access tofinancial support and greater paid work commitments (Purcell et al. 2012), demonstrating how ECAs can perpetuate further disadvantage
work commitments (Purcell et al. 2012), demonstrating how ECAs can perpetuate further disadvantage (Hordósy and Clark 2018 ). The higher incidence of school leavers, international and younger students participating in extra-curricular internships at their own university could indicate their limited attractiveness toexternal employers, who have been observed to favour domestic students (Gribble 2014). As these activities appear highly valuable for enhancing employability, continued facilitation of these activities by HE providers —and employing strategies to also attract first-in-family students —may prove powerful for cohorts who need to develop their limited social capital. Both embedded and not-for-credit internships were highly regarded for gaining experience and developing skills, aligning with previous studies (Jackson 2015). Previously reported positive effects of internships on employment outcomes (Brooks and Youngson 2016)w e r e evident more for extra-curricular than embedded formats. Across-the-board superior ratings fornot-for-credit internships support Irwin, Nordmann, and Simms ’(2019) findings yet appear counter-intuitive given the absence of academic control and monitoring of mentoring/super- vision, feedback, and specification of learning outcomes, all integral to quality embedded internships (Smith 2012). Supremacy over for-credit offerings could reflect specific university arrangements or may evidence dissonance about participating in embedded WIL as a sacrificefor the academic knowledge they could gain in discipline-focused units. The relative benefitsof being based with an external employer versus at university were mixed. Findings broadly suggest the need to review embedded internships in Creative Industries to ensure their intended benefits are being realised. This, however, may not fit within thetraditional internship model given these graduates are more likely to be self-employed or working in micro-businesses, need strong social networks to
are more likely to be self-employed or working in micro-businesses, need strong social networks to move from project to project, are more likely to work in firms outside their specialisms (such as a graphic designer in agovernment department) and in multi-disciplinary project groups, and are likely to be verychallenged in initial attempts in finding relevant work and establishing a career (see Bridgstock734 Higher Education (2021) 81:723–739
and Cunningham 2016;C o l l i s 2010). In this context, WIL may simply need to be different for Creative Industries students. Traditional internship models often may not fit either the stu-dent’s learning needs or the configurations and activities of Creative Industries employers, particularly in terms of supervisory arrangements which can be highly problematic for smaller businesses (Jackson et al. 2016). Findings illuminate the need to consider how WIL can be designed to facilitate meaningful interaction with professionals, particularly in virtual contexts using mediums such as Zoom orSkype. Further, findings echo previous studies which assert how close alignment between WILand the students ’course content will enhance learning outcomes, enabling them to apply theoretical knowledge (Smith 2012), and providing insight into their career of interest (Jackson 2019). That the length of the activity made no difference to perceived value for enhancing employability aligns with Irwin et al. ( 2019), although Jackson and Wilton ( 2017)f o u n d lengthier internships created more value for career development learning. Pay is unimportantto the value of the activity, contradicting McHugh ( 2017) who found a positive relationship between compensation and the developmental value of internships. Indeed one might expectpay would assure a better workplace experience given industry ’s commitment and therefore greater intent on providing meaningful and challenging work, critical to WIL. Unpaid activ-ities raise concerns for equity, often perceived as a barrier for certain student groups to accessWIL (Moore et al. 2015 ). McHugh asserts a lack of empirical exploration in this area, highlighting the need for further analysis. The relatively low participation in co-curricular activities may largely be due to timing with award programs gaining significant traction very recently. Although their perceived value forenhancing employability is not overly evident in this study, the high --- projects/consultancies/industry panels as a means of achieving scale in WIL (Kay et al. 2018). That Business graduates are relatively less active in projects/consultancies may reflect their infant engagement with WIL that is not workplace-based, compared with Creative Industries graduates who can be better versed in such735 Higher Education (2021) 81:723–739
their perceived value forenhancing employability is not overly evident in this study, the high profile and resourcing ofco-curricular award programs may produce different results in coming years and their impor-tance for broadening networks means encouraging the participation of students with weakersocial and cultural capital is particularly important. The relatively greater take-up by first-in-family students could perhaps indicate a conscious awareness of the need to create positional advantage in the labour market. The lower than expected undertaking of relevant paid work could be discipline-related where access in certain business fields —Accounting, Human Resource Management and Finance —may be limited until course completion. Findings confirm the value of paid work for enhancing employability (Muldoon 2009) in several ways, prompting educators (and parents) to encourage students to seek relevant employment duringuniversity years. As noted by Goldfinch and Hughes ( 2007), the true value of part-time work is more likely to be harnessed with deep reflection, again emphasising the need for educators toencourage students to consider ECAs, work, and university-based learning activities in complement through portfolios or other reflective tools. The apparent usefulness for embedded remote/virtual placements/study tours is positive given that rise in home-based working (Global Workplace Analytics 2017). The equivalent not-for-credit activities were relatively poorly rated may confirm the value of qualitymentoring, supervision, and feedback that s hould be integral to for-credit activities (McHugh 2017). Although only undertaken by a handful of graduates, the broad benefits of for-credit enterprise incubation/start-ups were apparent and warrant close consideration byeducators responsible for enhancing student employability. There is significant interest in for-credit projects/consultancies/industry panels as a means of achieving scale in WIL (Kay et al. 2018). That
arrangements (Collis 2010). Further growth across disciplines is likely given the impetus for WIL and reliance on such emerging models to accommodate larger student numbers andovercome certain barriers to participation associated with traditional WIL. Results, however, indicate caution regarding their ability to enhance all aspects of employability and close attention is required to ensure their design attracts the benefits inherent to traditional WIL.Finally, mentoring —particularly as an extra-curricular arrangement —appears valuable for broadening networks and —to a lesser degree —creating employment opportunities. Educators may wish to encourage student participation by facilitating mentoring arrangements withalumni and other industry partners. Conclusion Embedded learning activities were perceived as broadly useful for skill development, gainingrelevant experience and networking, in varying ways. Activities did not, however, report toalways lead to improved career outcomes and their perceived relative lack of impact onnetworking opportunities prompts further review given the strong links between social capitaland employment. Internships and extra-curricular activities were considered important forenhancing employability yet differing participation among student groups emphasises the value of universities embedding or at least facilitating activities in ways that cater for all students. Findings also affirm the apparent value of paid, relevant work for improving careeroutcomes, highlighting the important role of universities as brokers of job opportunities. Thispaper makes an important contribution to pedagogy and curricular design for enhancingemployability among HE students. It provides valuable insight into the perceived relativevalue of ECAs, paid work, co-curricular programs, and WIL for enhancing employabilityamong diverse student groups. Thus, it contributes to a sorely needed empirical evidence basefor the plethora of employability strategies that exist
to a sorely needed empirical evidence basefor the plethora of employability strategies that exist and are often deployed based on ‘what should work ’. As students, institutions and governments are all investing far more in employ- ability as a key desired outcome, studies that demonstrate the impact of different kinds oflearning activities on employability from varying perspectives and with diverse cohorts areessential. With respect to limitations, the study relied on self-report data from a single source which may be considered problematic (Podsakoff et al. 2003). These data were, however, considered most appropriate given the focus on perceived relative value of different learning activities andwere gathered from three different institutions. It is also noted that there could be potential bias when rating the relevance of learning activities, being positive outcome activities may be more likely perceived as more relevant. Finally, the sample size inhibited a deeper exploration of therelatively value of a greater range of learning activities using multivariate techniques. Theresearch highlights some key areas for future research, such as exploring whether self-sourcingtheir own activity was a determining factor in graduate perceptions of the relative value of not-for-credit versus embedded internships for the purposes of enhancing employability. Further,examining the valuable features of enterprise, start-up, and incubator activities for a greatersample would enhance our understanding of their importance, particularly in a graduate labour market where many will need to create their own employment.

El artículo "What actually works to enhance graduate employability? The relative value of curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular learning and paid work" de Denise Jackson y Ruth Bridgstock, publicado en 2020, examina la creciente importancia de la empleabilidad de los graduados en el contexto universitario. Este enfoque ha llevado a las instituciones educativas a implementar diversas actividades con el objetivo de mejorar las oportunidades laborales de sus egresados, aunque la efectividad relativa de estas actividades en el desarrollo de la empleabilidad no ha sido suficientemente investigada.

### Metodología del Estudio
El estudio se basa en la participación autoinformada de 510 graduados de las áreas de Negocios y Industrias Creativas de tres universidades australianas. A través de encuestas, los graduados evaluaron la utilidad de diferentes actividades en términos de desarrollo de habilidades, adquisición de experiencia relevante, creación de redes y oportunidades de empleo. Se identificaron tres tipos de actividades: curriculares (integradas en el currículo), co-curriculares (facilitadas por la universidad pero no parte del curso formal) y extracurriculares (organizadas externamente).

### Resultados Clave
Los resultados revelan que las actividades se consideran más efectivas para la obtención de experiencia y habilidades que para la ampliación de redes profesionales o la mejora de resultados laborales. Las pasantías, tanto las integradas en el currículo como las extracurriculares, se identificaron como cruciales para mejorar la empleabilidad, siendo las extracurriculares valoradas más positivamente. 

### Implicaciones para la Educación Superior
El estudio concluye que los responsables del diseño curricular deben prestar atención a la estructura y naturaleza de las actividades ofrecidas para maximizar su impacto en la empleabilidad de los graduados. Se destaca que la empleabilidad es un fenómeno multidimensional, influenciado por características individuales y factores externos como sesgos en el reclutamiento y demanda del mercado laboral.

### Contexto de la Empleabilidad
El artículo también aborda el contexto más amplio de la educación superior, donde la competencia ha llevado a un enfoque en los resultados de empleo de los graduados como indicador de calidad institucional. Se menciona que las políticas nacionales vinculan capacidades profesionales superiores con mejores resultados de empleo, y que las universidades tienen la responsabilidad de desarrollar estas capacidades.

### Actividades de Aprendizaje
Las actividades de aprendizaje se clasifican en tres categorías:
1. **Actividades integradas**: Parte formal del currículo.
2. **Actividades co-curriculares**: Facilitadas por la universidad, pero no parte del curso formal.
3. **Actividades extracurriculares**: Organizadas externamente y llevadas a cabo por los estudiantes.

### Evaluación de la Empleabilidad
El estudio se centra en cómo la participación en diversas actividades de aprendizaje y trabajo remunerado varía según características individuales y cómo estas actividades influyen en la percepción del valor para mejorar la empleabilidad. Se identifican indicadores clave de empleabilidad, como el desarrollo de habilidades y la creación de oportunidades laborales.

### Conclusiones y Recomendaciones
El texto subraya la necesidad de integrar y evaluar diversas actividades que contribuyan al desarrollo de la empleabilidad en los estudiantes, destacando la falta de investigación empírica sobre su efectividad. Se recomienda que las instituciones educativas implementen metodologías que fomenten el aprendizaje activo y la aplicación práctica de los conocimientos adquiridos.

### Referencias a Estudios Previos
El artículo menciona estudios previos que han explorado la relación entre la educación superior y la empleabilidad, así como la importancia de las actividades extracurriculares y la experiencia laboral en la preparación de los estudiantes para el mercado laboral.

### Consideraciones Finales
El estudio proporciona una visión comprensiva sobre cómo diferentes tipos de actividades de aprendizaje son valoradas por los graduados, destacando la importancia de la relevancia y la interacción profesional en la percepción de su utilidad para la empleabilidad. Se concluye que, aunque las actividades de aprendizaje son valiosas, su efectividad puede variar según el contexto y las características individuales de los estudiantes.
