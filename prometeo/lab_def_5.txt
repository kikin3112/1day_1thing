Experien tial  learning is regarded as a valuable way to link up theoretical knowledge and practical skills in hospitality and tourism educa tion.  Although some studies have addressed the importance of experiential learning, the factors influencing students’ choice o f overseas  exchange programs, and the challenges and benefits of students’ experiential learning are still unclear, especially on the ov erseas  exchange programs. The purpose of this study is to reveal the whole picture of overseas exchange programs by util izing experiential  learning cycle theory, and further understand students’ perce ption of overseas experiential learning . By employing quantitative and  qualitative methods, including questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews with students who have partic ipated in the overseas  exchange programs and content analysis of program information, this study analyzes the differences of factors considered by males   and females  in choosing overseas exchange programs, and  displays  the four-stage  learning process  of exp eriential learning in  overseas exchange programs  and identifies two themes of challenges (living challenges and learning challenges) and five themes of  benefits (cognitive development, behavio ural change, multiple skill development, social bonding developm ent, academic  competitiveness & employability enhancement) for experiential learning for students majoring in Hospitality and Tourism.

enriches our understandings of the experiential learning cycle theory and provides insights to educators in the  design of future  overseas exchange programs.     Keywords:  experiential learning; challenges and benefits; overseas exchange programs; experiential learning cycle theory;  hospitality and tourism education       Introduction   Hospitality and Tourism is an interdisc iplinary subject that requires both theoretical knowledge and  practical skills. Therefore, bridging the gap between theory and practice becomes crucial in hospitality and  tourism education. Experiential learning approaches, such as field trips, role -playin g, overseas studying , and  so on, are considered effective ways to fill up the gap in the field of hospitality and tourism higher education.  Among those approaches, the overseas exchange programs are regarded as an extension of experiential  learning from th e traditional classroom to a further field (Hopkins, 1999), and have become increasingly  popular.  According to the report published by the Institute of International Education (2020), as shown in  Table 1, the number of non -degree international students in the United States has shown an overall growth  trend in the past two decades. International exchanges programs (non -degree) can be divided into five levels  according to the duration: several days to a few weeks; 3 -8 weeks, summer programs; semester; semeste r to  the academic year (this duration includes two levels) (Engle and Engle, 2003). There are obvious differences  in specific learning contents and forms at different levels, including site (enterprise, museum, etc.) visits;  “subject -matter” lectures and c ourse;  target -language course; international class; service -learning course;  work internship, and so on (Coker et al. 2017; Engle and Engle, 2003).  However, in the context of  experiential learning, the studies to identify students’ challenges and benefits in studying abroad programs  are limited. To
studies to identify students’ challenges and benefits in studying abroad programs  are limited. To improve the overall quality of higher education, it is necessary to understand the value of such  challenges and benefits created for students within the scope of humanities.   Kolb (1984) firstly developed the expe riential learning cycle theory, and it has been widely applied in  academic research and higher education practice. Researchers have reached a consensus that learning is a  continuous process grounded in experience (Kolb, 1984; Kolb and Kolb, 2005). And expe riential  learning is  the process of grasping and transforming knowledge to construct meaning from real -world experience (Kolb,  1984; Kolb and Kolb, 2017; Yardley et al., 2012). However, most  existing literature ignored the grasping   process and only paid at tention to the transforming  process  directly when analyzing experiential learning  project s (Yan and Cheung, 20 12). In other words, previous studies focu sed on the gains of experiential  learning for participants but d id not analyze the challenges faced by  participants in experiential learning  program s. More s pecifically, the motivation and decision -making, the benefits and value of this kind of  programs have received much attention (Bretag and van der Veen, 2017), but the questions of how  participants adapt to the new circumstance and how study abroad programs impact participants’ personal                                                              © Chieh Yun Yang, Dengming Xie, Jose Weng Chou Wong. 2021.

Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     80 growth are still under investigation  (Yu and Zhang, 2016) . Therefore, it is important to understand  what  difficulties students face and how they ultimately resolve them.     Table 1. Number of international non -degree students in the United States (1999 -2019)   Data source: Institute of International Education     This study aims to reveal the whole process of overseas experiential learning and explor e the  challenges and benefits of  overseas exchange programs in the field of hospitality and tourism.  Fifteen  students who had experience in such programs were invited to participate in this study. To understand their  motivations and concerns for making decisions before the program, diffi culties, and solutions during the  program, gains after the program, they were asked to answer a series of open -ended questions through the in - depth interview. The contribution of this study is twofold. First, applying experiential learning cycle theory,  this study enriches the literature of grasping and transforming process by identifying students’ challenges and  benefits of study abroad programs. Second, the results of this study provide implications for education  institutions (or program planners) to arra nge experiential learning programs more effectively and give  suggestions for participants (students) to choose appropriate experiential learning programs which are  beneficial for their personal growth.     Literature review   Experiential learning theory   Kolb ( 1984) stated that learning is the process whereby knowledge is created through the  transformation of experience; knowledge results from the combination of grasping and transforming  experience. He further defined experiential learning as the process of gras ping and transforming knowledge  to construct meaning from real -world experience (Kolb, 1984, p.41). Based on Dewey, Lewin, and Piaget’s  learning model, Kolb (1984) analyzed the process of experiential learning
Lewin, and Piaget’s  learning model, Kolb (1984) analyzed the process of experiential learning and developed the experiential  learning cycle theory (Figure 1), which includes four stages: concrete experience (CE), reflective observation  (RO), abstract conceptualization (AC), and active experimentation (AE). These four stages are categorized as  two primary dimensions of the learning process: the  grasping dimension (CE & AC) and the transforming  dimension (RO & AE). This reflects the two ways we learn. The first is how we perceive and grasp new  information or experience, and the second is how we process and transform what we receive (Healey and  Jenkins, 2000).
Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     81 Challenges and benefits of studying abroad   Smith and Khawaja (2011) argued that international students who choose to study abroad might  encounter many challenges, including acculturative stress and adaptation to the host country’s environ ment.  During the period of studying abroad, it is inevitable for international students to encounter a variety of  challenges or difficulties caused by different circumstances (Gong et al., 2020). Based on the acculturation  models, previous studies mentione d that language barriers, educational stressors, sociocultural stressors,  discrimination, lifestyle acculturative stressors, and psychological challenges were the main challenges faced  by international students (Pitts, 2016). For example, Yu and Zhang (201 6) found that mainland Chinese  students in Hong Kong experienced the challenges of language barriers, social interactions, political  identification, and discrimination. Previous studies have recognized various challenges, but the findings  of  these research  mainly relate to programs in the traditional classroom, rather than experiential learning  programs, in which students may encounter different challenges.   Steinberg (2002) pointed out that overseas experiential learning is laudable and creditworthy, and  identified the benefits of overseas experiential learning. For example, overseas experiential programs have  strong academic value for students to gain linguistic skills, intercultural learning abilities, and analytical and  conceptual skills. Numerous studies  suggested that such programs offer a particularly valuable experience  that cannot be substituted. This study agreed with the previous study that students on short -term (1 -8 weeks)  and long -term (typically a semester or longer) study abroad programs do sho w meaningful learning gains in  developing intercultural sensitivity, global perspective, linguistic ability, lifelong friendships with host - country nationals
global perspective, linguistic ability, lifelong friendships with host - country nationals (Coker et al., 2017). Although the benefits of various overseas experiential learning  programs hav e been mentioned in previous studies, the findings may be different and deserve particular  attention in different cultural contexts and different forms of programs.     Method s  Aiming to understand the process and outcomes of overseas experiential learning pr ograms, this study  adopted quantitative and qualitative methods to identify the key elements in whole experiential learning  stages as suggested by Tsaur et al. (2019) . A questionnaire survey with the theme of curriculum opinion  survey was carried out to examine what factors students mainly considered when choosing international  exchange pro gram s. Also, the in-depth interview was conducted to collect data in a way that allowed the  researchers to acquire detailed descriptions from the interviewees (DiCicco -Bloom and Crabtree, 2006).     Study context and data collection   Three overseas experiential learning programs in Macau Universities are involved in this study : New  Zealand Wines Industrial Field Trip Program (13 -days), U.S. International Hospitality & Tourism Academic  Program (3 -weeks), and U.S. Disney Internship Program (6 -months). The questionnaire data were borrowed   from a curriculum opinion survey conducted by the institution with the consent of the students and the  institution.  The data were based on the 7 7 students’ evaluation results of the importance (unimportant and  important) of five consideration  factors (program quality, program fee, previous participant evaluation,  safety, difficulty of application process) in choosing the programs.   The interview da ta collection for this study has three steps: First, after obtaining the permission of the  responsible education institution , the interview  invitations were sent to 77 students who had attend ed one of  the experiential learning
interview  invitations were sent to 77 students who had attend ed one of  the experiential learning programs . The invitation clea rly stated the purpose and the voluntary principle of  the interview and emphasized that all data are used for this research only and will not have any other impact  on the interviewee s. Students who were willing to participate in the interview were informed  that all contents  during the interview would be presented anonymously. Second, the in -depth interviews were conducted face - to-face in their native language . The interview guideline (See Appendix A ) was inspired by previous studies  (Yang et al., 2015) to understand students’ experiences (challenges and benefits) in overseas experiential  learning programs. Finally, the recorded interview transcripts were returned to all interviewees  correspondingly for proofreading the contents. No incentives were provided i n this study. A total of 15  students participated  in the in-depth interview, remarking them N1 to N15. 3 respondents were male, and 12  respondents were female. The number of respondents  in the three programs was 9, 3, and 3, respectively.  Overall, the inte rview took over 60 minutes on average, and the word count for the interview transcripts was  more than 30,000.     Data analysis   First, this study  adopted SPSS 23.0 to perform a Chi-square test on the questionnaire data. Second, the  text data were analyzed by deductive thematic analysis, which is to identify themes from qualitative data and
Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     82 answer the research questions  (Xu et al., 2018). Deductive thematic analysis is a top -down method, which  adopts the predetermined codebook based on literature. The code  label, the definition of themes and, the  descriptions of when the theme occurs are three critical elements involved in compiling the codebook (Xu et  al., 2018). Two researchers in this study strictly followed the coding  steps suggested by Fereday and Muir - Coch rane (2006) and work  independently. Then, the final codes were identified after negotiation.     Results  of the Chi-square test   Table 1 illustrates the results of the Chi -square test. The Chi -square test results show that there are  significant differences bet ween males and females on previous participants’ evaluation and safety. In terms of  the evaluation of the previous participants, p-value=0.000 <0.05, indicating while the most female (78.2%)  think the previous participant’s evaluation is important, male car es less about that ( only 22.7%). Regarding  safety, p-value =0.023 <0.05, indicating that  males and female s have significant differences in it. While most  female (72.7%) takes safety as an important factor to joining the international exchange program, more male  (54.5%) thinks that is not important. Besides, there are no significant  gender differences in students’  evaluation of program quality, program fee, and difficulty of the application pro cess.    Table 1.

The first element of concrete experience includes the experience  of survival context and studying context. In this study, the experience of survival context includes clothing,  food, house, and transportation, and so on. While the experience of  studying context includes seminars,  internships, field trips, role -play, and so on. And the reflection observation from the concrete experience  includes mainly the living and learning challenges. On the other hand, existing studies have shown that  cultura l adaptation is regarded as one of the reasons students feel challenges when studying abroad (Gong et  al., 2020). In response to these challenges, the participants adopted diverse strategic efforts to achieve  personal development in various aspects: cognit ive development, behavio ural change, multiple skill  development, social bonding development, academic competitiveness & employability enhancemen t.
Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     83   Living challenge 1: language -based issues (12 of 15 interviewees addressed)   Language -based issues in overse as exchange programs  include  language barriers and different cultural  expressions. Language barriers happen throughout their daily lives in all areas, such as restaurants,  supermarkets, the library, and travel ling. As N2 mentioned, “ I have passed many Engl ish-related language  exams, such as IELTS. But when I communicate with foreigners in person, some slangs, or expressions they  often use are unfamiliar to me, and they become our big language barriers ”.  As people from different cultural backgrounds may have  big differences in language expression, N4  and N14 expressed their embarrassment when they were praised in front of other students. For example, N4  stated, “ Even if I made a low -level mistake in the day ’s work, my manager would still say to me, ‘You did a   good job today, you worked hard. ’ This makes me feel ashamed, but afterward s, I realized that good is not  good enough. ‘Good’ means 90 points in our country but maybe it means 70 points here ”.   Living challenge 2: social relations (10 of 15 interviewees a ddressed)   When participants are joining the overseas exchange programs , everything around them is new and it  makes some of them feel unfamiliar and difficult to make new friends. Although they need to contact local  people, tourists, colleagues, and other p articipants in their daily life and work, it is still not easy  for students   to establish a friendship with other foreigners . “I am always thinking that people are treating me differently.  Some people are caring for me too much, while some others are neglec ting me . No matter what, I feel like I  am an outsider, and I don’t feel comfortable to make friends under this situation  (N5, N9)” .  Living challenge 3: local food culture (7 of 15 interviewees addressed)   The respondents who participated in the exchange pro gram
(7 of 15 interviewees addressed)   The respondents who participated in the exchange pro gram generally expressed that they had poor  adaptability to the local food culture. Many interviewees (40%) addressed that they tried hard to adapt to the  local food and beverage, but they would get sick or even had negative physical reactions. “ After comi ng here,  I often eat high -calorie foods such as barbecues and hamburgers, and my weight has increased significantly  in two months. There are not many food options here...  (N8)”. Many students (33%)  emphasized the ice  water drinking habit in the U.S., while  Chinese culture prefers warm or boiled water. As N3 said, “ If we eat  too much cold food, our body will become more susceptible to cold or humidity. But every time when I boiled  water in the morning , my American roommates feel strange and surprised. It’ s r eally a cultural shock for  them ”.  Living challenge 4: local customs (Tipping culture) (7 of 15 interviewees addressed)   In some Western countries, tipping is a recognition and thanks to the waitperson’s hard work in a  restaurant or hotel. However, it is not  necessary for Chinese social culture, and half of the participants (50%)  felt not comfortable with the tipping culture, as N7 noted , “When I first started living in the United States, I  don’t have the sense to tip the waiter s. Sometimes, the waiter will t ake the initiative to remind me if I forg et to  tip when I eat in the restaurant or take a taxi. Which made me very embarrassed, and then I gradually got  used to it”.   Living challenge 5: security and health (7 of 15 interviewees addressed)   In recent years, security has also become a big concern in overseas exchange programs. Two female  participants said that for safety reasons, they generally do not walk alone outdoors (N3, N5). In addition, N7
Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     84 said, “ It was more troublesome to see a doctor here. Besides lan guage, we don ’t know the address of the  hospital and the process of medical treatment, so I cannot go to the hospital alone. Sometimes I don’t even  know whom I should ask… ”. Some students (20%) would therefore overlook their health issues, “ The best  soluti on to this question is not to get sick… (N5)”.   Learning challenge 1: academic pressure (13 of 15 interviewees addressed)   A new foreign educational system different from hometown will put academic pressure on international  students . Also, when students get used to traditional classroom teaching, the experiential learning model will  also booster their challenges. Smith and Khawaja (2011) believed that t his problem typically arose  when  international  students attempt to adopt  a new educational environment. In this study, the foreign cultural  background and the form of experiential learning programs are new educational environments for most  students. Therefore, academic pressure was one of the difficulties that participants can hardly avoid. “ We  have English less ons at my home university . In class, I can understand the teacher’ s words and sentences ,  but I can’t understand the teaching logic very well. Instead of going out and writing a report, sometimes I  prefer sitting in the classroom and writing an exam paper a fter the course (N13) ”.  Learning challenge 2: internship difficulties (5 of 15 interviewees addressed)   The difficulties from the internship include their language proficiency, lack of practical working  experiences, and collaboration with colleagues. N7 men tioned that the internship work made her feel  physically and psychologically exhausted. She even considered giving up the internship. N5 shared some  comments, “ During this internship, my mistakes sometimes lead to customer dissatisfaction, and it makes me  very sad. I felt that I was bringing troubles to customers and
dissatisfaction, and it makes me  very sad. I felt that I was bringing troubles to customers and colleagues rather than giving help”.   Benefit  1: cognitive development (13 of 15 interviewees addressed)   Learning is a cognitive development linking  persistent acclimatization with environmental  engagement.  The c ognitive development through overseas experiential learning is mainly reflected in the perception of  oneself (self -awareness and self -understanding), other people (social communication), and other things  (international perspectives, cultu ral and global diversity, racial, ethnic diversity, and complexities of global  issues) (Tian and Lu, 2018). In the present study, respondents’ self -rated improvement appears in self- confidence, open -mindedness, independence, and self-reflection, and actual ization. N6 believe d that she ha s  become braver than before, “ I have met a lot of people during the internship, and they liked me very much.  Now, I am more confident and dare to express my opinions positively ”. N12 was very excited to share with  the interv iewer the changes in his attitude towards life, “ I like their (New Zealande rs) attitude towards life.  They usually  spend lots of time staying with their families and prepar ing daily meals. I tried to experience  the happiness of their lifestyle for a short time. After coming home, I began to pursue a higher level of  quality of life instead of being busy with my goals”.   Benefit  2: behavio ural change (10 of 15 interviewees addressed)   Changes in actions are often affected by experience and environment, includin g voluntary or  involuntary, temporary, or permanent changes. In this study, several participants (27%) mentioned that the  salary and expenditure in the programs lead to their behavio ural changes, as N1 said, “Although I can get  some salary every month, I m ust pay for the accommodation, meals, and many other fees. This is the first  time I need to plan my incomes and expenses
meals, and many other fees. This is the first  time I need to plan my incomes and expenses carefully in order not to exceed my living budget. I didn’t work  to earn money before but now I did know that earning money is not easy , and it changes my ways to  consume”.   Besides, several respondents (33%) mentioned that overseas experiential learning experience has  helped them change their habit of addiction to mobile and Internet. They were now more cherish the face -to- face communicat ion opportunities. Especially , N12 said, “ During our stay in New Zealand, we spent most of  our time in the tourism field, without Wi -Fi and mobiles. After  a few days, we realized that we could live a  good life without WIFI and mobiles; many calls or intern et information may not be so important… ”.  Benefit  3: multi ple skill development (10 of 15 interviewees addressed)   Participants in overseas exchange programs have seen obvious improved their language skills,  interpersonal skills, and independent living skil ls. The skills development of participants is discussed and  presented below.   Language skills. The improvement of language skills was shown in various aspects. Five interviewees  from  the short -term pro grams  said, “ I cherished the opportunity to make present ations in English during  class. Even facing similar contents, all rounded English environment gave us different feelings, and we were  forced to express ourselves in English (N13) .” More than half of the interviewees (53%) believed that they  had become more  proficient in English speaking, writing, reading, and listening, especially  for taking  TOEFL and IELTS tests.   Interpersonal skills . Previous studies have  confirmed  that s tudy abroad programs can significantly
Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     85 improve students’ ability to communicate with  foreigners (Kurpis and Hunter, 2017). N2 realizes that people  in western countries have more sense of privacy protection. Unless you take the initiative to talk about it,  other people won’t pry into your privacy or talk about  things you don’t want to  reveal. Therefore, she noted,  “I used to talk about anything with my friends and have no sense of boundaries. In the future, I will avoid  interfering with friends’ privacy issues, even if we are good friends”.   Independent living skills. It is worth noting that  many participants (53%) reported that it is difficult for  them to adapt to the local dietary  habits. For short -term pro gram  members (40%), they think this problem  can be overcome. By contrast, long -term program members need to find an alternative way, suc h as cooking  by themselves. N1 shared her experience of cooking during study abroad, “ When I first tried cooking, I  called with my mom and got the guidance of each step. Later, I was able to cook some simple daily dishes by  myself, and I was delighted to l earn cooking skills”.   Benefit  4: social bonding development (7 of 15 interviewees addressed)   The social connections between people will be enhanced and closer as they spend more time staying  together. In the process of adapting to the host society through direct and indirect contact with the local  community, international students gradually developed social bonding with the community and residents  (Gong et al., 2020; Tian and Lu, 2018) . The concrete performance is to establish and maintain relationship s  with the people they meet. Five participants  believed that they had developed their social bonds well with  other participants from their alma mater , the host university, and universities of other countries.  For example,  participants can interact with other pa rticipants from different countries and local people, so that their social  network
with other pa rticipants from different countries and local people, so that their social  network has been further expanded. N5 mentioned it’s fun to make friends with foreign ers.   Benefit  5: academic competitiveness & employability enhancement (5 of 15 interviewees addr essed)   Previous studies have shown that enhancing the professional competitive advantage is one of the  important factors to stimulate students to participate in overseas experiential learning programs (Mak et al.,  2017), w hich includes a cademic competitive ness and employability enhancement . N4, N5, N7 , N8, and N11  pointed out that overseas experiential learning experience is a bright spot on the ir resume because many  enterprises prefer  employees with the overseas learning experience. Besides , N11 believed t hat overseas  internship experience has more tremendous advantages than domestic internship experience so that the  candidates with overseas experience gain greater competitiveness. Both N6 and N15 said that the description  of their applications for graduate  school mainly focuses on  their overseas experiential learning experience.  N14 has finished applying for graduate school  and claimed that “ I attended an  interview for a graduate  school  in the mainland of China. During my interview, almost a ll their concern s were  on my overseas  experiential learning experience”.     Discussion   Theoretical implications   This study contributes to experiential learning cycle theory in the research of overseas exchange  programs. Kolb (1984) firstly proposed this theory, which includ es four stages named concrete experience,  reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. On this basis, this study  integrated the challenges and benefits of studying abroad in previous research and further identified their  antecedents  and consequences . This paper is a pioneer study that comprehensively and systematically  quest ed students’ experiences of overseas
a pioneer study that comprehensively and systematically  quest ed students’ experiences of overseas experiential learning  in the real survival and studying context . The  results showcased the four -stage learning pro cess of experiential learning in overseas exchange programs.  Our works not only advance the  conceptual definition of “culture adaptations” created by Gong et al. (2020),  but also explain the mechanism of how it appears during study abroad and how does it in turn benefit  students . Importantly, the four -stage learning process  offers  scholars a new perspective to understand  international students’ psychology and behavio гr performance. To this end, we believe that this research adds  new nuances to the literature by displaying the four -stage learning process with the help of experiential  learning cycle theory.   Moreover, compar ed with the results of previous studies, this study further detailed the challenges  encountered by students and the benefits they gained during study abroad. In the present study, li ving  challenges include language -based issues, social relations, catering culture, local customs (tipping culture),  and s ecurity and health, and learning challenges include academic pressure and internship difficulties. Some  of the results in this study are consistent with Tian and Lu’s (2018) and Gong et al.’s (2020) study, while  these new findings, such as security and hea lth, and internship difficulties, are the unique pe rception  of short - term exchange students . Tian and Lu (2018) consider  acculturation as international students’ responses to  such challenges. The process of overcoming these challenge s is the time for stude nts to grow . Studying  abroad immerses participants in another cultural environment and creates new opportunities for them to
Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     86 improve their comprehensive capacities (Hopkins, 1999). The results indicate d that  benefits during  study   abroad include cognitive d evelopment, behavio ural change, multiple skill development, social bonding  development, academic competitiveness & employability enhancement. These benefits are helpful for  students majoring in Hospitality and Tourism to lay a good foundation for future de velopment . Prior studies  have focused on the benefits of international degree courses, whereas this study provides implications for the  understanding of the benefits of international non -degree programs.     Practical implications   Since overseas experiential learning pro gram s create  many benefits for students’ personal development,  more international experiential learning opportunities should be provided for students by educational unit s.  The cases utilized in this study show the challenges  and benefits of ove rseas experiential learning pro gram s.  Based on the results of this study, program managers and students can evaluate the feasibility of the  experiential learning programs. On one hand, for students who are going to enrol  in non-degree programs,  even degree  courses, they can make a comprehensive consideration  and plan  for studying abroad according   to the predictable challenges and benefits . On the other hand, managers can improve marketing management  by includ ing security measures and various emergency plans  in the overseas experiential learning programs.  Besides, according to the results of the Chi-square test, operators should pay more attention to improving the  word -of-mouth generated by previous participants, and also safety issues as they are both import ant factors  for female students to make decisions, especially there are more female students than male students in the  hospitality and tourism field.

Conclusion and limitation   The experiential learning cycle theory is a n effective tool for interpreting  overseas experiential  learning.  In this study, qualitative methods were employed to explore students ’ experience process of  overseas  exchange programs. The results indicated that the challenges faced by students in the survival and  studying context can be co nceptualized as “cultural adaptation”, which in turn helps students gain benefits  in  many ways. By understanding the potential difficulties and benefits  in overseas experiential learning  programs from students’ perspectives, this study contributes to the teaching  program design, marketing  management, and preparation for studying  abroad related to overseas experiential learning. The limitation of  the study is that the survey was only conducted in universities in one city, which limit s the universality of the   findings to a certain extent. Also, this study only focused on short -term overseas experiential learning  programs, and further research can consider both long -term international degree courses and short -term  international exchange pr ograms .

Experien tial  learning is regarded as a valuable way to link up theoretical knowledge and practical skills in hospitality and tourism educa tion.  Although some studies have addressed the importance of experiential learning, the factors influencing students’ choice o f overseas  exchange programs, and the challenges and benefits of students’ experiential learning are still unclear, especially on the ov erseas  exchange programs. The purpose of this study is to reveal the whole picture of overseas exchange programs by util izing experiential  learning cycle theory, and further understand students’ perce ption of overseas experiential learning . By employing quantitative and  qualitative methods, including questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews with students who have partic ipated in the overseas  exchange programs and content analysis of program information, this study analyzes the differences of factors considered by males   and females  in choosing overseas exchange programs, and  displays  the four-stage  learning process  of exp eriential learning in  overseas exchange programs  and identifies two themes of challenges (living challenges and learning challenges) and five themes of  benefits (cognitive development, behavio ural change, multiple skill development, social bonding developm ent, academic  competitiveness & employability enhancement) for experiential learning for students majoring in Hospitality and Tourism.

enriches our understandings of the experiential learning cycle theory and provides insights to educators in the  design of future  overseas exchange programs.     Keywords:  experiential learning; challenges and benefits; overseas exchange programs; experiential learning cycle theory;  hospitality and tourism education       Introduction   Hospitality and Tourism is an interdisc iplinary subject that requires both theoretical knowledge and  practical skills. Therefore, bridging the gap between theory and practice becomes crucial in hospitality and  tourism education. Experiential learning approaches, such as field trips, role -playin g, overseas studying , and  so on, are considered effective ways to fill up the gap in the field of hospitality and tourism higher education.  Among those approaches, the overseas exchange programs are regarded as an extension of experiential  learning from th e traditional classroom to a further field (Hopkins, 1999), and have become increasingly  popular.  According to the report published by the Institute of International Education (2020), as shown in  Table 1, the number of non -degree international students in the United States has shown an overall growth  trend in the past two decades. International exchanges programs (non -degree) can be divided into five levels  according to the duration: several days to a few weeks; 3 -8 weeks, summer programs; semester; semeste r to  the academic year (this duration includes two levels) (Engle and Engle, 2003). There are obvious differences  in specific learning contents and forms at different levels, including site (enterprise, museum, etc.) visits;  “subject -matter” lectures and c ourse;  target -language course; international class; service -learning course;  work internship, and so on (Coker et al. 2017; Engle and Engle, 2003).  However, in the context of  experiential learning, the studies to identify students’ challenges and benefits in studying abroad programs  are limited. To
studies to identify students’ challenges and benefits in studying abroad programs  are limited. To improve the overall quality of higher education, it is necessary to understand the value of such  challenges and benefits created for students within the scope of humanities.   Kolb (1984) firstly developed the expe riential learning cycle theory, and it has been widely applied in  academic research and higher education practice. Researchers have reached a consensus that learning is a  continuous process grounded in experience (Kolb, 1984; Kolb and Kolb, 2005). And expe riential  learning is  the process of grasping and transforming knowledge to construct meaning from real -world experience (Kolb,  1984; Kolb and Kolb, 2017; Yardley et al., 2012). However, most  existing literature ignored the grasping   process and only paid at tention to the transforming  process  directly when analyzing experiential learning  project s (Yan and Cheung, 20 12). In other words, previous studies focu sed on the gains of experiential  learning for participants but d id not analyze the challenges faced by  participants in experiential learning  program s. More s pecifically, the motivation and decision -making, the benefits and value of this kind of  programs have received much attention (Bretag and van der Veen, 2017), but the questions of how  participants adapt to the new circumstance and how study abroad programs impact participants’ personal                                                              © Chieh Yun Yang, Dengming Xie, Jose Weng Chou Wong. 2021.

Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     80 growth are still under investigation  (Yu and Zhang, 2016) . Therefore, it is important to understand  what  difficulties students face and how they ultimately resolve them.     Table 1. Number of international non -degree students in the United States (1999 -2019)   Data source: Institute of International Education     This study aims to reveal the whole process of overseas experiential learning and explor e the  challenges and benefits of  overseas exchange programs in the field of hospitality and tourism.  Fifteen  students who had experience in such programs were invited to participate in this study. To understand their  motivations and concerns for making decisions before the program, diffi culties, and solutions during the  program, gains after the program, they were asked to answer a series of open -ended questions through the in - depth interview. The contribution of this study is twofold. First, applying experiential learning cycle theory,  this study enriches the literature of grasping and transforming process by identifying students’ challenges and  benefits of study abroad programs. Second, the results of this study provide implications for education  institutions (or program planners) to arra nge experiential learning programs more effectively and give  suggestions for participants (students) to choose appropriate experiential learning programs which are  beneficial for their personal growth.     Literature review   Experiential learning theory   Kolb ( 1984) stated that learning is the process whereby knowledge is created through the  transformation of experience; knowledge results from the combination of grasping and transforming  experience. He further defined experiential learning as the process of gras ping and transforming knowledge  to construct meaning from real -world experience (Kolb, 1984, p.41). Based on Dewey, Lewin, and Piaget’s  learning model, Kolb (1984) analyzed the process of experiential learning
Lewin, and Piaget’s  learning model, Kolb (1984) analyzed the process of experiential learning and developed the experiential  learning cycle theory (Figure 1), which includes four stages: concrete experience (CE), reflective observation  (RO), abstract conceptualization (AC), and active experimentation (AE). These four stages are categorized as  two primary dimensions of the learning process: the  grasping dimension (CE & AC) and the transforming  dimension (RO & AE). This reflects the two ways we learn. The first is how we perceive and grasp new  information or experience, and the second is how we process and transform what we receive (Healey and  Jenkins, 2000).
Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     81 Challenges and benefits of studying abroad   Smith and Khawaja (2011) argued that international students who choose to study abroad might  encounter many challenges, including acculturative stress and adaptation to the host country’s environ ment.  During the period of studying abroad, it is inevitable for international students to encounter a variety of  challenges or difficulties caused by different circumstances (Gong et al., 2020). Based on the acculturation  models, previous studies mentione d that language barriers, educational stressors, sociocultural stressors,  discrimination, lifestyle acculturative stressors, and psychological challenges were the main challenges faced  by international students (Pitts, 2016). For example, Yu and Zhang (201 6) found that mainland Chinese  students in Hong Kong experienced the challenges of language barriers, social interactions, political  identification, and discrimination. Previous studies have recognized various challenges, but the findings  of  these research  mainly relate to programs in the traditional classroom, rather than experiential learning  programs, in which students may encounter different challenges.   Steinberg (2002) pointed out that overseas experiential learning is laudable and creditworthy, and  identified the benefits of overseas experiential learning. For example, overseas experiential programs have  strong academic value for students to gain linguistic skills, intercultural learning abilities, and analytical and  conceptual skills. Numerous studies  suggested that such programs offer a particularly valuable experience  that cannot be substituted. This study agreed with the previous study that students on short -term (1 -8 weeks)  and long -term (typically a semester or longer) study abroad programs do sho w meaningful learning gains in  developing intercultural sensitivity, global perspective, linguistic ability, lifelong friendships with host - country nationals
global perspective, linguistic ability, lifelong friendships with host - country nationals (Coker et al., 2017). Although the benefits of various overseas experiential learning  programs hav e been mentioned in previous studies, the findings may be different and deserve particular  attention in different cultural contexts and different forms of programs.     Method s  Aiming to understand the process and outcomes of overseas experiential learning pr ograms, this study  adopted quantitative and qualitative methods to identify the key elements in whole experiential learning  stages as suggested by Tsaur et al. (2019) . A questionnaire survey with the theme of curriculum opinion  survey was carried out to examine what factors students mainly considered when choosing international  exchange pro gram s. Also, the in-depth interview was conducted to collect data in a way that allowed the  researchers to acquire detailed descriptions from the interviewees (DiCicco -Bloom and Crabtree, 2006).     Study context and data collection   Three overseas experiential learning programs in Macau Universities are involved in this study : New  Zealand Wines Industrial Field Trip Program (13 -days), U.S. International Hospitality & Tourism Academic  Program (3 -weeks), and U.S. Disney Internship Program (6 -months). The questionnaire data were borrowed   from a curriculum opinion survey conducted by the institution with the consent of the students and the  institution.  The data were based on the 7 7 students’ evaluation results of the importance (unimportant and  important) of five consideration  factors (program quality, program fee, previous participant evaluation,  safety, difficulty of application process) in choosing the programs.   The interview da ta collection for this study has three steps: First, after obtaining the permission of the  responsible education institution , the interview  invitations were sent to 77 students who had attend ed one of  the experiential learning
interview  invitations were sent to 77 students who had attend ed one of  the experiential learning programs . The invitation clea rly stated the purpose and the voluntary principle of  the interview and emphasized that all data are used for this research only and will not have any other impact  on the interviewee s. Students who were willing to participate in the interview were informed  that all contents  during the interview would be presented anonymously. Second, the in -depth interviews were conducted face - to-face in their native language . The interview guideline (See Appendix A ) was inspired by previous studies  (Yang et al., 2015) to understand students’ experiences (challenges and benefits) in overseas experiential  learning programs. Finally, the recorded interview transcripts were returned to all interviewees  correspondingly for proofreading the contents. No incentives were provided i n this study. A total of 15  students participated  in the in-depth interview, remarking them N1 to N15. 3 respondents were male, and 12  respondents were female. The number of respondents  in the three programs was 9, 3, and 3, respectively.  Overall, the inte rview took over 60 minutes on average, and the word count for the interview transcripts was  more than 30,000.     Data analysis   First, this study  adopted SPSS 23.0 to perform a Chi-square test on the questionnaire data. Second, the  text data were analyzed by deductive thematic analysis, which is to identify themes from qualitative data and
Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     82 answer the research questions  (Xu et al., 2018). Deductive thematic analysis is a top -down method, which  adopts the predetermined codebook based on literature. The code  label, the definition of themes and, the  descriptions of when the theme occurs are three critical elements involved in compiling the codebook (Xu et  al., 2018). Two researchers in this study strictly followed the coding  steps suggested by Fereday and Muir - Coch rane (2006) and work  independently. Then, the final codes were identified after negotiation.     Results  of the Chi-square test   Table 1 illustrates the results of the Chi -square test. The Chi -square test results show that there are  significant differences bet ween males and females on previous participants’ evaluation and safety. In terms of  the evaluation of the previous participants, p-value=0.000 <0.05, indicating while the most female (78.2%)  think the previous participant’s evaluation is important, male car es less about that ( only 22.7%). Regarding  safety, p-value =0.023 <0.05, indicating that  males and female s have significant differences in it. While most  female (72.7%) takes safety as an important factor to joining the international exchange program, more male  (54.5%) thinks that is not important. Besides, there are no significant  gender differences in students’  evaluation of program quality, program fee, and difficulty of the application pro cess.    Table 1.

The first element of concrete experience includes the experience  of survival context and studying context. In this study, the experience of survival context includes clothing,  food, house, and transportation, and so on. While the experience of  studying context includes seminars,  internships, field trips, role -play, and so on. And the reflection observation from the concrete experience  includes mainly the living and learning challenges. On the other hand, existing studies have shown that  cultura l adaptation is regarded as one of the reasons students feel challenges when studying abroad (Gong et  al., 2020). In response to these challenges, the participants adopted diverse strategic efforts to achieve  personal development in various aspects: cognit ive development, behavio ural change, multiple skill  development, social bonding development, academic competitiveness & employability enhancemen t.
Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     83   Living challenge 1: language -based issues (12 of 15 interviewees addressed)   Language -based issues in overse as exchange programs  include  language barriers and different cultural  expressions. Language barriers happen throughout their daily lives in all areas, such as restaurants,  supermarkets, the library, and travel ling. As N2 mentioned, “ I have passed many Engl ish-related language  exams, such as IELTS. But when I communicate with foreigners in person, some slangs, or expressions they  often use are unfamiliar to me, and they become our big language barriers ”.  As people from different cultural backgrounds may have  big differences in language expression, N4  and N14 expressed their embarrassment when they were praised in front of other students. For example, N4  stated, “ Even if I made a low -level mistake in the day ’s work, my manager would still say to me, ‘You did a   good job today, you worked hard. ’ This makes me feel ashamed, but afterward s, I realized that good is not  good enough. ‘Good’ means 90 points in our country but maybe it means 70 points here ”.   Living challenge 2: social relations (10 of 15 interviewees a ddressed)   When participants are joining the overseas exchange programs , everything around them is new and it  makes some of them feel unfamiliar and difficult to make new friends. Although they need to contact local  people, tourists, colleagues, and other p articipants in their daily life and work, it is still not easy  for students   to establish a friendship with other foreigners . “I am always thinking that people are treating me differently.  Some people are caring for me too much, while some others are neglec ting me . No matter what, I feel like I  am an outsider, and I don’t feel comfortable to make friends under this situation  (N5, N9)” .  Living challenge 3: local food culture (7 of 15 interviewees addressed)   The respondents who participated in the exchange pro gram
(7 of 15 interviewees addressed)   The respondents who participated in the exchange pro gram generally expressed that they had poor  adaptability to the local food culture. Many interviewees (40%) addressed that they tried hard to adapt to the  local food and beverage, but they would get sick or even had negative physical reactions. “ After comi ng here,  I often eat high -calorie foods such as barbecues and hamburgers, and my weight has increased significantly  in two months. There are not many food options here...  (N8)”. Many students (33%)  emphasized the ice  water drinking habit in the U.S., while  Chinese culture prefers warm or boiled water. As N3 said, “ If we eat  too much cold food, our body will become more susceptible to cold or humidity. But every time when I boiled  water in the morning , my American roommates feel strange and surprised. It’ s r eally a cultural shock for  them ”.  Living challenge 4: local customs (Tipping culture) (7 of 15 interviewees addressed)   In some Western countries, tipping is a recognition and thanks to the waitperson’s hard work in a  restaurant or hotel. However, it is not  necessary for Chinese social culture, and half of the participants (50%)  felt not comfortable with the tipping culture, as N7 noted , “When I first started living in the United States, I  don’t have the sense to tip the waiter s. Sometimes, the waiter will t ake the initiative to remind me if I forg et to  tip when I eat in the restaurant or take a taxi. Which made me very embarrassed, and then I gradually got  used to it”.   Living challenge 5: security and health (7 of 15 interviewees addressed)   In recent years, security has also become a big concern in overseas exchange programs. Two female  participants said that for safety reasons, they generally do not walk alone outdoors (N3, N5). In addition, N7
Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     84 said, “ It was more troublesome to see a doctor here. Besides lan guage, we don ’t know the address of the  hospital and the process of medical treatment, so I cannot go to the hospital alone. Sometimes I don’t even  know whom I should ask… ”. Some students (20%) would therefore overlook their health issues, “ The best  soluti on to this question is not to get sick… (N5)”.   Learning challenge 1: academic pressure (13 of 15 interviewees addressed)   A new foreign educational system different from hometown will put academic pressure on international  students . Also, when students get used to traditional classroom teaching, the experiential learning model will  also booster their challenges. Smith and Khawaja (2011) believed that t his problem typically arose  when  international  students attempt to adopt  a new educational environment. In this study, the foreign cultural  background and the form of experiential learning programs are new educational environments for most  students. Therefore, academic pressure was one of the difficulties that participants can hardly avoid. “ We  have English less ons at my home university . In class, I can understand the teacher’ s words and sentences ,  but I can’t understand the teaching logic very well. Instead of going out and writing a report, sometimes I  prefer sitting in the classroom and writing an exam paper a fter the course (N13) ”.  Learning challenge 2: internship difficulties (5 of 15 interviewees addressed)   The difficulties from the internship include their language proficiency, lack of practical working  experiences, and collaboration with colleagues. N7 men tioned that the internship work made her feel  physically and psychologically exhausted. She even considered giving up the internship. N5 shared some  comments, “ During this internship, my mistakes sometimes lead to customer dissatisfaction, and it makes me  very sad. I felt that I was bringing troubles to customers and
dissatisfaction, and it makes me  very sad. I felt that I was bringing troubles to customers and colleagues rather than giving help”.   Benefit  1: cognitive development (13 of 15 interviewees addressed)   Learning is a cognitive development linking  persistent acclimatization with environmental  engagement.  The c ognitive development through overseas experiential learning is mainly reflected in the perception of  oneself (self -awareness and self -understanding), other people (social communication), and other things  (international perspectives, cultu ral and global diversity, racial, ethnic diversity, and complexities of global  issues) (Tian and Lu, 2018). In the present study, respondents’ self -rated improvement appears in self- confidence, open -mindedness, independence, and self-reflection, and actual ization. N6 believe d that she ha s  become braver than before, “ I have met a lot of people during the internship, and they liked me very much.  Now, I am more confident and dare to express my opinions positively ”. N12 was very excited to share with  the interv iewer the changes in his attitude towards life, “ I like their (New Zealande rs) attitude towards life.  They usually  spend lots of time staying with their families and prepar ing daily meals. I tried to experience  the happiness of their lifestyle for a short time. After coming home, I began to pursue a higher level of  quality of life instead of being busy with my goals”.   Benefit  2: behavio ural change (10 of 15 interviewees addressed)   Changes in actions are often affected by experience and environment, includin g voluntary or  involuntary, temporary, or permanent changes. In this study, several participants (27%) mentioned that the  salary and expenditure in the programs lead to their behavio ural changes, as N1 said, “Although I can get  some salary every month, I m ust pay for the accommodation, meals, and many other fees. This is the first  time I need to plan my incomes and expenses
meals, and many other fees. This is the first  time I need to plan my incomes and expenses carefully in order not to exceed my living budget. I didn’t work  to earn money before but now I did know that earning money is not easy , and it changes my ways to  consume”.   Besides, several respondents (33%) mentioned that overseas experiential learning experience has  helped them change their habit of addiction to mobile and Internet. They were now more cherish the face -to- face communicat ion opportunities. Especially , N12 said, “ During our stay in New Zealand, we spent most of  our time in the tourism field, without Wi -Fi and mobiles. After  a few days, we realized that we could live a  good life without WIFI and mobiles; many calls or intern et information may not be so important… ”.  Benefit  3: multi ple skill development (10 of 15 interviewees addressed)   Participants in overseas exchange programs have seen obvious improved their language skills,  interpersonal skills, and independent living skil ls. The skills development of participants is discussed and  presented below.   Language skills. The improvement of language skills was shown in various aspects. Five interviewees  from  the short -term pro grams  said, “ I cherished the opportunity to make present ations in English during  class. Even facing similar contents, all rounded English environment gave us different feelings, and we were  forced to express ourselves in English (N13) .” More than half of the interviewees (53%) believed that they  had become more  proficient in English speaking, writing, reading, and listening, especially  for taking  TOEFL and IELTS tests.   Interpersonal skills . Previous studies have  confirmed  that s tudy abroad programs can significantly
Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     85 improve students’ ability to communicate with  foreigners (Kurpis and Hunter, 2017). N2 realizes that people  in western countries have more sense of privacy protection. Unless you take the initiative to talk about it,  other people won’t pry into your privacy or talk about  things you don’t want to  reveal. Therefore, she noted,  “I used to talk about anything with my friends and have no sense of boundaries. In the future, I will avoid  interfering with friends’ privacy issues, even if we are good friends”.   Independent living skills. It is worth noting that  many participants (53%) reported that it is difficult for  them to adapt to the local dietary  habits. For short -term pro gram  members (40%), they think this problem  can be overcome. By contrast, long -term program members need to find an alternative way, suc h as cooking  by themselves. N1 shared her experience of cooking during study abroad, “ When I first tried cooking, I  called with my mom and got the guidance of each step. Later, I was able to cook some simple daily dishes by  myself, and I was delighted to l earn cooking skills”.   Benefit  4: social bonding development (7 of 15 interviewees addressed)   The social connections between people will be enhanced and closer as they spend more time staying  together. In the process of adapting to the host society through direct and indirect contact with the local  community, international students gradually developed social bonding with the community and residents  (Gong et al., 2020; Tian and Lu, 2018) . The concrete performance is to establish and maintain relationship s  with the people they meet. Five participants  believed that they had developed their social bonds well with  other participants from their alma mater , the host university, and universities of other countries.  For example,  participants can interact with other pa rticipants from different countries and local people, so that their social  network
with other pa rticipants from different countries and local people, so that their social  network has been further expanded. N5 mentioned it’s fun to make friends with foreign ers.   Benefit  5: academic competitiveness & employability enhancement (5 of 15 interviewees addr essed)   Previous studies have shown that enhancing the professional competitive advantage is one of the  important factors to stimulate students to participate in overseas experiential learning programs (Mak et al.,  2017), w hich includes a cademic competitive ness and employability enhancement . N4, N5, N7 , N8, and N11  pointed out that overseas experiential learning experience is a bright spot on the ir resume because many  enterprises prefer  employees with the overseas learning experience. Besides , N11 believed t hat overseas  internship experience has more tremendous advantages than domestic internship experience so that the  candidates with overseas experience gain greater competitiveness. Both N6 and N15 said that the description  of their applications for graduate  school mainly focuses on  their overseas experiential learning experience.  N14 has finished applying for graduate school  and claimed that “ I attended an  interview for a graduate  school  in the mainland of China. During my interview, almost a ll their concern s were  on my overseas  experiential learning experience”.     Discussion   Theoretical implications   This study contributes to experiential learning cycle theory in the research of overseas exchange  programs. Kolb (1984) firstly proposed this theory, which includ es four stages named concrete experience,  reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. On this basis, this study  integrated the challenges and benefits of studying abroad in previous research and further identified their  antecedents  and consequences . This paper is a pioneer study that comprehensively and systematically  quest ed students’ experiences of overseas
a pioneer study that comprehensively and systematically  quest ed students’ experiences of overseas experiential learning  in the real survival and studying context . The  results showcased the four -stage learning pro cess of experiential learning in overseas exchange programs.  Our works not only advance the  conceptual definition of “culture adaptations” created by Gong et al. (2020),  but also explain the mechanism of how it appears during study abroad and how does it in turn benefit  students . Importantly, the four -stage learning process  offers  scholars a new perspective to understand  international students’ psychology and behavio гr performance. To this end, we believe that this research adds  new nuances to the literature by displaying the four -stage learning process with the help of experiential  learning cycle theory.   Moreover, compar ed with the results of previous studies, this study further detailed the challenges  encountered by students and the benefits they gained during study abroad. In the present study, li ving  challenges include language -based issues, social relations, catering culture, local customs (tipping culture),  and s ecurity and health, and learning challenges include academic pressure and internship difficulties. Some  of the results in this study are consistent with Tian and Lu’s (2018) and Gong et al.’s (2020) study, while  these new findings, such as security and hea lth, and internship difficulties, are the unique pe rception  of short - term exchange students . Tian and Lu (2018) consider  acculturation as international students’ responses to  such challenges. The process of overcoming these challenge s is the time for stude nts to grow . Studying  abroad immerses participants in another cultural environment and creates new opportunities for them to
Advanced Education, 19 , 2021     86 improve their comprehensive capacities (Hopkins, 1999). The results indicate d that  benefits during  study   abroad include cognitive d evelopment, behavio ural change, multiple skill development, social bonding  development, academic competitiveness & employability enhancement. These benefits are helpful for  students majoring in Hospitality and Tourism to lay a good foundation for future de velopment . Prior studies  have focused on the benefits of international degree courses, whereas this study provides implications for the  understanding of the benefits of international non -degree programs.     Practical implications   Since overseas experiential learning pro gram s create  many benefits for students’ personal development,  more international experiential learning opportunities should be provided for students by educational unit s.  The cases utilized in this study show the challenges  and benefits of ove rseas experiential learning pro gram s.  Based on the results of this study, program managers and students can evaluate the feasibility of the  experiential learning programs. On one hand, for students who are going to enrol  in non-degree programs,  even degree  courses, they can make a comprehensive consideration  and plan  for studying abroad according   to the predictable challenges and benefits . On the other hand, managers can improve marketing management  by includ ing security measures and various emergency plans  in the overseas experiential learning programs.  Besides, according to the results of the Chi-square test, operators should pay more attention to improving the  word -of-mouth generated by previous participants, and also safety issues as they are both import ant factors  for female students to make decisions, especially there are more female students than male students in the  hospitality and tourism field.     Conclusion and limitation   The experiential learning cycle theory is a n effective tool for
Conclusion and limitation   The experiential learning cycle theory is a n effective tool for interpreting  overseas experiential  learning.  In this study, qualitative methods were employed to explore students ’ experience process of  overseas  exchange programs. The results indicated that the challenges faced by students in the survival and  studying context can be co nceptualized as “cultural adaptation”, which in turn helps students gain benefits  in  many ways. By understanding the potential difficulties and benefits  in overseas experiential learning  programs from students’ perspectives, this study contributes to the teaching  program design, marketing  management, and preparation for studying  abroad related to overseas experiential learning. The limitation of  the study is that the survey was only conducted in universities in one city, which limit s the universality of the   findings to a certain extent. Also, this study only focused on short -term overseas experiential learning  programs, and further research can consider both long -term international degree courses and short -term  international exchange pr ograms .

El artículo "Challenges and Benefits of Experiential Learning: The Case of Overseas Exchange Programs", publicado en 2021 en la revista Advanced Education por Chieh Yun Yang, Dengming Xie y Jose Weng Chou Wong de la Universidad de Ciencia y Tecnología de Macao, examina la creciente popularidad de los programas de intercambio en el extranjero como una forma de aprendizaje experiencial, especialmente en el ámbito de la educación en hospitalidad y turismo. Los autores argumentan que este tipo de aprendizaje es crucial para conectar la teoría con la práctica.

### Contexto y Justificación
El artículo destaca que, a pesar de la creciente participación de estudiantes en programas de intercambio, aún no se comprenden completamente los factores que influyen en su elección ni los desafíos y beneficios que enfrentan. Se menciona un informe del Instituto de Educación Internacional que indica un aumento constante en el número de estudiantes internacionales en Estados Unidos, lo que subraya la necesidad de investigar más sobre sus experiencias.

### Objetivo del Estudio
El estudio busca ofrecer una visión integral de los programas de intercambio en el extranjero utilizando la teoría del ciclo de aprendizaje experiencial de Kolb, profundizando en la percepción de los estudiantes sobre el aprendizaje experiencial en el extranjero.

### Metodología
Se emplearon métodos cuantitativos y cualitativos, incluyendo encuestas y entrevistas en profundidad con estudiantes que han participado en programas de intercambio. Se analizan las diferencias en los factores que hombres y mujeres consideran al elegir estos programas. Se identifican dos categorías de desafíos: desafíos de vida y desafíos de aprendizaje, y se destacan cinco beneficios: desarrollo cognitivo, cambio de comportamiento, desarrollo de múltiples habilidades, fortalecimiento de lazos sociales y mejora de la competitividad académica y empleabilidad.

### Teoría del Aprendizaje Experiencial
El estudio se basa en la teoría del ciclo de aprendizaje experiencial de Kolb, que incluye cuatro etapas: experiencia concreta, observación reflexiva, conceptualización abstracta y experimentación activa. Estas etapas se agrupan en dos dimensiones: asimiento (CE y AC) y transformación (RO y AE), reflejando cómo los aprendices perciben y procesan la información.

### Desafíos y Beneficios
Los desafíos identificados incluyen barreras lingüísticas, dificultades en la adaptación cultural, problemas de seguridad y presión académica. Los beneficios, por otro lado, abarcan el desarrollo de habilidades interpersonales, la mejora de la competencia lingüística y el fortalecimiento de la red social de los estudiantes.

### Resultados del Estudio
Los resultados revelan que los estudiantes enfrentan desafíos significativos, como problemas de comunicación y adaptación a nuevas costumbres, pero también experimentan un desarrollo personal y profesional notable. Se identifican diferencias de género en la importancia que los estudiantes otorgan a factores como la seguridad y la evaluación de participantes anteriores.

### Implicaciones Prácticas
El estudio sugiere que las instituciones educativas deben considerar estos hallazgos al diseñar programas de intercambio, enfatizando la necesidad de apoyo para los estudiantes en su adaptación cultural y académica. Se recomienda que los programas incluyan medidas de seguridad y planes de emergencia, así como la promoción de experiencias previas de participantes para atraer a futuros estudiantes.

### Limitaciones y Futuras Investigaciones
Se reconocen limitaciones en la investigación, como el enfoque en universidades de una sola ciudad y la exclusión de programas de larga duración. Se sugiere que futuras investigaciones aborden estos aspectos para obtener una comprensión más completa de las experiencias de los estudiantes en programas de intercambio.

### Conclusión
El artículo concluye que los programas de intercambio en el extranjero son herramientas valiosas en la educación de hospitalidad y turismo, y que la teoría del ciclo de aprendizaje experiencial proporciona un marco efectivo para entender y aplicar estos conceptos. Se enfatiza la necesidad de una investigación más equilibrada que considere tanto los beneficios como los desafíos de estos programas, contribuyendo así a una comprensión más completa de su impacto en los estudiantes.
