Innov. 2012, Volume 7, Issue 2 Business Incubation in Chile: Development, Financing and Financial Services Aruna Chandra1, Maria Alejandra Medrano Silva2 Abstract Business incubation in Chile is still in its nascent stages, with approximately 27 incubators supported primarily by a  coalition of government and universities. Chilean business incubators tend to capitalize on regional resource strengths  and have a strategic focus on high growth, high innovation, high impact businesses as a result of a government mandate to  focus on developing business with high potential for economic development and job creation.  The government’s efforts to  create the framework conditions for entrepreneurship by investing in business incubators, organizing risk capital for early  stage ventures to fill capital market gaps and support for angel networks as well as incubator funding are discussed. Policy  implications for the continued growth of the incubation industry are provided.

2Business Incubation in Chile:  Development, Financing and Financial Services Business incubators which  provide fertile environments for  new ventures are relatively new hybrid organizational enti - ties that could be viewed as  part of a country’s institutional  ecosystem or entrepreneurial framework conditions (EFCs)  that constitute   resources, as well as supporting market and  regulatory institutions  (Bosma et al., 2008; Isenberg, 2010)   to transition Chile from an efficiency-driven to innovation- driven stage of economic growth (Porter, Sachs and Arthur,  2002) marked by knowledge spillovers (Acs and Amoros,  2008) and high growth, scalable entrepreneurship.  Business  incubators develop networks of multiplex ties with a range  of actors that offer financial, human and social capital (Mian,  1997).   These incubator networks in turn add value by cre - ating institutionalized structures for resource and knowl - edge transfer that benefit the young incubatee firm (Hansen  et al., 2000).  A majority of business incubators around the  world are run as non-profits sustained by plural sources of  funds from the government as well as nominal rents and  fees charged to in-house client firms.  Given their non-profit  business model and lack of self-sustainability, set in a context  of thin or non-existent capital markets government funding  and support plays a major role in incubator and incubatee  financial support. Over the past two decades, governments have viewed busi - ness incubators as tools of addressing market failure to ame - liorate the twin liabilities of newness and lack of visibility  for new ventures (Bollingtoft and Ulhoi, 2005), bestowing  financial support for both incubator and client firms housed  in incubators.  Governments in Latin America and most no - tably in Chile, which has a nascent incubation market, are  developing publicly funded programs in the context of a de - veloping incubation market space with a view to promoting  a better
in the context of a de - veloping incubation market space with a view to promoting  a better institutional environment for innovative entrepre - neurship (Echecopar, 2004) in addition to dismantling several  institutional barriers constraining equity funding (Amoros,  Felzensztein and Gimmon, 2010).  Age and stage of develop - ment determine a new venture’s capital needs (Shane, 2008);  in Chile early stage new ventures face equity gaps, that cover  funds that are too large for the 3F’s, but too small for formal  venture capital (Amoros, Altienza and Romani, 2008).  Chile,  like many Latin American countries tends to have high rates  of “necessity” based entrepreneurs (Bosma and Levie, 2010)  which could be a function of the stage of economic develop - ment as well as a by-product of weak institutional environ - ments that is more likely to foster the growth of survival  scale entrepreneurs (De Soto, 1989). The focus of this paper is on the business incubator market  space in Chile with an emphasis on the ways in which the  triple helix of government, universities and industry work together to support incubator development.   The introduc - tory section of the paper is followed by a method section  describing the qualitative data collection methods followed  by a review of institutional theory and network theory as  it pertains to entrepreneurship development and incubator  networks. Incubator development and growth, funding struc - ture and early stage financing available for new ventures are  discussed in the following sections with an emphasis on the  rich interplay of the triple helix of government, industry and  academia in creating the institutional framework conditions  for entrepreneurship, especially in the area of early stage  risk capital for young ventures.  Findings and policy recom - mendations regarding incubator development in Chile are  discussed in the concluding section.   Method The paper is based on research that represents findings  from seven
concluding section.   Method The paper is based on research that represents findings  from seven structured, on-site interviews conducted with  key business incubator stakeholders in Chile.  Incubator  managers and staff, policy makers and academics were in - terviewed for this study.  The interview instrument for the  semi-structured, in-depth interviews was developed after a  thorough literature review and revised on the basis of pi - lot interviews conducted in the United States, as well as  the authors’ experience gained from similar interviews in  the United States, Thailand, China and India.  The pilot in - terviews served as a pre-test for instrument validation and  changes were made to the interview instrument based on  the findings and comments.  The instrument was pre-tested  and adapted to the Chilean environment by scholars and  consultants with extensive experience in Latin America. The  instrument was first translated from English into Spanish  and then translated back by a Spanish-speaking colleague. It  was then proofread and modified by another native Spanish  speaker from an academic environment to ensure the ac - curacy of translation.  The semi-structured interview format  was selected, since this modality provides for focused and  systematic information collection, while allowing the inter - viewee to provide relevant contextual information appropri - ate to each case.  Institutional Theory and Entrepreneurship   in Chile Governments around the world support entrepreneurship  through policies that are conducive to the creation of an  overall environment for new venture creation (Lerner, 2009)  since innovation by new ventures has been linked to eco - nomic growth and job creation (Acs and Audretsch, 1988;  Thurik and Wennekers, 2004).  Many new ventures fail due  to paucity of risk capital, the life blood of  high potential  new ventures that start  with voracious capital requirements  particularly in their early stages when mortality rates are

3highest; hence capital markets are an integral part of creat - ing an entrepreneurship ecosystem (Isenberg, 2010).  Gaps  in the market for risk capital to fuel this growth is all too  common in developed and developing countries, hence this  gap in the financing chain for new ventures and its impact on  firm survival is well documented (Acs, 2006).  Governments  play a key role in shaping the institutional ecosystem for cap - ital markets with institutional theory arguing for the impor - tance of strong market institutions to support the growth  of capital markets (Lerner, 2009).  Weak, fragmented or con - straining institutional environments in incipient markets may  lead to market failure (Easterly, 2006) and consequent loss  of positive spillovers or contagion effects from innovative  young firms.  Governments with deeper and more powerful  resources can address market failure caused by institutional  voids in risk capital markets (Mair and Marti, 2009) through  public policies designed to provide early stage financing  (Storey, 2005) to fill the funding gap, in spite of arguments  against government intervention or government failure lead - ing to inefficient use of funds from the public purse (Storey,  2005; De Meza, 2002).  Network Theory and Business Incubators   in Chile Business incubators in Chile focus on internal and exter - nal networking, assisting incubatees with finding funding, and  connecting incubatees to a range of actors to facilitate re - source and knowledge flows.  Fluid, dynamic and multiplex    networks between the incubator and its partners allow ran - dom and multiple points of contact creating both strong and  weak ties (Granovetter, 1973) that enable access to novel  ideas, knowledge transfer and learning across the network  (Rangan, 2000), in addition to facilitating resource acquisi - tion and opportunity exploitation by entrepreneurial actors  by connecting them with resource providers (Aldrich and  Wiedenmayer, 1993).
actors  by connecting them with resource providers (Aldrich and  Wiedenmayer, 1993).  Public-private partnerships forged by  the business incubator create a web of relationships with  the capacity for influencing the broader business environ - ment.  For instance, partners from the financial community  may enhance client access to various types of early stage  financing (Ayers and Harman, 2009).  Networking benefits  include knowledge spillovers as well as access to business  angels, who not only provide capital, but also experience  and contacts to firms crossing dangerous “death valleys”  (Bygrave and Quill, 2007).  In addition, a strong angel net - work that brings funding at the pre-venture capital stage is  complementary to the more formal funding that a firm is  expected to need as it matures (Harrison and Mason, 2000). Growth and development of business   incubators in Chile Chile has a nascent, but growing business incubation indus - try with approximately 27 incubators (CORFO, 2012), mak - ing it the second largest incubation market in South America  after Brazil.  Out of the 27 incubators, 17 are operational  with 10 in the process of creation.  Since the early 1990s,  the government has been investing heavily in business in - cubators to promote entrepreneurship.  While government  support of incubation in Chile is fairly ubiquitous, universi - ties also play an important role by providing education and  training, R&D transfer and other in-kind support, along with  private investors, in creating a healthy innovation ecosys - tem to foster new venture creation and growth.  Santiago  Innova, the first incubator in Chile, was started in 1992 by  the municipal government of Santiago, with the objective of  creating jobs for the local economy (Santiago Innova Inter - view, 2009).  Though still relatively small in number when  compared to Brazil’s 400-plus incubators, the Chilean model  of incubation represents a concerted effort by government,  universities
the Chilean model  of incubation represents a concerted effort by government,  universities and industry to foster new ventures through a  systematic and well-organized institutional infrastructure,  with noteworthy attempts by government to organize risk  capital for early stage financing of new ventures, as well as  different types of support for incubator funding and angel  network development. Chile INCUBA, a trade association of business incubators  serves as a representative voice for business incubators  in Chile and the Chilean Economic Development Agency  (CORFO), the government agency that deals with small busi - ness and entrepreneurship provide various types of financial  support for incubators and incubatees.  The focus of Chil - ean incubators is on a wide variety of industries, with two  particular things in common: high growth (i.e. doubling its  sales per year) and innovation in products, services, or busi - ness model (Octantis Interview, 2006).  The incubators are  distributed geographically throughout Chile, so that every  region has the capacity, resources, and expertise to support  a potentially high-impact and creative business. Because in - novation and high growth are CORFO’s mandates (CORFO  Interview, 2006), all formal Chilean incubators, which are fi - nanced primarily through CORFO, usually look for projects  that will satisfy these two requirements.  In this context,  innovation is defined in rather broad terms and does not  have to be high-tech; innovation can be demonstrated in  products, services, or business models.  While the primary  focus is on fostering innovative companies with high growth  potential, the government also looks for economic impact in  terms of job creation in economically disadvantaged regions.  Incubators in Chile add value to client firms by acting as  intermediary between the government or private sector  participants and entrepreneurs.  They are currently grap - ISSN: 0718-2724.

4pling with issues related to their strategic focus, nature of  incubation in terms of general versus specialized focus, and  questions related to self-sustainability and length of govern - ment support.   Performance criteria such as the number of  incubated companies, number of successful graduates and  number of employees, level of sales / tax revenue generated  of incubate and graduated firms are typically used to assess  incubator performance (CORFO Interview, 2006). Business Incubator Service Profile in Chile Chilean incubators seek to promote job creation, economic  development, innovation, and high growth by providing a  wide variety of services that are typical to most incuba - tors: physical space and infrastructure, business consulting  and training, help with funding applications (government and  private), patenting assistance and IP protection, technology  transfer, and networking.  All Chilean incubators provided  basic administrative services (office space, infrastructure,  secretarial and administrative services).  However, incuba - tors tended to emphasize high value services such as con - sulting, training and networking.  However, the major focus of Chilean incubators is on net - working.  This is often done informally as incubators host  breakfast meetings with industry experts or bring in pro - fessionals to mentor their clients.  Often this is of critical  importance because these experts provide an objective ex - pert assessment of the business idea.  Moreover, these con - nections have potential to lead to new market access, sup - plier contacts, or even subcontracting.   Internal networking  among client firms as well as networking through Chile In - cuba was found to be prevalent (Octantis Interview, 2006).   Sources of Incubator Support/Funding Business incubators typically utilize a combination of three  types of revenue models (infoDev Incubator Support Cent - er, 2007).  The first revenue model incorporates the rev - enue from rental
Support Cent - er, 2007).  The first revenue model incorporates the rev - enue from rental income from tenants and other revenues  derived from client fees for consulting and other services.   This “landlord” model can be financially self-sufficient, given  “free” buildings and minimum economies of scale.  The sec - ond revenue model involves the incubator taking an equity  position in its more promising client firms and has the po - tential to generate revenues from sharing in client success  or royalty agreements on gross sales and brokerage fees  on raising finance.  This method however requires substan - tial initial investment and a great deal of patience, as it may  take up to 10 years to generate revenues.  The third, and  most common, method is to rely on an ongoing sponsor  funding, such as the university, government at the federal /  state / local levels, of private foundation or industry support   (Lalkaka, 2001). Almost all business incubators in Chile are funded primarily  by a coalition of the government, universities, private insti - tutions, or research centers, with government footing the  lion’s share of the costs of incubator setup and ongoing sup - port through different dedicated lines of funding to support  the life cycle financial needs of the incubators. CORFO cur - rently offers a line of funds to support incubator operation  and management that subsidizes up to 65% of total project  cost or a maximum of US$450,000 approximately at cur - rent exchange rates, that is open to new as well as existing  incubators that have previously received government fund - ing through the Development and Innovation Fund (Fondo  de Desarollo e Innovación – FDI) or from the InnovaChile  committee. University sponsorship includes both tangible  and intangible support in the form of physical space, infra - structure, access to faculty and students, and in-kind ser - vices.  The majority of incubators are physically located on  university campuses to gain access
- vices.  The majority of incubators are physically located on  university campuses to gain access to university expertise  and resources.  Private funding, has been relatively rare, has  been increasing of late with Octantis receiving about $6.5  million from private funds (Rios, 2011).  Private funds also  come usually from companies who hope later to acquire  some of the technologies developed by new ventures at the  incubators (CORFO, 2012). The Chilean incubation system utilizes a multi-tiered ap - proach to incubator models focused on: 1) high growth, high  impact, scalable ventures, 2) technological innovation, and  3) regional focus or generalist incubators whose primary  emphasis is job creation and local economic development  (CORFO Interview, 2006).   Of late, the government through  CORFO has been encouraging incubators to define their  own particular profile: innovative (high entrepreneurship  potential) or traditional (local impact) based on local condi - tions and internal criteria, such as the type of incubatee firm  (Rios, 2011). All interviewed incubator managers emphasized the tre - mendous role of government funding through CORFO.  For  instance, Octantis, the best known Chilean incubator, re - ceived as much as 80% of its budget from CORFO through  a government program (Octantis Interview, 2006).  In other  cases there were plural sources of support, i.e. strong uni - versity sponsors, as in the case of DICTUC at Catholic Uni - versity, where almost 35% is sponsored by CORFO (DIC - TUC Interview, 2006).  In another case, the Access Nova  incubator is fully owned by the University, but it still received  some funding from the government (Access Nova Interview,  2006).  Many incubators were able to raise other kinds of  funding from various sources to complement government  support, private funds in the case of Ventana at the Catho - lic University in Santiago, and the incubator at Arturo Prat  University in Iquique, infoDev (World Bank), grants

5a combination of public/private support as with Octantis at  the Adolfo Ibanez University in Santiago, and DICTUC at  the Pontifical Catholic University in Santiago, Chile.  Another  incubator, the Iner los Lagos, redefined its financing strategy  by the end of 2010.  These changes allowed it to raise $1  million dollars in 2011, with70% of these funds coming from  the public sector and 30% from the private sector (ChileIn - cuba, 2012). The Chilean incubator funding model indicated that incu - bators combine various revenue streams, relying mostly on  government ongoing support (in many cases for up to 80%),  but they also incorporated nominal rental and incubation  service fees, with some taking  equity positions in their client  companies to generate funds for ongoing operations.  Sourc - es of revenue for incubators in Chile included rental fees,  which provided a steady source of financial support in most  cases.  For example, AccessNova charged tenants a monthly  nominal fee equal to US$350 for physical infrastructure and  services (AccessNova Interview, 2006).  Octantis also calcu - lated direct costs and spread them into monthly payments  for companies (Octantis Interview, 2006).  Another revenue  source for incubators, albeit a long-term one is taking an  equity share in their promising incubatees.  These were long- term assets, since it typically took up to 10 years to realize  returns, and a portfolio of at least 20 companies to spread  the risk (infoDev Incubator Support Center, 2007).  Incuba - tors in Chile often took between 10% (Ventana) and 35%  (DICTUC) of an equity share.  However, incubator managers  realized that most of these investments may never realize a  return on investment (Ventana Interview, 2006).  Financing New Ventures / Incubatees and Risk Capi - tal Infrastructure Entrepreneurs face a critical phase in the development of  a new business during the initial stages. Early concept stage  seed capital typically came from personal funds,
during the initial stages. Early concept stage  seed capital typically came from personal funds, government  funds and angel investors (Amoros et al., 2010).  The Chilean  government in an effort to fill the gaps in the financing cycle  has taken an active role by offering seed and risk capital lines  through CORFO to support its broader mission of creating  innovative new businesses by connecting new business op - portunities with financing.  Through CORFO’s Innova Chile  program, it provided various lines of seed capital or smart  capital for new ventures sponsored by business incubators,  universities or industry groups (CORFO Interview, 2006).  In  addition, the government has worked with banks to create  the NACE fund to provide early stage funding that does not  require collateral.  Angel investors were another source of  seed capital; however they tended to support growth stage,  income generating projects that were not too risky.  Dur - ing the later phases of early growth and accelerated growth  stages, the government has designed risk capital funds that support these stages via co-investment  instruments  designed by CORFO that have effectively attracted more  private capital (Amoros et al., 2010).  Finally, entrepreneurs  tried to access bank loans at the later stages of growth after  establishing a track record. Seed Capital for Early Stage The seed capital program (Capital Semilla) developed by  CORFO, is  aimed at supporting  new ventures in the idea  stage for help with business plan development and  activities  associated with  initiation of operations (Echecopar, Angele - lli and Galleguillos, 2006).  The two lines of funding in the  seed capital program, L1 and L2, have been replaced with  a single Seed Capital Program in 2011, which is based on a  new policy of “rewards” that depends on the “milestones”  achieved by the projects supported by the incubators, such  as increase in sales (Rios, 2011).  In addition, access to the  seed funds is
the incubators, such  as increase in sales (Rios, 2011).  In addition, access to the  seed funds is contingent on sponsorship either by an incu - bator or a related institution (Echecopar, Angelelli and Gal - leguillos, 2006).  CORFO has also created a seed fund of flexible assignation  (SSFA) (Subsidio Semilla de Asignación Flexible-SSAF). This  tool allowed the incubators to access funds from a sort of  checking account to be used for their incubated projects.   These resources are earmarked for exclusive use for incu - batee projects and may not be used for the incubators’ own  purposes (CORFO, 2012).  IncubaUC, an incubator of the  Pontifical Catholic University in Chile expects this program  to support innovative entrepreneurs with high risk projects  to develop their business in the early stages of their crea - tion (ChileIncuba, 2012).  The government has also devel - oped a T echnology Package Program for new businesses  (Empaquetamiento T ecnológico para nuevos Negocios), to  support the technological development of sophisticated  businesses with high growth potential and a proven com - mercial opportunity (CORFO, 2012).  Lack of an entrepreneurial culture in the scientific and tech - nological community in Chile is recognized as one of the  major barriers to the transfer of basic research into com - mercial products (Jimenez, 2011).  T o address this issue in  Chile, the government has created other funds, including  FONDEF under CONICYT (FONDEF , 2012), the Nation - al Commission for Scientific and T echnological Innovation,  which is focused on the development of human capital to  advance technological innovation. Recently, CONICYT,  through FONDEF has launched a contest to evaluate re - search conducted in universities with the objective of trans - lating this research into new businesses to address the is - sue of paucity of entrepreneurial culture in the scientific/  technological community.

6Chile, a “privately owned, non-profit institution, created in  1976 by the Government of Chile and ITT Corporation of  the United States” (Fundación Chile, 2012).  Fundación Chile  has one of the initiatives to finance projects during the early  growth stage through its own risk capital fund (Echecopar,  Angelelli and Galleguillos, 2006).     Risk Capital for growth stage By the time entrepreneurs have a  product prototype and  have started operations, the new venture requires another  injection of capital for the next phase of its growth and gov - ernment funds fill the gap at this stage as well (Echecopar,  Angelelli and Galleguillos, 2006).  Risk Capital for Innovative  Businesses program was devoted to the creation or expan - sion of innovative projects in the growth phase, with re - quirements similar to the early stage that the projects have  a high return potential, high demand, and market growth.   This financing is a long term credit to investment funds and  the amount of financing provided depended on the needs of  the project and the negotiation reached (CORFO, 2012).  In  1996, CORFO started its risk capital, F1 line program which  matched every 1 peso of private money invested.  By 2005,  the results of the F1 program were disappointing as only five  venture capital funds had been created and their focus was  geared towards mature firms (Amoros, Altienza and Romani,  2008).  The same year of 2005 a second line, F2, was start - ed.  This program provided 3 pesos for each peso invested  (CORFO Interview, 2006).  In 2006, a third line F3, which  provided 3 pesos for each peso invested, was created.  The  main differentiating factor of the F3 line was a special orien - tation towards financing small businesses with high-growth  potential.  After creating these three lines, it was decided  that as a new line was created the previous line would be  closed (Echecopar, Angelelli and Galleguillos, 2006).    CORFO additionally promoted entrepreneurship
(Echecopar, Angelelli and Galleguillos, 2006).    CORFO additionally promoted entrepreneurship activities  for acceleration and internationalization of young firms.   Y oung businesses (less than 4 years old) could participate  in the International Acceleration of T echnological Entrepre - neurship- Global Connection program.  Each participating  business is allowed to appoint two representatives to partic - ipate in the incubation and/or internationalization program  (CORFO, 2012).  Angel Investors Role Another source of non-government early stage funds came  from business angels who typically invested smaller amounts  of money in the early, to early growth stages.  In some cases,  it may take 4-5 angels pooling their monies to meet the  needs of a new venture.   Octantis, located within the Ado - lfo Ibañez University, created an angel network initiative in  2003, and by 2006, the program had 100 angels subscribed in the program (Echecopar, Angelelli and Galleguillos, 2006).   Octantis has estimated that it has helped its incubatees get  US$1.2 million of angel capital (Verdugo, 2006), which is  usually invested in only a few promising companies and not  spread out across all of them.  In fact, many interviewees  felt that it was very difficult to get private/angel investment,  mostly because of the risk-averse nature of investors.  T o  facilitate growth and expansion of angel funding, the govern - ment has sponsored a national angel network, whose opera - tion and administration is being financed by CORFO.    Banking System Role   The last resource for entrepreneurs is to seek bank loans.   Banks in Chile have traditionally not been very friendly  for start-ups, usually requiring a commercial history of  activity and collateral.  The government through COR - FO launched the NACE (birth) program that offers bank  loans to new businesses at the idea development stage, or  those who have been in the market for less than two years   (Bci Empresarios, 2012). Table 1
or  those who have been in the market for less than two years   (Bci Empresarios, 2012). Table 1 illustrates the various types of financing available for  conception, early and early accelerated growth stages of a  new venture in Chile. Interaction of Government/University/Industry in  Chile Since incubators are a tool of economic development and  part of the framework conditions for entrepreneurship, gov - ernments across the world tend to invest in incubation to  various degrees.  Corporate incubation programs, still a new  concept and the purest form of industry involvement, work  with clients to meet company objectives, often to spin in in - novations or to spin out companies built around their own  research.  In addition, the role of universities is often crucial  as many incubators are either sponsored by a university or  are usually physically co-located in one.  Incubators in gen - eral use universities as a source of technology and many  seek to leverage university research efforts by providing a  path to commercialization (O’Neal, 2005).  In Chile, the government designs early stage financing instru - ments that are well-suited to market needs through a trial  and error process of giving a new instrument about a year  to study its impact and then refining it, if necessary.  The  agile, real time response to the market is unusual for govern - ment in most countries, but it appears to work well in Chile  where the government has sought out experienced industry  experts to research and develop the early stage financing  instruments (Echecopar Interview, 2006).  The government  is trying to serve as a catalyst for entrepreneurship and in - novation by starting new financing programs, restructuring  ISSN: 0718-2724.

7old ones, or acting as a facilitator between entrepreneurs  and the private industry.    While there is an overall positive perception of the new  lines of government financing for early stage ventures, an  in-depth survey of experts in Chile conducted by the Global  Entrepreneurship Monitor in 2009, indicated overwhelming - ly negative views of government programs for entrepreneur - ship, as well as its concern for developing businesses with  high growth potential (Amoros et al., 2010).  In the same  vein, interviewees also noted that CORFO had created a lot  of bureaucracy and red tape that sometimes restrained the  enthusiasm of entrepreneurs.    However, because of all of this support, CORFO is able  to mandate some rules for entrepreneurs and incubators.   CORFO states it supports projects that bring together high- growth potential with innovation and research (CORFO In - terview, 2006).  Yet, the government has not set up clear strategic goals for incubators although it used some perfor - mance indicators to evaluate them (number of incubated  companies, number of graduated companies, level of sales,  number of employees, seed capital granted to tenants, taxes  generated),  to determine future incubator funding.    University involvement in Chilean incubation efforts has  been historically very strong.  All major incubators in Chile  were either funded to some degree or work closely with  universities.  Faculty and students serve as major resources  for project development and commercialization for uni - versity related incubators in many instances.  Locating a  business incubator on campus provides a wide variety of  opportunities, like in-house technology development and  commercialization, experiential learning for students, faculty  engagement, fostering innovation and thus contributing to  economic development and society at large, partnerships  with government and industry, and finally, media attention.

10Conclusions The Chilean government has developed several lines of  funding to address early stage gaps in risk capital for new  ventures; however not enough emphasis was placed on  developing country level entrepreneurial capability.  Inter - viewees pointed out the paucity of good ideas as a major  constraint in the development of country level development  of entrepreneurship.  It has been noted that governments  that try to grow entrepreneurship by injecting risk capital  alone, when intangibles such as access to new ideas or large  market access are missing will find that the prerequisites for  growth are lacking (Venkatraman, 2004).  The cognitive en - vironment for entrepreneurship, which includes education  that is focused on how to start and manage a new venture,  and the normative framework that includes softer elements  like culture and education (Spencer and Gomez,2002) have  not been emphasized as much as hard elements of the regu - latory and formal risk capital market environment for new  venture creation.  In response to these issues, proposals  to include entrepreneurship / intellectual property related  courses into the scientific / technological curriculum, as well  as alternative degrees focused on science entrepreneurs  have been suggested (Jimenez, 2011).  Also, incubators may need to be more selective in their re - source allocation to favor the high potential incubatees to  help amplify the initial investment, as opposed to spreading  the wealth among all incubatees equitably.   For example, one  incubator interviewed had about 30 projects, out of which it  believes 6 have the highest potential for growth and returns  on investment.  However, staff in many of the incubators  normally devotes an equal amount of time and resources  to all projects, regardless of potential impact.  This situation  may need to be reconsidered, if high-growth, high perfor - mance entrepreneurship is the goal.   Currently, the average client base of Chilean
high perfor - mance entrepreneurship is the goal.   Currently, the average client base of Chilean incubators is  between 1 and 17, with a primary focus on the high value  services such as networking. Incubators in Chile appear to  be moving towards the “networked” incubator model by  which they are able to share resources and experience.  Sev - eral interviewees mentioned the bridging role of the incuba - tor.  While the different types of networks may be viewed  as intangible resources that form part of the institutional  framework conditions, the key is for incubators and other  stakeholders to leverage the power of these networks to  realize their power and potential.   Table 2 summarizes the features of Chilean business incuba - tors along key dimensions.  The Chilean government in its effort to foster new ventures  is playing dual roles on the demand and supply sides of the market to create the framework for early stage risk capital.   The government through CORFO had created a fund to  support the creation of business incubators; subsequently it  created a seed capital fund to support new ventures in these  incubators, thereby in essence creating a financial market  for startups.  The demand for funds came from the entre - preneurs sponsored by the incubators and the government  created the supply of funds to meet this demand. The gov - ernment also supported the creation of an angel network in  2005 to help jump start the creation of an angel market, a  key source of funds for early stage ventures (Echecopar et  al., 2012).   However, in spite of these efforts at risk capital market crea - tion by stoking both demand and supply of capital, there is  no clear and firm innovation policy at the macro-level, with  each successive government pushing its own support pro - grams that change with the arrival of a new president (Jime - nez, 2011).  In addition, government financing opportunities  are dispersed through several institutions with very little
government financing opportunities  are dispersed through several institutions with very little  coordination amongst them, creating a confusing array of  options (Amoros et al., 2010).  At the incubator level, there  is no clear system for evaluating the performance of incuba - tors in terms of the number of businesses incubated and  their levels of success, since formal data is lacking in these  areas (Jimenez, 2011).  Over time, the question of incubator  self-sustainability and performance need to be addressed, as  government support wanes in the context of a growing in - cubation market space in Chile.  Chilean incubation is still in  its nascent stages with much support from the triple helix  of government, academia and industry.  Yet, and in order to  support  the growth of innovative, high impact new ventures  these critical issues may need to be addressed in the short  term to ensure robust growth of incubation in Chile.

Chilean business incubators tend to capitalize on regional resource strengths  and have a strategic focus on high growth, high innovation, high impact businesses as a result of a government mandate to  focus on developing business with high potential for economic development and job creation.  The government’s efforts to  create the framework conditions for entrepreneurship by investing in business incubators, organizing risk capital for early  stage ventures to fill capital market gaps and support for angel networks as well as incubator funding are discussed. Policy  implications for the continued growth of the incubation industry are provided.

2Business Incubation in Chile:  Development, Financing and Financial Services Business incubators which  provide fertile environments for  new ventures are relatively new hybrid organizational enti - ties that could be viewed as  part of a country’s institutional  ecosystem or entrepreneurial framework conditions (EFCs)  that constitute   resources, as well as supporting market and  regulatory institutions  (Bosma et al., 2008; Isenberg, 2010)   to transition Chile from an efficiency-driven to innovation- driven stage of economic growth (Porter, Sachs and Arthur,  2002) marked by knowledge spillovers (Acs and Amoros,  2008) and high growth, scalable entrepreneurship.  Business  incubators develop networks of multiplex ties with a range  of actors that offer financial, human and social capital (Mian,  1997).   These incubator networks in turn add value by cre - ating institutionalized structures for resource and knowl - edge transfer that benefit the young incubatee firm (Hansen  et al., 2000).  A majority of business incubators around the  world are run as non-profits sustained by plural sources of  funds from the government as well as nominal rents and  fees charged to in-house client firms.  Given their non-profit  business model and lack of self-sustainability, set in a context  of thin or non-existent capital markets government funding  and support plays a major role in incubator and incubatee  financial support. Over the past two decades, governments have viewed busi - ness incubators as tools of addressing market failure to ame - liorate the twin liabilities of newness and lack of visibility  for new ventures (Bollingtoft and Ulhoi, 2005), bestowing  financial support for both incubator and client firms housed  in incubators.  Governments in Latin America and most no - tably in Chile, which has a nascent incubation market, are  developing publicly funded programs in the context of a de - veloping incubation market space with a view to promoting  a better
in the context of a de - veloping incubation market space with a view to promoting  a better institutional environment for innovative entrepre - neurship (Echecopar, 2004) in addition to dismantling several  institutional barriers constraining equity funding (Amoros,  Felzensztein and Gimmon, 2010).  Age and stage of develop - ment determine a new venture’s capital needs (Shane, 2008);  in Chile early stage new ventures face equity gaps, that cover  funds that are too large for the 3F’s, but too small for formal  venture capital (Amoros, Altienza and Romani, 2008).  Chile,  like many Latin American countries tends to have high rates  of “necessity” based entrepreneurs (Bosma and Levie, 2010)  which could be a function of the stage of economic develop - ment as well as a by-product of weak institutional environ - ments that is more likely to foster the growth of survival  scale entrepreneurs (De Soto, 1989). The focus of this paper is on the business incubator market  space in Chile with an emphasis on the ways in which the  triple helix of government, universities and industry work together to support incubator development.   The introduc - tory section of the paper is followed by a method section  describing the qualitative data collection methods followed  by a review of institutional theory and network theory as  it pertains to entrepreneurship development and incubator  networks. Incubator development and growth, funding struc - ture and early stage financing available for new ventures are  discussed in the following sections with an emphasis on the  rich interplay of the triple helix of government, industry and  academia in creating the institutional framework conditions  for entrepreneurship, especially in the area of early stage  risk capital for young ventures.  Findings and policy recom - mendations regarding incubator development in Chile are  discussed in the concluding section.   Method The paper is based on research that represents findings  from seven
concluding section.   Method The paper is based on research that represents findings  from seven structured, on-site interviews conducted with  key business incubator stakeholders in Chile.  Incubator  managers and staff, policy makers and academics were in - terviewed for this study.  The interview instrument for the  semi-structured, in-depth interviews was developed after a  thorough literature review and revised on the basis of pi - lot interviews conducted in the United States, as well as  the authors’ experience gained from similar interviews in  the United States, Thailand, China and India.  The pilot in - terviews served as a pre-test for instrument validation and  changes were made to the interview instrument based on  the findings and comments.  The instrument was pre-tested  and adapted to the Chilean environment by scholars and  consultants with extensive experience in Latin America. The  instrument was first translated from English into Spanish  and then translated back by a Spanish-speaking colleague. It  was then proofread and modified by another native Spanish  speaker from an academic environment to ensure the ac - curacy of translation.  The semi-structured interview format  was selected, since this modality provides for focused and  systematic information collection, while allowing the inter - viewee to provide relevant contextual information appropri - ate to each case.  Institutional Theory and Entrepreneurship   in Chile Governments around the world support entrepreneurship  through policies that are conducive to the creation of an  overall environment for new venture creation (Lerner, 2009)  since innovation by new ventures has been linked to eco - nomic growth and job creation (Acs and Audretsch, 1988;  Thurik and Wennekers, 2004).  Many new ventures fail due  to paucity of risk capital, the life blood of  high potential  new ventures that start  with voracious capital requirements  particularly in their early stages when mortality rates are

3highest; hence capital markets are an integral part of creat - ing an entrepreneurship ecosystem (Isenberg, 2010).  Gaps  in the market for risk capital to fuel this growth is all too  common in developed and developing countries, hence this  gap in the financing chain for new ventures and its impact on  firm survival is well documented (Acs, 2006).  Governments  play a key role in shaping the institutional ecosystem for cap - ital markets with institutional theory arguing for the impor - tance of strong market institutions to support the growth  of capital markets (Lerner, 2009).  Weak, fragmented or con - straining institutional environments in incipient markets may  lead to market failure (Easterly, 2006) and consequent loss  of positive spillovers or contagion effects from innovative  young firms.  Governments with deeper and more powerful  resources can address market failure caused by institutional  voids in risk capital markets (Mair and Marti, 2009) through  public policies designed to provide early stage financing  (Storey, 2005) to fill the funding gap, in spite of arguments  against government intervention or government failure lead - ing to inefficient use of funds from the public purse (Storey,  2005; De Meza, 2002).  Network Theory and Business Incubators   in Chile Business incubators in Chile focus on internal and exter - nal networking, assisting incubatees with finding funding, and  connecting incubatees to a range of actors to facilitate re - source and knowledge flows.  Fluid, dynamic and multiplex    networks between the incubator and its partners allow ran - dom and multiple points of contact creating both strong and  weak ties (Granovetter, 1973) that enable access to novel  ideas, knowledge transfer and learning across the network  (Rangan, 2000), in addition to facilitating resource acquisi - tion and opportunity exploitation by entrepreneurial actors  by connecting them with resource providers (Aldrich and  Wiedenmayer, 1993).
actors  by connecting them with resource providers (Aldrich and  Wiedenmayer, 1993).  Public-private partnerships forged by  the business incubator create a web of relationships with  the capacity for influencing the broader business environ - ment.  For instance, partners from the financial community  may enhance client access to various types of early stage  financing (Ayers and Harman, 2009).  Networking benefits  include knowledge spillovers as well as access to business  angels, who not only provide capital, but also experience  and contacts to firms crossing dangerous “death valleys”  (Bygrave and Quill, 2007).  In addition, a strong angel net - work that brings funding at the pre-venture capital stage is  complementary to the more formal funding that a firm is  expected to need as it matures (Harrison and Mason, 2000). Growth and development of business   incubators in Chile Chile has a nascent, but growing business incubation indus - try with approximately 27 incubators (CORFO, 2012), mak - ing it the second largest incubation market in South America  after Brazil.  Out of the 27 incubators, 17 are operational  with 10 in the process of creation.  Since the early 1990s,  the government has been investing heavily in business in - cubators to promote entrepreneurship.  While government  support of incubation in Chile is fairly ubiquitous, universi - ties also play an important role by providing education and  training, R&D transfer and other in-kind support, along with  private investors, in creating a healthy innovation ecosys - tem to foster new venture creation and growth.  Santiago  Innova, the first incubator in Chile, was started in 1992 by  the municipal government of Santiago, with the objective of  creating jobs for the local economy (Santiago Innova Inter - view, 2009).  Though still relatively small in number when  compared to Brazil’s 400-plus incubators, the Chilean model  of incubation represents a concerted effort by government,  universities
the Chilean model  of incubation represents a concerted effort by government,  universities and industry to foster new ventures through a  systematic and well-organized institutional infrastructure,  with noteworthy attempts by government to organize risk  capital for early stage financing of new ventures, as well as  different types of support for incubator funding and angel  network development. Chile INCUBA, a trade association of business incubators  serves as a representative voice for business incubators  in Chile and the Chilean Economic Development Agency  (CORFO), the government agency that deals with small busi - ness and entrepreneurship provide various types of financial  support for incubators and incubatees.  The focus of Chil - ean incubators is on a wide variety of industries, with two  particular things in common: high growth (i.e. doubling its  sales per year) and innovation in products, services, or busi - ness model (Octantis Interview, 2006).  The incubators are  distributed geographically throughout Chile, so that every  region has the capacity, resources, and expertise to support  a potentially high-impact and creative business. Because in - novation and high growth are CORFO’s mandates (CORFO  Interview, 2006), all formal Chilean incubators, which are fi - nanced primarily through CORFO, usually look for projects  that will satisfy these two requirements.  In this context,  innovation is defined in rather broad terms and does not  have to be high-tech; innovation can be demonstrated in  products, services, or business models.  While the primary  focus is on fostering innovative companies with high growth  potential, the government also looks for economic impact in  terms of job creation in economically disadvantaged regions.  Incubators in Chile add value to client firms by acting as  intermediary between the government or private sector  participants and entrepreneurs.  They are currently grap - ISSN: 0718-2724.

4pling with issues related to their strategic focus, nature of  incubation in terms of general versus specialized focus, and  questions related to self-sustainability and length of govern - ment support.   Performance criteria such as the number of  incubated companies, number of successful graduates and  number of employees, level of sales / tax revenue generated  of incubate and graduated firms are typically used to assess  incubator performance (CORFO Interview, 2006). Business Incubator Service Profile in Chile Chilean incubators seek to promote job creation, economic  development, innovation, and high growth by providing a  wide variety of services that are typical to most incuba - tors: physical space and infrastructure, business consulting  and training, help with funding applications (government and  private), patenting assistance and IP protection, technology  transfer, and networking.  All Chilean incubators provided  basic administrative services (office space, infrastructure,  secretarial and administrative services).  However, incuba - tors tended to emphasize high value services such as con - sulting, training and networking.  However, the major focus of Chilean incubators is on net - working.  This is often done informally as incubators host  breakfast meetings with industry experts or bring in pro - fessionals to mentor their clients.  Often this is of critical  importance because these experts provide an objective ex - pert assessment of the business idea.  Moreover, these con - nections have potential to lead to new market access, sup - plier contacts, or even subcontracting.   Internal networking  among client firms as well as networking through Chile In - cuba was found to be prevalent (Octantis Interview, 2006).   Sources of Incubator Support/Funding Business incubators typically utilize a combination of three  types of revenue models (infoDev Incubator Support Cent - er, 2007).  The first revenue model incorporates the rev - enue from rental
Support Cent - er, 2007).  The first revenue model incorporates the rev - enue from rental income from tenants and other revenues  derived from client fees for consulting and other services.   This “landlord” model can be financially self-sufficient, given  “free” buildings and minimum economies of scale.  The sec - ond revenue model involves the incubator taking an equity  position in its more promising client firms and has the po - tential to generate revenues from sharing in client success  or royalty agreements on gross sales and brokerage fees  on raising finance.  This method however requires substan - tial initial investment and a great deal of patience, as it may  take up to 10 years to generate revenues.  The third, and  most common, method is to rely on an ongoing sponsor  funding, such as the university, government at the federal /  state / local levels, of private foundation or industry support   (Lalkaka, 2001). Almost all business incubators in Chile are funded primarily  by a coalition of the government, universities, private insti - tutions, or research centers, with government footing the  lion’s share of the costs of incubator setup and ongoing sup - port through different dedicated lines of funding to support  the life cycle financial needs of the incubators. CORFO cur - rently offers a line of funds to support incubator operation  and management that subsidizes up to 65% of total project  cost or a maximum of US$450,000 approximately at cur - rent exchange rates, that is open to new as well as existing  incubators that have previously received government fund - ing through the Development and Innovation Fund (Fondo  de Desarollo e Innovación – FDI) or from the InnovaChile  committee. University sponsorship includes both tangible  and intangible support in the form of physical space, infra - structure, access to faculty and students, and in-kind ser - vices.  The majority of incubators are physically located on  university campuses to gain access --- 5a combination of public/private support as with Octantis at  the Adolfo Ibanez University in Santiago, and DICTUC at  the Pontifical Catholic University in Santiago, Chile.  Another  incubator, the Iner los Lagos, redefined its financing strategy  by the end of 2010.  These changes allowed it to raise $1  million dollars in 2011, with70% of these funds coming from  the public sector and 30% from the private sector (ChileIn - cuba, 2012). The Chilean incubator funding model indicated that incu - bators combine various revenue streams, relying mostly on  government ongoing support (in many cases for up to 80%),  but they also incorporated nominal rental and incubation  service fees, with some taking  equity positions in their client  companies to generate funds for ongoing operations.  Sourc - es of revenue for incubators in Chile included rental fees,  which provided a steady source of financial support in most  cases.  For example, AccessNova charged tenants a monthly  nominal fee equal to US$350 for physical infrastructure and  services (AccessNova Interview, 2006).  Octantis also calcu - lated direct costs and spread them into monthly payments  for companies (Octantis Interview, 2006).  Another revenue  source for incubators, albeit a long-term one is taking an  equity share in their promising incubatees.  These were long- term assets, since it typically took up to 10 years to realize  returns, and a portfolio of at least 20 companies to spread  the risk (infoDev Incubator Support Center, 2007).  Incuba - tors in Chile often took between 10% (Ventana) and 35%  (DICTUC) of an equity share.  However, incubator managers  realized that most of these investments may never realize a  return on investment (Ventana Interview, 2006).  Financing New Ventures / Incubatees and Risk Capi - tal Infrastructure Entrepreneurs face a critical phase in the development of  a new business during the initial stages. Early concept stage  seed capital typically came from personal funds,
- vices.  The majority of incubators are physically located on  university campuses to gain access to university expertise  and resources.  Private funding, has been relatively rare, has  been increasing of late with Octantis receiving about $6.5  million from private funds (Rios, 2011).  Private funds also  come usually from companies who hope later to acquire  some of the technologies developed by new ventures at the  incubators (CORFO, 2012). The Chilean incubation system utilizes a multi-tiered ap - proach to incubator models focused on: 1) high growth, high  impact, scalable ventures, 2) technological innovation, and  3) regional focus or generalist incubators whose primary  emphasis is job creation and local economic development  (CORFO Interview, 2006).   Of late, the government through  CORFO has been encouraging incubators to define their  own particular profile: innovative (high entrepreneurship  potential) or traditional (local impact) based on local condi - tions and internal criteria, such as the type of incubatee firm  (Rios, 2011). All interviewed incubator managers emphasized the tre - mendous role of government funding through CORFO.  For  instance, Octantis, the best known Chilean incubator, re - ceived as much as 80% of its budget from CORFO through  a government program (Octantis Interview, 2006).  In other  cases there were plural sources of support, i.e. strong uni - versity sponsors, as in the case of DICTUC at Catholic Uni - versity, where almost 35% is sponsored by CORFO (DIC - TUC Interview, 2006).  In another case, the Access Nova  incubator is fully owned by the University, but it still received  some funding from the government (Access Nova Interview,  2006).  Many incubators were able to raise other kinds of  funding from various sources to complement government  support, private funds in the case of Ventana at the Catho - lic University in Santiago, and the incubator at Arturo Prat  University in Iquique, infoDev (World Bank), grants

during the initial stages. Early concept stage  seed capital typically came from personal funds, government  funds and angel investors (Amoros et al., 2010).  The Chilean  government in an effort to fill the gaps in the financing cycle  has taken an active role by offering seed and risk capital lines  through CORFO to support its broader mission of creating  innovative new businesses by connecting new business op - portunities with financing.  Through CORFO’s Innova Chile  program, it provided various lines of seed capital or smart  capital for new ventures sponsored by business incubators,  universities or industry groups (CORFO Interview, 2006).  In  addition, the government has worked with banks to create  the NACE fund to provide early stage funding that does not  require collateral.  Angel investors were another source of  seed capital; however they tended to support growth stage,  income generating projects that were not too risky.  Dur - ing the later phases of early growth and accelerated growth  stages, the government has designed risk capital funds that support these stages via co-investment  instruments  designed by CORFO that have effectively attracted more  private capital (Amoros et al., 2010).  Finally, entrepreneurs  tried to access bank loans at the later stages of growth after  establishing a track record. Seed Capital for Early Stage The seed capital program (Capital Semilla) developed by  CORFO, is  aimed at supporting  new ventures in the idea  stage for help with business plan development and  activities  associated with  initiation of operations (Echecopar, Angele - lli and Galleguillos, 2006).  The two lines of funding in the  seed capital program, L1 and L2, have been replaced with  a single Seed Capital Program in 2011, which is based on a  new policy of “rewards” that depends on the “milestones”  achieved by the projects supported by the incubators, such  as increase in sales (Rios, 2011).  In addition, access to the  seed funds is
the incubators, such  as increase in sales (Rios, 2011).  In addition, access to the  seed funds is contingent on sponsorship either by an incu - bator or a related institution (Echecopar, Angelelli and Gal - leguillos, 2006).  CORFO has also created a seed fund of flexible assignation  (SSFA) (Subsidio Semilla de Asignación Flexible-SSAF). This  tool allowed the incubators to access funds from a sort of  checking account to be used for their incubated projects.   These resources are earmarked for exclusive use for incu - batee projects and may not be used for the incubators’ own  purposes (CORFO, 2012).  IncubaUC, an incubator of the  Pontifical Catholic University in Chile expects this program  to support innovative entrepreneurs with high risk projects  to develop their business in the early stages of their crea - tion (ChileIncuba, 2012).  The government has also devel - oped a T echnology Package Program for new businesses  (Empaquetamiento T ecnológico para nuevos Negocios), to  support the technological development of sophisticated  businesses with high growth potential and a proven com - mercial opportunity (CORFO, 2012).  Lack of an entrepreneurial culture in the scientific and tech - nological community in Chile is recognized as one of the  major barriers to the transfer of basic research into com - mercial products (Jimenez, 2011).  T o address this issue in  Chile, the government has created other funds, including  FONDEF under CONICYT (FONDEF , 2012), the Nation - al Commission for Scientific and T echnological Innovation,  which is focused on the development of human capital to  advance technological innovation. Recently, CONICYT,  through FONDEF has launched a contest to evaluate re - search conducted in universities with the objective of trans - lating this research into new businesses to address the is - sue of paucity of entrepreneurial culture in the scientific/  technological community.

6Chile, a “privately owned, non-profit institution, created in  1976 by the Government of Chile and ITT Corporation of  the United States” (Fundación Chile, 2012).  Fundación Chile  has one of the initiatives to finance projects during the early  growth stage through its own risk capital fund (Echecopar,  Angelelli and Galleguillos, 2006).     Risk Capital for growth stage By the time entrepreneurs have a  product prototype and  have started operations, the new venture requires another  injection of capital for the next phase of its growth and gov - ernment funds fill the gap at this stage as well (Echecopar,  Angelelli and Galleguillos, 2006).  Risk Capital for Innovative  Businesses program was devoted to the creation or expan - sion of innovative projects in the growth phase, with re - quirements similar to the early stage that the projects have  a high return potential, high demand, and market growth.   This financing is a long term credit to investment funds and  the amount of financing provided depended on the needs of  the project and the negotiation reached (CORFO, 2012).  In  1996, CORFO started its risk capital, F1 line program which  matched every 1 peso of private money invested.  By 2005,  the results of the F1 program were disappointing as only five  venture capital funds had been created and their focus was  geared towards mature firms (Amoros, Altienza and Romani,  2008).  The same year of 2005 a second line, F2, was start - ed.  This program provided 3 pesos for each peso invested  (CORFO Interview, 2006).  In 2006, a third line F3, which  provided 3 pesos for each peso invested, was created.  The  main differentiating factor of the F3 line was a special orien - tation towards financing small businesses with high-growth  potential.  After creating these three lines, it was decided  that as a new line was created the previous line would be  closed (Echecopar, Angelelli and Galleguillos, 2006).    CORFO additionally promoted entrepreneurship --- (Echecopar, Angelelli and Galleguillos, 2006).    CORFO additionally promoted entrepreneurship activities  for acceleration and internationalization of young firms.   Y oung businesses (less than 4 years old) could participate  in the International Acceleration of T echnological Entrepre - neurship- Global Connection program.  Each participating  business is allowed to appoint two representatives to partic - ipate in the incubation and/or internationalization program  (CORFO, 2012).  Angel Investors Role Another source of non-government early stage funds came  from business angels who typically invested smaller amounts  of money in the early, to early growth stages.  In some cases,  it may take 4-5 angels pooling their monies to meet the  needs of a new venture.   Octantis, located within the Ado - lfo Ibañez University, created an angel network initiative in  2003, and by 2006, the program had 100 angels subscribed in the program (Echecopar, Angelelli and Galleguillos, 2006).   Octantis has estimated that it has helped its incubatees get  US$1.2 million of angel capital (Verdugo, 2006), which is  usually invested in only a few promising companies and not  spread out across all of them.  In fact, many interviewees  felt that it was very difficult to get private/angel investment,  mostly because of the risk-averse nature of investors.  T o  facilitate growth and expansion of angel funding, the govern - ment has sponsored a national angel network, whose opera - tion and administration is being financed by CORFO.    Banking System Role   The last resource for entrepreneurs is to seek bank loans.   Banks in Chile have traditionally not been very friendly  for start-ups, usually requiring a commercial history of  activity and collateral.  The government through COR - FO launched the NACE (birth) program that offers bank  loans to new businesses at the idea development stage, or  those who have been in the market for less than two years   (Bci Empresarios, 2012). Table 1
or  those who have been in the market for less than two years   (Bci Empresarios, 2012). Table 1 illustrates the various types of financing available for  conception, early and early accelerated growth stages of a  new venture in Chile. Interaction of Government/University/Industry in  Chile Since incubators are a tool of economic development and  part of the framework conditions for entrepreneurship, gov - ernments across the world tend to invest in incubation to  various degrees.  Corporate incubation programs, still a new  concept and the purest form of industry involvement, work  with clients to meet company objectives, often to spin in in - novations or to spin out companies built around their own  research.  In addition, the role of universities is often crucial  as many incubators are either sponsored by a university or  are usually physically co-located in one.  Incubators in gen - eral use universities as a source of technology and many  seek to leverage university research efforts by providing a  path to commercialization (O’Neal, 2005).  In Chile, the government designs early stage financing instru - ments that are well-suited to market needs through a trial  and error process of giving a new instrument about a year  to study its impact and then refining it, if necessary.  The  agile, real time response to the market is unusual for govern - ment in most countries, but it appears to work well in Chile  where the government has sought out experienced industry  experts to research and develop the early stage financing  instruments (Echecopar Interview, 2006).  The government  is trying to serve as a catalyst for entrepreneurship and in - novation by starting new financing programs, restructuring  ISSN: 0718-2724.

7old ones, or acting as a facilitator between entrepreneurs  and the private industry.    While there is an overall positive perception of the new  lines of government financing for early stage ventures, an  in-depth survey of experts in Chile conducted by the Global  Entrepreneurship Monitor in 2009, indicated overwhelming - ly negative views of government programs for entrepreneur - ship, as well as its concern for developing businesses with  high growth potential (Amoros et al., 2010).  In the same  vein, interviewees also noted that CORFO had created a lot  of bureaucracy and red tape that sometimes restrained the  enthusiasm of entrepreneurs.    However, because of all of this support, CORFO is able  to mandate some rules for entrepreneurs and incubators.   CORFO states it supports projects that bring together high- growth potential with innovation and research (CORFO In - terview, 2006).  Yet, the government has not set up clear strategic goals for incubators although it used some perfor - mance indicators to evaluate them (number of incubated  companies, number of graduated companies, level of sales,  number of employees, seed capital granted to tenants, taxes  generated),  to determine future incubator funding.    University involvement in Chilean incubation efforts has  been historically very strong.  All major incubators in Chile  were either funded to some degree or work closely with  universities.  Faculty and students serve as major resources  for project development and commercialization for uni - versity related incubators in many instances.  Locating a  business incubator on campus provides a wide variety of  opportunities, like in-house technology development and  commercialization, experiential learning for students, faculty  engagement, fostering innovation and thus contributing to  economic development and society at large, partnerships  with government and industry, and finally, media attention.

10Conclusions The Chilean government has developed several lines of  funding to address early stage gaps in risk capital for new  ventures; however not enough emphasis was placed on  developing country level entrepreneurial capability.  Inter - viewees pointed out the paucity of good ideas as a major  constraint in the development of country level development  of entrepreneurship.  It has been noted that governments  that try to grow entrepreneurship by injecting risk capital  alone, when intangibles such as access to new ideas or large  market access are missing will find that the prerequisites for  growth are lacking (Venkatraman, 2004).  The cognitive en - vironment for entrepreneurship, which includes education  that is focused on how to start and manage a new venture,  and the normative framework that includes softer elements  like culture and education (Spencer and Gomez,2002) have  not been emphasized as much as hard elements of the regu - latory and formal risk capital market environment for new  venture creation.  In response to these issues, proposals  to include entrepreneurship / intellectual property related  courses into the scientific / technological curriculum, as well  as alternative degrees focused on science entrepreneurs  have been suggested (Jimenez, 2011).  Also, incubators may need to be more selective in their re - source allocation to favor the high potential incubatees to  help amplify the initial investment, as opposed to spreading  the wealth among all incubatees equitably.   For example, one  incubator interviewed had about 30 projects, out of which it  believes 6 have the highest potential for growth and returns  on investment.  However, staff in many of the incubators  normally devotes an equal amount of time and resources  to all projects, regardless of potential impact.  This situation  may need to be reconsidered, if high-growth, high perfor - mance entrepreneurship is the goal.   Currently, the average client base of Chilean
high perfor - mance entrepreneurship is the goal.   Currently, the average client base of Chilean incubators is  between 1 and 17, with a primary focus on the high value  services such as networking. Incubators in Chile appear to  be moving towards the “networked” incubator model by  which they are able to share resources and experience.  Sev - eral interviewees mentioned the bridging role of the incuba - tor.  While the different types of networks may be viewed  as intangible resources that form part of the institutional  framework conditions, the key is for incubators and other  stakeholders to leverage the power of these networks to  realize their power and potential.   Table 2 summarizes the features of Chilean business incuba - tors along key dimensions.  The Chilean government in its effort to foster new ventures  is playing dual roles on the demand and supply sides of the market to create the framework for early stage risk capital.   The government through CORFO had created a fund to  support the creation of business incubators; subsequently it  created a seed capital fund to support new ventures in these  incubators, thereby in essence creating a financial market  for startups.  The demand for funds came from the entre - preneurs sponsored by the incubators and the government  created the supply of funds to meet this demand. The gov - ernment also supported the creation of an angel network in  2005 to help jump start the creation of an angel market, a  key source of funds for early stage ventures (Echecopar et  al., 2012).   However, in spite of these efforts at risk capital market crea - tion by stoking both demand and supply of capital, there is  no clear and firm innovation policy at the macro-level, with  each successive government pushing its own support pro - grams that change with the arrival of a new president (Jime - nez, 2011).  In addition, government financing opportunities  are dispersed through several institutions with very little
government financing opportunities  are dispersed through several institutions with very little  coordination amongst them, creating a confusing array of  options (Amoros et al., 2010).  At the incubator level, there  is no clear system for evaluating the performance of incuba - tors in terms of the number of businesses incubated and  their levels of success, since formal data is lacking in these  areas (Jimenez, 2011).  Over time, the question of incubator  self-sustainability and performance need to be addressed, as  government support wanes in the context of a growing in - cubation market space in Chile.  Chilean incubation is still in  its nascent stages with much support from the triple helix  of government, academia and industry.  Yet, and in order to  support  the growth of innovative, high impact new ventures  these critical issues may need to be addressed in the short  term to ensure robust growth of incubation in Chile.

El artículo titulado "Business Incubation in Chile: Development, Financing and Financial Services", escrito por Aruna Chandra y Maria Alejandra Medrano Silva, fue recibido el 30 de marzo de 2012, aceptado el 13 de junio de 2012 y publicado en el volumen 7, número 2 del *Journal of Technology Management and Innovation*. Este estudio examina el estado actual de la incubación de negocios en Chile, un sector que se encuentra en sus etapas iniciales, con aproximadamente 27 incubadoras operativas, principalmente apoyadas por una coalición de entidades gubernamentales y universidades.

### Contexto y Objetivos
Los autores destacan que el enfoque estratégico de las incubadoras chilenas se centra en aprovechar los recursos regionales y fomentar empresas con alto potencial de crecimiento e innovación, en respuesta a un mandato gubernamental que busca impulsar el desarrollo económico y la creación de empleo. El artículo también analiza los esfuerzos del gobierno chileno para crear un entorno propicio para el emprendimiento, incluyendo inversiones en incubadoras, organización de capital de riesgo, y apoyo a redes de ángeles inversionistas.

### Implicaciones Políticas
Se discuten las implicaciones políticas para el crecimiento de la industria de incubación en Chile, sugiriendo que el desarrollo de políticas adecuadas es crucial para la sostenibilidad de estas incubadoras. Los autores agradecen el apoyo recibido de Networks Financial Institute y de Indiana State University, así como de varias personas en Chile que contribuyeron a la investigación.

### Teorías y Metodología
El artículo se enmarca dentro de teorías institucionales y de redes, utilizando palabras clave como incubación en Chile, capital de riesgo, nuevas empresas y servicios financieros de incubadoras. Se menciona que las incubadoras son fundamentales para proporcionar un entorno fértil para nuevas empresas, facilitando la transferencia de recursos y conocimientos, lo que fomenta el crecimiento empresarial escalable y la generación de "spillovers" de conocimiento.

### Estructura y Contenido
El texto se estructura en varias secciones, comenzando con una introducción, seguida de una descripción de los métodos de recolección de datos cualitativos, y una revisión de teorías institucionales y de redes. Se discuten el desarrollo y crecimiento de las incubadoras, la estructura de financiación y la financiación en etapas tempranas disponible para nuevas empresas, enfatizando la interacción entre el gobierno, la industria y la academia.

### Hallazgos y Recomendaciones
Los hallazgos y recomendaciones de políticas sobre el desarrollo de incubadoras en Chile se presentan en la sección de conclusiones. La investigación se basa en siete entrevistas estructuradas con actores clave de incubadoras de negocios en Chile, incluyendo gerentes, formuladores de políticas y académicos. Se utilizó un instrumento de entrevista semi-estructurado, validado a través de entrevistas piloto en Estados Unidos y adaptado al contexto chileno.

### Desafíos y Oportunidades
El texto destaca que las nuevas empresas en etapas tempranas enfrentan brechas de capital, ya que requieren montos que son demasiado grandes para los fondos de "3F" (friends, family, and fools), pero demasiado pequeños para el capital de riesgo formal. Se menciona que Chile presenta altas tasas de emprendedores "por necesidad", lo que puede estar relacionado con un entorno institucional débil.

### Modelos de Ingresos y Financiamiento
Se identifican tres modelos principales de generación de ingresos para incubadoras: el modelo de "propietario", el modelo de participación en capital y el modelo de financiamiento por patrocinadores. La mayoría de las incubadoras en Chile son financiadas por una combinación de fondos gubernamentales y tarifas cobradas a las empresas que utilizan sus servicios.

### Conclusiones
El texto concluye que las incubadoras de negocios en Chile son esenciales para el desarrollo de un ecosistema emprendedor más sólido, apoyadas por el financiamiento gubernamental y la creación de redes que facilitan el acceso a recursos y conocimientos. Se enfatiza la importancia de un enfoque integral que no solo incluya financiamiento, sino también un fortalecimiento de la educación y la cultura emprendedora.

### Referencias
El artículo se enmarca dentro de un contexto académico, con referencias a diversas investigaciones sobre el emprendimiento y la innovación en América Latina, destacando la importancia de las políticas públicas y el apoyo institucional en el desarrollo de nuevas empresas. Se menciona la relevancia de la colaboración entre el gobierno, universidades e industria para fomentar un entorno propicio para el emprendimiento.

En resumen, el estudio proporciona una visión integral sobre el panorama de la incubación de negocios en Chile, resaltando tanto los desafíos como las oportunidades en este campo emergente, y subrayando la necesidad de un enfoque colaborativo y estratégico para el desarrollo del ecosistema emprendedor.
