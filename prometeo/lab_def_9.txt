Experiential learning –a systematic review and revision of Kolb ’s model Thomas Howard Morris Department of Adult and Vocational Education, Technische Universität Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany ABSTRACT Kolb’s experiential learning cycle is perhaps the most scholarly in ﬂuential and cited model regarding experiential learning theory. However, a key issue in interpreting Kolb ’s model concerns a lack of clarity regarding what constitutes a concrete experience , exactly. A systematic literature review was conducted in order to examine: what constitutes a concreteexperience and what is the nature of treatment of a concrete experience in experiential learning? The analysis revealed ﬁve themes: learners are involved, active, participants; knowledge is situated in place and time;learners are exposed to novel experiences, which involves risk; learningdemands inquiry to speci ﬁc real-world problems; and critical re ﬂection acts as a mediator of meaningful learning. Accordingly, a revision toKolb’s model is proposed: experiential learning consists of contextually richconcrete experience, critical reﬂective observation, contextual-speci ﬁc abstract conceptualization, and pragmatic active experimentation. Further empirical studies are required to test the model proposed.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 29 May 2018 Accepted 20 November 2018 KEYWORDS Experiential learning theory; experiential learning cycle; concrete experience; criticaltheory; systematic literaturereview; teaching and education 1. Introduction What is fascinating about learning is that it cannot occur without experience . Imagine trying to learn to tie shoelaces without having the practical experience of having hands-on laces. On the other hand, try to forget your knowledge of how to ride a bike. Perhaps most notably, John Dewey (1938/ 1963 ) proposed that although not all experiences are equally educative, “all genuine education comes about through experience ”(p. 25). Experiential learning theory takes a
genuine education comes about through experience ”(p. 25). Experiential learning theory takes a fundamentally di ﬀerent view of the learning process in com- parison to behavioral learning theory. It places life experience as a central and necessary part of the learning process, where “knowledge is created through the transformation of experience ”(D. A. Kolb, 2015 , p. 49; emphasis in original). However, relatively little empirical research has been conducted on experiential learning (Bergsteiner, Avery, & Neumann, 2010 ; Jarvis, 2012 ). Nonetheless, according to D. A. Kolb ( 2015 ), over the past 20 years research on experiential learn- ing has more than quadrupled in many ﬁelds such as management, education, information science, psychology, medicine, nursing, accounting, and law. This includes a renewed interest in and attentionto employing experiential learning in formal educational settings, especially in Higher Education. Thus, furthering our understanding of the concept of experiential learning and how to facilitate it is an important area for research, especially given the limitations of experiential learning theory high-lighted in the following section. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis GroupCONTACT Thomas Howard Morris thomas.morris@sowi.uni-kl.deINTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 2020, VOL. 28, NO. 8, 1064 –1077 https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2019.1570279
2. Kolb ’s experiential learning cycle D. A. Kolb ’s(1984 ) experiential learning cycle remains the most widely inﬂ uential and cited model, or “clearest expression ”, of experiential learning theory (Seaman, Brown, & Quay, 2017 , p. 3). Kolb ( 1984 ) theorized that, Learners, if they are to be e ﬀective, need four di ﬀerent kinds of abilities —concrete experience abilities (CE), reﬂec- tive observation abilities (RO), abstract conceptualization abilities (AC), and active experimentation (AE) abilities. That is, they must be able to involve themselves fully, openly, and without bias in new experiences (CE). They must be able to reﬂ ect on and observe their experiences from many perspectives (RO). They must be able to create concepts that integrate their observations into logically sound theories (AC), and they must be able touse these theories to make decisions and solve problems (AE). (p. 30; emphasis in original) More than thirty years onwards, D. A. Kolb ( 2015 ) defended his theoretical position against a multi- tude of critiques (e.g. Bergsteiner et al., 2010 ; Bergsteiner & Avery, 2014 ; Jarvis, 2012 ; Miettinen, 2000 ; Schenck & Cruickshank, 2015 ) that the experiential learning process consists of, a four-stage cycle involving four adaptive learning modes (p. 66) …[where] Learning arises from the resol- ution of creative tension among these four learning modes. This process is portrayed as an idealized learn-ing cycle or spiral where the learner “touches all the bases ”–experiencing (CE), re ﬂecting (RO), thinking (AC), and acting (AE) –in a recursive process that is sensitive to the learning situation and what is being learned. (p. 51) Kolb acknowledged that he discovered or “noticed the dimensions ”(D. A. Kolb, 2015 , p. 56) of the theory in the works of prominent twentieth-century scholars Kurt Lewin, John Dewey, and Jean Piaget and attempted to “integrate the common themes in their work into a systematic framework that can address twenty- ﬁrst century
the common themes in their work into a systematic framework that can address twenty- ﬁrst century problems of learning and education ”(p. xvii). Intertwined with experiential learning theory is the concept of learning styles (outside the scope of the present paper;refer to A. Y. Kolb & Kolb, 2013 , for review; Schenck & Cruickshank, 2015 , for critique). A damming critique of experiential learning theory is that it lacks sound theoretical and empiri- cal foundations (cf. Co ﬃeld, Moseley, Hall, & Ecclestone, 2004 ; Miettinen, 2000). In particular, Miet- tinen ( 2000 )n o t e dt h a tD .A .K o l b ’s interpretation of the key works, upon which his model was assembled, fundamentally “gives a unilateral and erroneous picture ”(p. 65) of the original theories. Miettinen also argued that D. A. Kolb’ s work is eclectic. Consequently, the phases of the learning cycle “do not connect to each other in any organic or necessary way” (p. 61). In addition, some scholars (e.g. Seaman et al., 2017 ) proposed that Kolb ’s model in its current form actually presents as a barrier to a clearer understanding and successful facilitation of experiential learning. Alternative models have been proposed (e.g. Bergsteiner & Avery, 2014 ; Miettinen, 2000 ; Schenck & Cruickshank, 2015 ). However, these alternative models also lack sound empirical foundations. Kolb’s model remains the principle and most inﬂ uential model in experiential learning theory (Seaman et al., 2017 ). Nevertheless, the lack of empirical foundation to the model remains a foremost concern. A key issue in interpreting the Kolb model, that remains unresolved, is the issue of interpretation of what is meant, exactly, by a “concrete experience ”. In this regard, Bergsteiner et al. ( 2010 ) describe Kolb’s typology as “highly muddled ”(p. 32). For example, Blenkinsop, Nolan, Hunt, Stonehouse, and Telford ( 2016 ) note that many educators will not consider activities such as reading a book or sitting listening to a traditional
educators will not consider activities such as reading a book or sitting listening to a traditional lecture a concrete experience or part of experiential learning, whereas some educators would. This confusion seems somewhat ironic given that experience is, theoretically, the central and perhaps most salient feature of experiential learning theory. Further understanding in this regard may assist the successful facilitation of and contribute to scholarly work on the concept. To address this concern, the aim of the present study was toINTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 1065
understand how educators interpret the meaning of a “concrete experience ”. A systematic literature review of empirical studies on experiential education was conducted in a genuine attempt to examine, in experiential learning, Research Question 1: what constitutes a concrete experience? Research Question 2: what is the nature of treatment of a concrete experience? 3. Methodology An inductive thematic analysis was conducted upon data collected through a systematic and tar- geted literature review. 3.1. Data collection The systematic literature review was conducted on the premise that there is a tendency and nature of knowledge to develop and advance over time, especially in scholarly journals. A sample of 60 journal articles (summarized in Table 1 ) from a total of 1323 published journals in the targeted depository were analyzed in the present study. Data were drawn initially from the most recent up-to-date empiri- cal literature on experiential learning (starting with advance online publications). The investigator reviewed the sample in a stepwise nature. Journal articles were drawn from the Journal of Experiential Education, with the premise that the editors and peer-reviewers are experts intheﬁeld of experiential learning and publish articles that are ﬁtting with the concept. All articles were fully read by the investigator, who sought themes in the data. The investigator sys- tematically drew on further research published in each preceding year of publication until themes wereﬁnalized and further data did not appear to signi ﬁcantly further the ﬁndings and conclusions drawn. 3.2. Data analysis Data analysis software MAXQDA10 was used to code and organize the data. The 60 journal articleswere uploaded in PDF format into the software in order to begin the process of data coding and Table 1. Summary of journal articles included in the review.

identifying themes. The analysis followed six phases suggested by Braun and Clarke ( 2006 ) and exampled by Morris ( 2018 ), which involves the investigator (1) familiarizing themselves with the data (2) generating initial codes (3) searching for themes (4) reviewing themes (5) de ﬁning and naming themes, and (6) producing the report. Data familiarization was made where the investigator began to read the articles in full and noted down initial ideas regarding possible themes and codes within the data. The analysis was inductive in that codes and themes were not predetermined, but de ﬁned and rede ﬁned during the analysis. Using the data analysis software, parts of sentences, whole sentences, and groups of sentences were assigned one or more code(s). During the analysis new codes were de ﬁned and the initial analysis was revisited and data were recoded, where applicable. Themes were identi ﬁed and redeﬁ ned a number of times during the analysis. A thematic map was drawn ( Figure 1 ) to assist the organization of themes. After completion of the coding stage, the data software program was used to extract a Microsoft Excel data document with data extracts. At times, the data organization was complicated by the over-lapping of data into the themes identi ﬁed at this stage of the analysis and the researcher took a “best- ﬁt”approach to the classi ﬁcation of the data. The researcher made further notes about the data extracts, which assisted the process of ﬁnalizing the themes presented in this report (refer to Figure 1 ). Post hoc of data analysis, the themes were critically analyzed against the dimensions of D. A. Kolb ’s(1984 ) experiential learning model (cross-references shown in Figure 1 ). 4. Results The results give a rich overview of the conceptualization of experiential learning in accordance withthe studies analyzed. A notable observation when eyeballing Figure 1 (summary of themes in data) is that learner responsibility was the underpinning theme of the concept.

Five themes were identi ﬁed; three relating to research question 1, two relating to research question 2 and are discussed in detail in the forthcom- ing sections of this report, which is followed by a proposed revision to D. A. Kolb ’s(1984 ) learning cycle. 4.1. Research question 1: what constitutes a concrete experience? In experiential learning, learners are involved, active, engaged, participants in the learning process.Learner participation is central, where “learning by doing ”is a founding concept (Munge et al., 2018 ). It is a “hands on ”task-oriented process (Blair, 2016 ; Dorfsman & Horenczyk, 2018 ), which is based on direct experience (Blair, 2016 ; Seaman et al., 2017 ) that necessitates that learners are active in the process (F űz,2018 ; Munge et al., 2018 ).

Learners are placed physically, often in collaboration with others, in rich contextual learning environments that represent in the present moment, uncontrived, experience (Karo ﬀet al., 2017 ). Learners assume full or collaborative responsibility for the learning process (cf. Hou & Pereira, 2017 ). Physical contact seems important in the process (F űz,2018 ). Jordan et al. ( 2018 ) explain that students are engaged socially, intellectually, and physically, which supports the embodied nature of experiential learning. Coker et al. ( 2017 ) highlight that the process of experiential learning can demand a signi ﬁcant amount of time and e ﬀort. They refer to two dimensions, breadth and depth, which provide unique bene ﬁts: depth (time invested) is perhaps important for higher order thinking. Whereas, breadth (di ﬀerent types of experiences) is essential for fostering softer skills such as social competence. Knowledge is situated in context: emphasizing place and time. Experiential learning occurs in a speciﬁed place (Smith & Segbers, 2018 ), in which interactions and contact with people are key (Harper, 2018 ). Pipitone ( 2018 ) conceptualizes place, which has both geographical and conceptual aspects (cf. Harper, 2018 ), as “landscapes full of sociocultural and historical meanings to be engaged with” (p. 59). Engagement with the place is imperative in modulating participants to think more deeply and cri- tically about the societal norms and power structures that surround them (Deringer, 2017 ), providing a broader life experience (Ribbe Jr et al., 2016 ). Pipitone and Raghavan ( 2017 ) highlight the impor- tance of “social interactions, engagement with local rhythms and histories, and intentional narrative activities ”(p. 264) in grasping the nature of the experience. Moreover, Smith and Segbers ( 2018 ) explain that students learn from and learn how to live with people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, which can assist learners to appreciate
to live with people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, which can assist learners to appreciate transculturality.This“attends to the way in which humanity has moved about the globe with single cultures now intertwined ”(Smith & Segbers, 2018 , p. 77). Community engagement is central to the process (Deringer, 2017), where learners themselves are central to the context (cf. Burns & Danyluk, 2017 ). Blair (2016)i d e n t i ﬁes that the nature of knowledge construction is a social process (highlighting the works of Dewey, Piaget, andVygotsky). Furthermore, Fifolt et al. ( 2018 ) discuss the role of experiential learning in bringing a community together. This is particularly evident in service-learning (cf. Bennett et al., 2016 ). Pipitone ( 2018 ) discuss that to consider the learning space or place associated with the learning experience is to con-sider the socio-cultural and socio-spatial aspects of learning. Blair ( 2016 ) identi ﬁes that experience is also bound in time as well as place. In this regard, appreci- ation of the historical aspects of knowledge may necessitate a triangulation of learning means, whichcould include for example historical artifacts and videos of the historical occasion. Dorfsman and Hor- enczyk ( 2018 ) example that “educational museums are composed of objects, documents, and narra- tives that together create a learning experience ”(p. 1). Learning involves risk, as experiential learning incorporates novel, challenging, experiences. Lear- ners must respond to and accept challenge and behave with spontaneity to a new, novel, learning place or space that involves unpredictability and experimentation (Davidson et al., 2016 ;Fűz,2018 ; Karoﬀet al., 2017 ; Whittington et al., 2017 ). Isaak et al. ( 2018 ) point out that risk and uncertainty is inevitable in engagement with the real- world. Experiences are unique, thus learners are unlikely to experience a uniform experience twice(Asfeldt & Beames, 2017 ). In addition, experiential learning
experience a uniform experience twice(Asfeldt & Beames, 2017 ). In addition, experiential learning is more often than not a collaborative process. Gibbons et al. (2018) provide examples of collaborative challe nges: balancing a group on a small object or group negotiation of a challenging obstacle course. Karo ﬀet al. ( 2017)d i s c u s st h a tf o rs u c h novel experiences learners do not have a “script ”, which promotes task di ﬃculty. In this regard, support and trust from co-actors in the learning process seem essential (cf. Dorfsman & Horenczyk, 2018).1068 T. H. MORRIS
Moreover, the educator inevitably plays a very important role in facilitating the process, such as assisting learners to remain open to trying novel solutions to problems, encouraging tenacious atti- tudes, and promoting the e ﬀectiveness of communication skills (Isaak et al., 2018 ). Additionally, the process is often progressive in di ﬃculty. Educators gradually increase the diﬃculty of the intellectual, social, emotional, and/or physical challenge (Gibbons et al., 2018 ). 4.2. Research question 2: what is the nature of treatment of a concrete experience? Critical re ﬂection is imperative in the process, which may act as a mediator of meaning-making. The complex nature of problem-solving involved with experiential learning demands higher order think-ing (Collins et al., 2016 ). It is not surprising, therefore, that experiential learning fosters critical thinking skills (cf. James & Williams, 2017 ; Scogin et al., 2017 ). Reﬂection and analysis, which is often undertaken both alone (e.g. quiet time for journaling; Harper, 2018 ) and in collaboration with others, are two central features of the experiential learning process (Fede et al., 2018 ; Isaak et al., 2018 ). In reference to the works of Dewey (1938/ 1963 ), Asfeldt et al. ( 2018 ) discuss that re ﬂection plays a central role in the learning process and is vital for making meaning of experience (cf. Deringer, 2017 ). In this regard, scholars generally position with a constructivist stance toward meaning-making (e.g. Dorfsman & Horenczyk, 2018 ; Grimwood et al., 2018 ; Isaak et al., 2018 ). Dialogue in collaboration with others, such as with the instructor and peers, allows further (double loop) deeper critical re ﬂection (Asfeldt et al., 2018 ; Collins et al., 2016 ). This often demands that lear- ners critically re ﬂect upon their previously uncritically assimilated abstract conceptualizations, where learner self-awareness is brought about and new or revised understanding is construed (cf. Hou & Pereira,
self-awareness is brought about and new or revised understanding is construed (cf. Hou & Pereira, 2017 ). Consequently, experiential learning is often an emotionally intense experience, as metacognitive awareness of “self”is gained. Larsen ( 2017 ) concludes that experiential learning is a “highly charged, emotional experience ”(p. 279). Learning is purposeful and demands learners to take responsibility to act pragmatically to ﬁnd sol- utions, through an inquiry process, to speci ﬁc real-world problems. Learners have clear and purpose- ful roles and responsibilities in the learning process (Bialka & Havlik, 2016 ; Fifolt et al., 2018 ). Learning is problem-based, often project-based (Scogin et al., 2017 ). Thus, utilizes inquiry-driven learning methodologies (Munge et al., 2018 ). Terms associated with experiential learning include inquiry-based learning, student-directed learning, active learning, problem-based learning, service- learning, and project-based learning (Blair, 2016 ; Breunig, 2017 ). Furthermore, Fede et al. ( 2018 ) point out that a key feature is that students are responsible for decision making throughout the process. This demands initiative and stimulates learner intellectualand emotional engagement. Thus, there is an emphasis on learner choice , which Isaak et al. ( 2018 ) identify as the sine qua non of experiential learning. In sum, learners are o ﬀered  autonomy and are empowered to make decisions (Barron et al., 2017 ; Dorfsman & Horenczyk, 2018 ). Learners may negotiate solutions through creative means, the outcome of which cannot be pre- dicted at the start of the learning process. Learners often complete problem-solving activities in smallteams. Gibbons et al. ( 2018 ) example that “Typically, participants work in groups of six to eight on physically challenging tasks that require elements of communication, cooperation, trust, and risk ” (p. 3). Isaak et al. ( 2018 ) discuss a “sense of connection ”(p. 34) as learners work
and risk ” (p. 3). Isaak et al. ( 2018 ) discuss a “sense of connection ”(p. 34) as learners work collaboratively. Learner communication is essential for the success of the process (Gibbons et al., 2018 ), as students learn with and from each other (Murphy et al., 2017 ), pondering solutions through dialogue (Glowacki- Dudka et al., 2017 ). Consequently, relationships tend to develop through the process (Fifolt et al., 2018 ). The process of ﬁnding solutions to problems may inherently stipulate creative ideas and creative solutions. Thus, demanding learners to think creatively (Collins et al., 2016 ; Isaak et al., 2018 ; Jordan et al.,2018 ; Scogin et al., 2017 ).INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 1069
In particular, Collins et al. ( 2016 ) point out that the process involves the solving of ill-structured problems, which is positioned as a critical competence in contemporary complex societies. They identify three important aspects: creativity, tolerance for novelty, and cognitive ﬂexibility, in which adaptability is a central feature, which enables the bridging between theory and practice (Barnes, 2016 ). 4.3. Revision to Kolb ’s model The aim of the present study was to understand how educators interpret the meaning of a “concrete experience ”. In the studies examined, concrete experience represented highly contextualized, primary, experience that involves hands-on learner experience in uncontrived real-world situations. This is contrary to D. A. Kolb ’s(1984 ,2015 ) own conceptualization that experiential learning refers to“the individual learning process that applied in all situations and arenas of life, a holistic process of learning ”(2015 , p. xx). This ﬁnding represents a clear and important di ﬀerence in the conceptualiz- ation of what constitutes a concrete experience and seemingly warrants a revision to Kolb ’s learning cycle ( Figure 2 ). The present paper did provide support for four dimensions of experiential learning, as per D. A. Kolb’s model ( 1984 ). The ﬁve themes identi ﬁed in the analysis coupled closely with Kolb’ s four dimensions (refer to ﬁgure 1 ), with however some very subtle but signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences, which are summarized in Figure 2 . These seemingly very important di ﬀerences are explained further in the following sections. As noted in the methodology section of the present report, the data organization was complicated by the overlapping of the data into the themes identi ﬁed. In this regard, themes, which are rep- resented in the proposed model ( Figure 2 ), were clearly very organically adjoined, which addresses Miettinen ’s(2000 ) concern of Kolb ’s model that its dimensions do not couple in a very organic or necessary way.
) concern of Kolb ’s model that its dimensions do not couple in a very organic or necessary way. Moreover, the proposed model takes into account graphical syntax issues highlighted by Bergstei- ner et al. ( 2010 ) that (1) in accepted modeling practice time-lines should represent activities, and (2) simpli ﬁcation of the model can be achieved by removing the horizontal and vertical bidirectional arrows on Kolb ’s model, which merely highlights orthogonal bipolar relationships between active experimentation and re ﬂective observation, and concrete experience and abstract conceptualization (Figure 2 ). The proposed changes to the Kolb model are detailed in the following sections. 4.3.1. Concrete experience In the studies examined in the present report, learners were involved, active, engaged, participants in the learning process. Learners were placed physically, often in collaboration with others, in Contextually rich concrete  experience Critical  reflective  observation  Contextual-specific abstract  conceptualizationPragmatic active  experimentation Figure 2. Experiential learning cycle (a revision to D. A. Kolb ’s1984 model).1070 T. H. MORRIS
contextually rich learning environments that represented in the present moment, uncontrived, “hands on ”, real-world primary concrete experiences (e.g. Grimwood et al., 2018 ; Larsen, 2017 ; Schary & Waldron, 2017 ). The idea of a “contextually rich ”concrete experience (refer to Figure 2 ) actually falls against Kolb ’s own conceptualization of experiential learning theory, who rather viewed concrete experiences as experiences that occur in “all situations and arenas of life ”(D. A. Kolb, 2015 , p. xx) that come through the sensory cortex (A. Y. Kolb & Kolb, 2013 ). An important distinction between the model proposed in the present paper and the Kolb model, concerning the interpretation of what is considered a concrete experience in experiential learning theory, is highlighted in one theme in the data of the present report: that knowledge is situated in context: emphasizing place (including community, cultural, societal, and/or social aspects) andtime (present and/or historical). A key aspect of the learning process concerns learners learning to appreciate that knowledge is situated in context: ﬂuid across time and place. Again, the need for learning to be situated in context was not stipulated in D. A. Kolb ’s conceptualization of experiential learning ( 1984 ,2015 ). However, the present research report found that, rather, experiential learning is conceptualized by educators and scholars as a process in which learners are immersed in learning experiences thatcontain the fullest contextual information possible, in which the experiential learning process takes place. In this regard, Jarvis ( 2012 ), in particular, voiced a clear critique of D. A. Kolb ’s model: that it does not take into consideration the social context of learning. Again, the studies examined in the presentpaper highlighted that the social context of learning has a central place in experiential learning theory. For example, in examining experiential learning from a socio-spatial perspective,
learning theory. For example, in examining experiential learning from a socio-spatial perspective, Pipitone and Raghavan ( 2017 ) identi ﬁed meaning-making as both a “participatory and collaborative process mediated through the body and embedded within social, spatial, and temporal realities ”(p. 265) and it is through our body ’s senses that we are able to experience place. Embodiment is a central consequence of immersing learners physically in the learning space. This is a key area for further research, which is discussed in more detail in the conclusions of the presentreport. 4.3.2. Re ﬂective observation D. A. Kolb ( 1984 ,2015 ) did not stress the need for “critical ”reﬂection in his conceptualization of experiential learning: he did not di ﬀerentiate between the requirement for critical or non-critical reﬂection during the learning process. However, it became clear in the present study that the solving of problems in context stipulates the need for critical re ﬂection. Indeed, some authors (e.g. Harper, 2018 ) acknowledged that their course of experiential learning was informed by critical theory (Brook ﬁeld,2001 ; Mezirow, 1981 ). In this regard, the studies analyzed in the present report highlighted that critical reﬂective obser- vation is essential in the process ( Figure 2 ), which acts as a mediator of meaning-making. In the process, learners must act in an investigator-like manner and test the ﬁttingness of new or pre-exist- ing abstract conceptualizations against the present moment real-world experience (cf. Barron et al., 2017 ). That is, in order to e ﬀectively solve problems situated in a context that are posed during the learn- ing process, considering the details of the conditions of the context seems imperative because pro-blems are inherently context speci ﬁc (cf. Langer, 2017 ). In the studies examined in the present paper, problems were authentic, but also generally open-ended (Scogin et al., 2017 ), with a purposeful aim (Breunig, 2017 ),
but also generally open-ended (Scogin et al., 2017 ), with a purposeful aim (Breunig, 2017 ), where there was a need for learners to be comfortable with ambiguity and uncer- tainty (Ricke, 2018 ). This may be understood further in terms of the Socratic concept that learners may approach the learning situation with a stance that all knowledge is provisional: learners may appreciate that theyINTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 1071
do not yet “know”and that solutions to problems in a real-world context are context speci ﬁc (cf. Scott, 2018 ). Through experiential learning, learners may begin to appreciate the ﬂuidity of contex- tual-conditions across place and time and become comfortable with change and uncertainty (cf. Langer, 2017 ). Indeed, in remodeling Dewey ’s theory on experience and re ﬂective thought and action, Miettinin (2000 ) interprets Dewey ’s ideas in a di ﬀerent way to D. A. Kolb: depicting a process of learning that includes deﬁ ning the problem and studying the conditions of the problem situation in order to for- mulate a working hypothesis. The model presented by Miettinin ( 2000 ) is seemingly complementary to the model proposed in the present paper and may, in addition, assist readers to understand themeaning of experiential learning. 4.3.3. Abstract conceptualization Resultant from critical re ﬂection on contextually rich concrete experience, the present model pro- poses that abstract conceptualizations may construe critically, that is, contextual-speci ﬁc(Figure 2 ). Again, D. A. Kolb ( 1984 ,2015 ) did not make the distinction between the formation of uncritically or critically assimilated abstract conceptualizations. Conversely, the proposed model predicts that in order for the model to operate as a spiral, with increasing complexity as a human develops andmatures, contextual-speci ﬁcabstract conceptualizations are mandatory. A key aspect of this concerns learners learning to appreciate that the conditions of the context may change across time and place and therefore all knowledge is provisional and needs testing incontext. This could be conceptualized as a “working hypothesis ”(as per Dewey ’s ideas, described in Miettinin, 2000 ), which when passed through active experimentation in new concrete experiences they become, potentially, higher order concepts. The importance of appreciating that abstract conceptualizations construe as contextual-speci ﬁci n experiential
of appreciating that abstract conceptualizations construe as contextual-speci ﬁci n experiential learning theory (critically assimilated), rather than contextual-indi ﬀerent (uncritically assimilated), is found in critical theory. Mezirow ’s(1978 ,1981 ,1991 ) work highlights that when abstract conceptualizations are uncritically assimilated, we get “caught in our own history and are reliving it ”(1978 , p. 101; readers are encouraged to read further in this regard: Mezirow, 1991 ). This form of learning may actually limit a person ’s growth potential toward becoming the person they could be (cf. Arnold, 2017 ). In this regard, it is possible to plot a very di ﬀerent alternative learning cycle which involves (1) con- textually-poor experience (2) uncritical re ﬂective observation (3) contextual-indi ﬀerent abstract con- ceptualization, and (4) reinforcing/repeating active experimentation. Rather than a spiral, this cycle would represent a circle, where actions are repeated and would, rather, complement behaviorist epis- temology (cf. Murtonen et al., 2017 ). Indeed, it seems important to point out that experiential learning theory does not capture all forms of human learning; and probably no learning model will ever do so (Merriam, Ca ﬀarella, & Baumgartner, 2007 ). 4.3.4. Active experimentation A key potential bene ﬁto fcontextual-speci ﬁcabstract conceptualizations is that they may enable lear- ners to act pragmatically –to base their actions on their concrete experiences –in active experimen- tation with an encounter with a new concrete experience. In other words, this involves testing the ﬁttingness of abstract conceptualizations formulated against new concrete experiences. Indeed, Roberts ( 2018 ) explains that a central tenet of experiential learning is found in the etymol- ogy of the word “experience ”, which means “to test ”,o r“to risk ”in Latin. In this regard, the process integrally involves risk, as experiential learning incorporates novel, challenging,
the process integrally involves risk, as experiential learning incorporates novel, challenging, experiences. Learnersmust respond to, accept the challenge of, and behave with spontaneity to the unpredictability that is inherent in the process. It should be considered that experiential learning is a process that deliberately places learners out of their comfort zones and, consequently, learners may learn to appreciate that conditions change,1072 T. H. MORRIS
sometimes very discretely, across time and place. Bailey et al. ( 2017 ) discuss that novelty and chal- lenge, inherent in experiential learning, facilitates the process of inducing cognitive dissonance, as learners are challenged and “destabilized ”(cf. Glazier et al., 2017 ; McGowan, 2016 ). It was clear in the analysis of the present paper that experiential learning is a process in which the concrete experiences “push the edges of what they [the learners] are familiar with ”(Grimwood et al., 2018 , p. 9). Wainwright et al. ( 2017 ) discuss that immersion in a new place or space is one aspect that induces unfamiliarity. D. A. Kolb ( 1984 ) did acknowledge that active experimentation involves utilizing “theories to make decisions and solve problems ”(p. 30). However, the model proposed in the present paper ( Figure 2 ) makes the distinction, which was not made by D. A. Kolb ( 1984 ,2015 ), that because, in the real-world, problems are inherently contextual-speci ﬁc and ill-structured learners must become accustomed to considering the conditions in which problems are situated; in order to facilitate learners to progress successfully, in a spiral of learning, toward maturation and growth. 5. Conclusions and future works The present study provides a rich insight into how educators may conceptualize and facilitate the concept of experiential learning (refer to Figure 1 for a summary of themes). The ﬁndings warranted subtle but key adjustments to D. A. Kolb’s( 1984 ,2015 ) learning cycle ( Figure 2 ), which are proposed as important considerations in further works on experiential learning theory. The revision to Kolb ’s model proposed addresses many key critiques that: there is a shortage of a sound empirical foundation to the model (e.g. Co ﬃeld et al., 2004 ; Miettinen, 2000 ), the dimensions of the model do not connect to each other cohesively (e.g. Jarvis, 2012 ; Miettinen, 2000 ), and the model typology lacks clarity (Bergsteiner et al., 2010 ). There were some
2000 ), and the model typology lacks clarity (Bergsteiner et al., 2010 ). There were some weaknesses of the present study. In particular, although the systematic nature of the study allowed a rich insight into how educators conceptualize and facilitate experiential learningin practice, most studies reviewed were limited to contexts that represented out-of-classroom experience. There may be multiple reasons for this, including that physically getting out of the classroom may assist to facilitate experiential learning. In this case, examining the factors that encourage or discou-rage out-of-classroom experience seems essential. Moreover, publication bias toward what is seen as experiential learning cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, many of the studies analyzed were conducted in North America. This is an important consideration because it is possible that there are di ﬀerential conceptualizations of experiential learn- ing in di ﬀerent contexts. Moreover, studying the factors that limit the facilitation of experiential learn- ing was not an aim of the present study but is an important area for future research. Empirical testing of the proposed model is required, with potentially further revisions. Further studies may focus to address other critiques, which was not possible in the present research;especially concerns of further modeling issues, including whether the arrows should be bidirectional rather than unidirectional and whether concrete experience should be assigned as the starting point (cf. Jarvis, 2012 ). Furthermore, the complexity of the experiential learning process (as depicted in Figure 1 ) should not be taken for granted. In this regard, further research could consider the facilitation of experientiallearning from an educator ’s perspective, including how to train educator competence to facilitate experiential learning. Moreover, another key area for further research concerns how over time one ’s learning spiral may become more complex, as a human
further research concerns how over time one ’s learning spiral may become more complex, as a human develops and matures. In this regard, some scholars in the ﬁeld of experiential learning have realized the need to appreciate complementary knowledge in the ﬁeld of cognitive sciences (e.g. Schenck & Cruickshank, 2015 ). Speciﬁcally, as identi ﬁed in the present paper, embodiment that accompanies the experiential learning process represents a very important focus for further studies. Embodiment is a relativelyINTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 1073
underdeveloped area of research in educational and cognitive sciences (refer to Dijkerman & Leng- genhager, 2018 ; Kiefer & Trumpp, 2012 , for reviews). Further studies should appreciate the recent ﬁndings from cognitive sciences that suggests that embodiment is an essential part of fostering a learner ’s deep conceptual understanding. In particular, in a review article Kiefer and Trumpp ( 2012 ) discuss that over the last decades scholars wrongly assumed that when perceptual and motor systems coded knowledge in abstract-symbolic format, modality-speci ﬁc sensory-motor information was lost. Rather, there is surmounting evidence that cognition is, vitally, based on reinstatements of sensing (using the relevant sensory organs), and/or feeling/acting (using the motor/proprioceptive organs) that accompanied the original experience. Thus, when learners are immersed, with their body , in a contextually rich experience, sensory- motor information becomes embodied in memory traces. It is thought that embodiment is essential for deep conceptual understanding and “for human cognition to develop at the highest level ”(Kiefer & Trumpp, 2012 , p. 19). In other words, potentially, to secure deep and meaningful learning the body cannot be decoupled from the mind during the process of learning. Indeed, in some educational contexts, such as in the vocational education and training of adults in the Netherlands, there has been a shift away from domain-speci ﬁc knowledge taught in classrooms (mind work, no body work) exactly because it has been realized that such education does not fosterlearners ’deep conceptual understanding of workplace knowledge and skills (cf. Biemans et al., 2004 ; Descy & Tessaring, 2002 ; Jossberger et al., 2010 ,2018 ). In this regard, experiential learning is a particular form of learning that, in addition to the many other possible learner bene ﬁts gained from the process detailed in the present paper, has much potential to foster learners ’deep conceptual
the process detailed in the present paper, has much potential to foster learners ’deep conceptual understanding. Experiential learning is potentially appli- cable, but to date perhaps hugely unrealized, in a wide variety of educational contexts.

Experiential learning –a systematic review and revision of Kolb ’s model Thomas Howard Morris Department of Adult and Vocational Education, Technische Universität Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany ABSTRACT Kolb’s experiential learning cycle is perhaps the most scholarly in ﬂuential and cited model regarding experiential learning theory. However, a key issue in interpreting Kolb ’s model concerns a lack of clarity regarding what constitutes a concrete experience , exactly. A systematic literature review was conducted in order to examine: what constitutes a concreteexperience and what is the nature of treatment of a concrete experience in experiential learning? The analysis revealed ﬁve themes: learners are involved, active, participants; knowledge is situated in place and time;learners are exposed to novel experiences, which involves risk; learningdemands inquiry to speci ﬁc real-world problems; and critical re ﬂection acts as a mediator of meaningful learning. Accordingly, a revision toKolb’s model is proposed: experiential learning consists of contextually richconcrete experience, critical reﬂective observation, contextual-speci ﬁc abstract conceptualization, and pragmatic active experimentation. Further empirical studies are required to test the model proposed.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 29 May 2018 Accepted 20 November 2018 KEYWORDS Experiential learning theory; experiential learning cycle; concrete experience; criticaltheory; systematic literaturereview; teaching and education 1. Introduction What is fascinating about learning is that it cannot occur without experience . Imagine trying to learn to tie shoelaces without having the practical experience of having hands-on laces. On the other hand, try to forget your knowledge of how to ride a bike. Perhaps most notably, John Dewey (1938/ 1963 ) proposed that although not all experiences are equally educative, “all genuine education comes about through experience ”(p. 25). Experiential learning theory takes a
genuine education comes about through experience ”(p. 25). Experiential learning theory takes a fundamentally di ﬀerent view of the learning process in com- parison to behavioral learning theory. It places life experience as a central and necessary part of the learning process, where “knowledge is created through the transformation of experience ”(D. A. Kolb, 2015 , p. 49; emphasis in original). However, relatively little empirical research has been conducted on experiential learning (Bergsteiner, Avery, & Neumann, 2010 ; Jarvis, 2012 ). Nonetheless, according to D. A. Kolb ( 2015 ), over the past 20 years research on experiential learn- ing has more than quadrupled in many ﬁelds such as management, education, information science, psychology, medicine, nursing, accounting, and law. This includes a renewed interest in and attentionto employing experiential learning in formal educational settings, especially in Higher Education. Thus, furthering our understanding of the concept of experiential learning and how to facilitate it is an important area for research, especially given the limitations of experiential learning theory high-lighted in the following section. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis GroupCONTACT Thomas Howard Morris thomas.morris@sowi.uni-kl.deINTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 2020, VOL. 28, NO. 8, 1064 –1077 https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2019.1570279
2. Kolb ’s experiential learning cycle D. A. Kolb ’s(1984 ) experiential learning cycle remains the most widely inﬂ uential and cited model, or “clearest expression ”, of experiential learning theory (Seaman, Brown, & Quay, 2017 , p. 3). Kolb ( 1984 ) theorized that, Learners, if they are to be e ﬀective, need four di ﬀerent kinds of abilities —concrete experience abilities (CE), reﬂec- tive observation abilities (RO), abstract conceptualization abilities (AC), and active experimentation (AE) abilities. That is, they must be able to involve themselves fully, openly, and without bias in new experiences (CE). They must be able to reﬂ ect on and observe their experiences from many perspectives (RO). They must be able to create concepts that integrate their observations into logically sound theories (AC), and they must be able touse these theories to make decisions and solve problems (AE). (p. 30; emphasis in original) More than thirty years onwards, D. A. Kolb ( 2015 ) defended his theoretical position against a multi- tude of critiques (e.g. Bergsteiner et al., 2010 ; Bergsteiner & Avery, 2014 ; Jarvis, 2012 ; Miettinen, 2000 ; Schenck & Cruickshank, 2015 ) that the experiential learning process consists of, a four-stage cycle involving four adaptive learning modes (p. 66) …[where] Learning arises from the resol- ution of creative tension among these four learning modes. This process is portrayed as an idealized learn-ing cycle or spiral where the learner “touches all the bases ”–experiencing (CE), re ﬂecting (RO), thinking (AC), and acting (AE) –in a recursive process that is sensitive to the learning situation and what is being learned. (p. 51) Kolb acknowledged that he discovered or “noticed the dimensions ”(D. A. Kolb, 2015 , p. 56) of the theory in the works of prominent twentieth-century scholars Kurt Lewin, John Dewey, and Jean Piaget and attempted to “integrate the common themes in their work into a systematic framework that can address twenty- ﬁrst century
the common themes in their work into a systematic framework that can address twenty- ﬁrst century problems of learning and education ”(p. xvii). Intertwined with experiential learning theory is the concept of learning styles (outside the scope of the present paper;refer to A. Y. Kolb & Kolb, 2013 , for review; Schenck & Cruickshank, 2015 , for critique). A damming critique of experiential learning theory is that it lacks sound theoretical and empiri- cal foundations (cf. Co ﬃeld, Moseley, Hall, & Ecclestone, 2004 ; Miettinen, 2000). In particular, Miet- tinen ( 2000 )n o t e dt h a tD .A .K o l b ’s interpretation of the key works, upon which his model was assembled, fundamentally “gives a unilateral and erroneous picture ”(p. 65) of the original theories. Miettinen also argued that D. A. Kolb’ s work is eclectic. Consequently, the phases of the learning cycle “do not connect to each other in any organic or necessary way” (p. 61). In addition, some scholars (e.g. Seaman et al., 2017 ) proposed that Kolb ’s model in its current form actually presents as a barrier to a clearer understanding and successful facilitation of experiential learning. Alternative models have been proposed (e.g. Bergsteiner & Avery, 2014 ; Miettinen, 2000 ; Schenck & Cruickshank, 2015 ). However, these alternative models also lack sound empirical foundations. Kolb’s model remains the principle and most inﬂ uential model in experiential learning theory (Seaman et al., 2017 ). Nevertheless, the lack of empirical foundation to the model remains a foremost concern. A key issue in interpreting the Kolb model, that remains unresolved, is the issue of interpretation of what is meant, exactly, by a “concrete experience ”. In this regard, Bergsteiner et al. ( 2010 ) describe Kolb’s typology as “highly muddled ”(p. 32). For example, Blenkinsop, Nolan, Hunt, Stonehouse, and Telford ( 2016 ) note that many educators will not consider activities such as reading a book or sitting listening to a traditional
educators will not consider activities such as reading a book or sitting listening to a traditional lecture a concrete experience or part of experiential learning, whereas some educators would. This confusion seems somewhat ironic given that experience is, theoretically, the central and perhaps most salient feature of experiential learning theory. Further understanding in this regard may assist the successful facilitation of and contribute to scholarly work on the concept. To address this concern, the aim of the present study was toINTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 1065
understand how educators interpret the meaning of a “concrete experience ”. A systematic literature review of empirical studies on experiential education was conducted in a genuine attempt to examine, in experiential learning, Research Question 1: what constitutes a concrete experience? Research Question 2: what is the nature of treatment of a concrete experience? 3. Methodology An inductive thematic analysis was conducted upon data collected through a systematic and tar- geted literature review. 3.1. Data collection The systematic literature review was conducted on the premise that there is a tendency and nature of knowledge to develop and advance over time, especially in scholarly journals. A sample of 60 journal articles (summarized in Table 1 ) from a total of 1323 published journals in the targeted depository were analyzed in the present study. Data were drawn initially from the most recent up-to-date empiri- cal literature on experiential learning (starting with advance online publications). The investigator reviewed the sample in a stepwise nature. Journal articles were drawn from the Journal of Experiential Education, with the premise that the editors and peer-reviewers are experts intheﬁeld of experiential learning and publish articles that are ﬁtting with the concept. All articles were fully read by the investigator, who sought themes in the data. The investigator sys- tematically drew on further research published in each preceding year of publication until themes wereﬁnalized and further data did not appear to signi ﬁcantly further the ﬁndings and conclusions drawn. 3.2. Data analysis Data analysis software MAXQDA10 was used to code and organize the data. The 60 journal articleswere uploaded in PDF format into the software in order to begin the process of data coding and Table 1. Summary of journal articles included in the review.

identifying themes. The analysis followed six phases suggested by Braun and Clarke ( 2006 ) and exampled by Morris ( 2018 ), which involves the investigator (1) familiarizing themselves with the data (2) generating initial codes (3) searching for themes (4) reviewing themes (5) de ﬁning and naming themes, and (6) producing the report. Data familiarization was made where the investigator began to read the articles in full and noted down initial ideas regarding possible themes and codes within the data. The analysis was inductive in that codes and themes were not predetermined, but de ﬁned and rede ﬁned during the analysis. Using the data analysis software, parts of sentences, whole sentences, and groups of sentences were assigned one or more code(s). During the analysis new codes were de ﬁned and the initial analysis was revisited and data were recoded, where applicable. Themes were identi ﬁed and redeﬁ ned a number of times during the analysis. A thematic map was drawn ( Figure 1 ) to assist the organization of themes. After completion of the coding stage, the data software program was used to extract a Microsoft Excel data document with data extracts. At times, the data organization was complicated by the over-lapping of data into the themes identi ﬁed at this stage of the analysis and the researcher took a “best- ﬁt”approach to the classi ﬁcation of the data. The researcher made further notes about the data extracts, which assisted the process of ﬁnalizing the themes presented in this report (refer to Figure 1 ). Post hoc of data analysis, the themes were critically analyzed against the dimensions of D. A. Kolb ’s(1984 ) experiential learning model (cross-references shown in Figure 1 ). 4. Results The results give a rich overview of the conceptualization of experiential learning in accordance withthe studies analyzed.

A. Kolb ’s(1984 ) learning cycle. 4.1. Research question 1: what constitutes a concrete experience? In experiential learning, learners are involved, active, engaged, participants in the learning process.Learner participation is central, where “learning by doing ”is a founding concept (Munge et al., 2018 ). It is a “hands on ”task-oriented process (Blair, 2016 ; Dorfsman & Horenczyk, 2018 ), which is based on direct experience (Blair, 2016 ; Seaman et al., 2017 ) that necessitates that learners are active in the process (F űz,2018 ; Munge et al., 2018 ).

Learners are placed physically, often in collaboration with others, in rich contextual learning environments that represent in the present moment, uncontrived, experience (Karo ﬀet al., 2017 ). Learners assume full or collaborative responsibility for the learning process (cf. Hou & Pereira, 2017 ). Physical contact seems important in the process (F űz,2018 ). Jordan et al. ( 2018 ) explain that students are engaged socially, intellectually, and physically, which supports the embodied nature of experiential learning. Coker et al. ( 2017 ) highlight that the process of experiential learning can demand a signi ﬁcant amount of time and e ﬀort. They refer to two dimensions, breadth and depth, which provide unique bene ﬁts: depth (time invested) is perhaps important for higher order thinking. Whereas, breadth (di ﬀerent types of experiences) is essential for fostering softer skills such as social competence. Knowledge is situated in context: emphasizing place and time. Experiential learning occurs in a speciﬁed place (Smith & Segbers, 2018 ), in which interactions and contact with people are key (Harper, 2018 ). Pipitone ( 2018 ) conceptualizes place, which has both geographical and conceptual aspects (cf. Harper, 2018 ), as “landscapes full of sociocultural and historical meanings to be engaged with” (p. 59). Engagement with the place is imperative in modulating participants to think more deeply and cri- tically about the societal norms and power structures that surround them (Deringer, 2017 ), providing a broader life experience (Ribbe Jr et al., 2016 ). Pipitone and Raghavan ( 2017 ) highlight the impor- tance of “social interactions, engagement with local rhythms and histories, and intentional narrative activities ”(p. 264) in grasping the nature of the experience. Moreover, Smith and Segbers ( 2018 ) explain that students learn from and learn how to live with people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, which can assist learners to appreciate
to live with people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, which can assist learners to appreciate transculturality.This“attends to the way in which humanity has moved about the globe with single cultures now intertwined ”(Smith & Segbers, 2018 , p. 77). Community engagement is central to the process (Deringer, 2017), where learners themselves are central to the context (cf. Burns & Danyluk, 2017 ). Blair (2016)i d e n t i ﬁes that the nature of knowledge construction is a social process (highlighting the works of Dewey, Piaget, andVygotsky). Furthermore, Fifolt et al. ( 2018 ) discuss the role of experiential learning in bringing a community together. This is particularly evident in service-learning (cf. Bennett et al., 2016 ). Pipitone ( 2018 ) discuss that to consider the learning space or place associated with the learning experience is to con-sider the socio-cultural and socio-spatial aspects of learning. Blair ( 2016 ) identi ﬁes that experience is also bound in time as well as place. In this regard, appreci- ation of the historical aspects of knowledge may necessitate a triangulation of learning means, whichcould include for example historical artifacts and videos of the historical occasion. Dorfsman and Hor- enczyk ( 2018 ) example that “educational museums are composed of objects, documents, and narra- tives that together create a learning experience ”(p. 1). Learning involves risk, as experiential learning incorporates novel, challenging, experiences. Lear- ners must respond to and accept challenge and behave with spontaneity to a new, novel, learning place or space that involves unpredictability and experimentation (Davidson et al., 2016 ;Fűz,2018 ; Karoﬀet al., 2017 ; Whittington et al., 2017 ). Isaak et al. ( 2018 ) point out that risk and uncertainty is inevitable in engagement with the real- world. Experiences are unique, thus learners are unlikely to experience a uniform experience twice(Asfeldt & Beames, 2017 ). In addition, experiential learning
experience a uniform experience twice(Asfeldt & Beames, 2017 ). In addition, experiential learning is more often than not a collaborative process. Gibbons et al. (2018) provide examples of collaborative challe nges: balancing a group on a small object or group negotiation of a challenging obstacle course. Karo ﬀet al. ( 2017)d i s c u s st h a tf o rs u c h novel experiences learners do not have a “script ”, which promotes task di ﬃculty. In this regard, support and trust from co-actors in the learning process seem essential (cf. Dorfsman & Horenczyk, 2018).1068 T. H. MORRIS
Moreover, the educator inevitably plays a very important role in facilitating the process, such as assisting learners to remain open to trying novel solutions to problems, encouraging tenacious atti- tudes, and promoting the e ﬀectiveness of communication skills (Isaak et al., 2018 ). Additionally, the process is often progressive in di ﬃculty. Educators gradually increase the diﬃculty of the intellectual, social, emotional, and/or physical challenge (Gibbons et al., 2018 ). 4.2. Research question 2: what is the nature of treatment of a concrete experience? Critical re ﬂection is imperative in the process, which may act as a mediator of meaning-making. The complex nature of problem-solving involved with experiential learning demands higher order think-ing (Collins et al., 2016 ). It is not surprising, therefore, that experiential learning fosters critical thinking skills (cf. James & Williams, 2017 ; Scogin et al., 2017 ). Reﬂection and analysis, which is often undertaken both alone (e.g. quiet time for journaling; Harper, 2018 ) and in collaboration with others, are two central features of the experiential learning process (Fede et al., 2018 ; Isaak et al., 2018 ). In reference to the works of Dewey (1938/ 1963 ), Asfeldt et al. ( 2018 ) discuss that re ﬂection plays a central role in the learning process and is vital for making meaning of experience (cf. Deringer, 2017 ). In this regard, scholars generally position with a constructivist stance toward meaning-making (e.g. Dorfsman & Horenczyk, 2018 ; Grimwood et al., 2018 ; Isaak et al., 2018 ). Dialogue in collaboration with others, such as with the instructor and peers, allows further (double loop) deeper critical re ﬂection (Asfeldt et al., 2018 ; Collins et al., 2016 ). This often demands that lear- ners critically re ﬂect upon their previously uncritically assimilated abstract conceptualizations, where learner self-awareness is brought about and new or revised understanding is construed (cf. Hou & Pereira, --- and risk ” (p. 3). Isaak et al. ( 2018 ) discuss a “sense of connection ”(p. 34) as learners work collaboratively. Learner communication is essential for the success of the process (Gibbons et al., 2018 ), as students learn with and from each other (Murphy et al., 2017 ), pondering solutions through dialogue (Glowacki- Dudka et al., 2017 ). Consequently, relationships tend to develop through the process (Fifolt et al., 2018 ). The process of ﬁnding solutions to problems may inherently stipulate creative ideas and creative solutions. Thus, demanding learners to think creatively (Collins et al., 2016 ; Isaak et al., 2018 ; Jordan et al.,2018 ; Scogin et al., 2017 ).INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 1069
self-awareness is brought about and new or revised understanding is construed (cf. Hou & Pereira, 2017 ). Consequently, experiential learning is often an emotionally intense experience, as metacognitive awareness of “self”is gained. Larsen ( 2017 ) concludes that experiential learning is a “highly charged, emotional experience ”(p. 279). Learning is purposeful and demands learners to take responsibility to act pragmatically to ﬁnd sol- utions, through an inquiry process, to speci ﬁc real-world problems. Learners have clear and purpose- ful roles and responsibilities in the learning process (Bialka & Havlik, 2016 ; Fifolt et al., 2018 ). Learning is problem-based, often project-based (Scogin et al., 2017 ). Thus, utilizes inquiry-driven learning methodologies (Munge et al., 2018 ). Terms associated with experiential learning include inquiry-based learning, student-directed learning, active learning, problem-based learning, service- learning, and project-based learning (Blair, 2016 ; Breunig, 2017 ). Furthermore, Fede et al. ( 2018 ) point out that a key feature is that students are responsible for decision making throughout the process. This demands initiative and stimulates learner intellectualand emotional engagement. Thus, there is an emphasis on learner choice , which Isaak et al. ( 2018 ) identify as the sine qua non of experiential learning. In sum, learners are o ﬀered  autonomy and are empowered to make decisions (Barron et al., 2017 ; Dorfsman & Horenczyk, 2018 ). Learners may negotiate solutions through creative means, the outcome of which cannot be pre- dicted at the start of the learning process. Learners often complete problem-solving activities in smallteams. Gibbons et al. ( 2018 ) example that “Typically, participants work in groups of six to eight on physically challenging tasks that require elements of communication, cooperation, trust, and risk ” (p. 3). Isaak et al. ( 2018 ) discuss a “sense of connection ”(p. 34) as learners work
In particular, Collins et al. ( 2016 ) point out that the process involves the solving of ill-structured problems, which is positioned as a critical competence in contemporary complex societies. They identify three important aspects: creativity, tolerance for novelty, and cognitive ﬂexibility, in which adaptability is a central feature, which enables the bridging between theory and practice (Barnes, 2016 ). 4.3. Revision to Kolb ’s model The aim of the present study was to understand how educators interpret the meaning of a “concrete experience ”. In the studies examined, concrete experience represented highly contextualized, primary, experience that involves hands-on learner experience in uncontrived real-world situations. This is contrary to D. A. Kolb ’s(1984 ,2015 ) own conceptualization that experiential learning refers to“the individual learning process that applied in all situations and arenas of life, a holistic process of learning ”(2015 , p. xx). This ﬁnding represents a clear and important di ﬀerence in the conceptualiz- ation of what constitutes a concrete experience and seemingly warrants a revision to Kolb ’s learning cycle ( Figure 2 ). The present paper did provide support for four dimensions of experiential learning, as per D. A. Kolb’s model ( 1984 ). The ﬁve themes identi ﬁed in the analysis coupled closely with Kolb’ s four dimensions (refer to ﬁgure 1 ), with however some very subtle but signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences, which are summarized in Figure 2 . These seemingly very important di ﬀerences are explained further in the following sections. As noted in the methodology section of the present report, the data organization was complicated by the overlapping of the data into the themes identi ﬁed. In this regard, themes, which are rep- resented in the proposed model ( Figure 2 ), were clearly very organically adjoined, which addresses Miettinen ’s(2000 ) concern of Kolb ’s model that its dimensions do not couple in a very organic or necessary way.
) concern of Kolb ’s model that its dimensions do not couple in a very organic or necessary way. Moreover, the proposed model takes into account graphical syntax issues highlighted by Bergstei- ner et al. ( 2010 ) that (1) in accepted modeling practice time-lines should represent activities, and (2) simpli ﬁcation of the model can be achieved by removing the horizontal and vertical bidirectional arrows on Kolb ’s model, which merely highlights orthogonal bipolar relationships between active experimentation and re ﬂective observation, and concrete experience and abstract conceptualization (Figure 2 ). The proposed changes to the Kolb model are detailed in the following sections. 4.3.1. Concrete experience In the studies examined in the present report, learners were involved, active, engaged, participants in the learning process. Learners were placed physically, often in collaboration with others, in Contextually rich concrete  experience Critical  reflective  observation  Contextual-specific abstract  conceptualizationPragmatic active  experimentation Figure 2. Experiential learning cycle (a revision to D. A. Kolb ’s1984 model).1070 T. H. MORRIS
contextually rich learning environments that represented in the present moment, uncontrived, “hands on ”, real-world primary concrete experiences (e.g. Grimwood et al., 2018 ; Larsen, 2017 ; Schary & Waldron, 2017 ). The idea of a “contextually rich ”concrete experience (refer to Figure 2 ) actually falls against Kolb ’s own conceptualization of experiential learning theory, who rather viewed concrete experiences as experiences that occur in “all situations and arenas of life ”(D. A. Kolb, 2015 , p. xx) that come through the sensory cortex (A. Y. Kolb & Kolb, 2013 ). An important distinction between the model proposed in the present paper and the Kolb model, concerning the interpretation of what is considered a concrete experience in experiential learning theory, is highlighted in one theme in the data of the present report: that knowledge is situated in context: emphasizing place (including community, cultural, societal, and/or social aspects) andtime (present and/or historical). A key aspect of the learning process concerns learners learning to appreciate that knowledge is situated in context: ﬂuid across time and place. Again, the need for learning to be situated in context was not stipulated in D. A. Kolb ’s conceptualization of experiential learning ( 1984 ,2015 ). However, the present research report found that, rather, experiential learning is conceptualized by educators and scholars as a process in which learners are immersed in learning experiences thatcontain the fullest contextual information possible, in which the experiential learning process takes place. In this regard, Jarvis ( 2012 ), in particular, voiced a clear critique of D. A. Kolb ’s model: that it does not take into consideration the social context of learning. Again, the studies examined in the presentpaper highlighted that the social context of learning has a central place in experiential learning theory. For example, in examining experiential learning from a socio-spatial perspective,
learning theory. For example, in examining experiential learning from a socio-spatial perspective, Pipitone and Raghavan ( 2017 ) identi ﬁed meaning-making as both a “participatory and collaborative process mediated through the body and embedded within social, spatial, and temporal realities ”(p. 265) and it is through our body ’s senses that we are able to experience place. Embodiment is a central consequence of immersing learners physically in the learning space. This is a key area for further research, which is discussed in more detail in the conclusions of the presentreport. 4.3.2. Re ﬂective observation D. A. Kolb ( 1984 ,2015 ) did not stress the need for “critical ”reﬂection in his conceptualization of experiential learning: he did not di ﬀerentiate between the requirement for critical or non-critical reﬂection during the learning process. However, it became clear in the present study that the solving of problems in context stipulates the need for critical re ﬂection. Indeed, some authors (e.g. Harper, 2018 ) acknowledged that their course of experiential learning was informed by critical theory (Brook ﬁeld,2001 ; Mezirow, 1981 ). In this regard, the studies analyzed in the present report highlighted that critical reﬂective obser- vation is essential in the process ( Figure 2 ), which acts as a mediator of meaning-making. In the process, learners must act in an investigator-like manner and test the ﬁttingness of new or pre-exist- ing abstract conceptualizations against the present moment real-world experience (cf. Barron et al., 2017 ). That is, in order to e ﬀectively solve problems situated in a context that are posed during the learn- ing process, considering the details of the conditions of the context seems imperative because pro-blems are inherently context speci ﬁc (cf. Langer, 2017 ). In the studies examined in the present paper, problems were authentic, but also generally open-ended (Scogin et al., 2017 ), with a purposeful aim (Breunig, 2017 ),
but also generally open-ended (Scogin et al., 2017 ), with a purposeful aim (Breunig, 2017 ), where there was a need for learners to be comfortable with ambiguity and uncer- tainty (Ricke, 2018 ). This may be understood further in terms of the Socratic concept that learners may approach the learning situation with a stance that all knowledge is provisional: learners may appreciate that theyINTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 1071
do not yet “know”and that solutions to problems in a real-world context are context speci ﬁc (cf. Scott, 2018 ). Through experiential learning, learners may begin to appreciate the ﬂuidity of contex- tual-conditions across place and time and become comfortable with change and uncertainty (cf. Langer, 2017 ). Indeed, in remodeling Dewey ’s theory on experience and re ﬂective thought and action, Miettinin (2000 ) interprets Dewey ’s ideas in a di ﬀerent way to D. A. Kolb: depicting a process of learning that includes deﬁ ning the problem and studying the conditions of the problem situation in order to for- mulate a working hypothesis. The model presented by Miettinin ( 2000 ) is seemingly complementary to the model proposed in the present paper and may, in addition, assist readers to understand themeaning of experiential learning. 4.3.3. Abstract conceptualization Resultant from critical re ﬂection on contextually rich concrete experience, the present model pro- poses that abstract conceptualizations may construe critically, that is, contextual-speci ﬁc(Figure 2 ). Again, D. A. Kolb ( 1984 ,2015 ) did not make the distinction between the formation of uncritically or critically assimilated abstract conceptualizations. Conversely, the proposed model predicts that in order for the model to operate as a spiral, with increasing complexity as a human develops andmatures, contextual-speci ﬁcabstract conceptualizations are mandatory. A key aspect of this concerns learners learning to appreciate that the conditions of the context may change across time and place and therefore all knowledge is provisional and needs testing incontext. This could be conceptualized as a “working hypothesis ”(as per Dewey ’s ideas, described in Miettinin, 2000 ), which when passed through active experimentation in new concrete experiences they become, potentially, higher order concepts. The importance of appreciating that abstract conceptualizations construe as contextual-speci ﬁci n experiential
of appreciating that abstract conceptualizations construe as contextual-speci ﬁci n experiential learning theory (critically assimilated), rather than contextual-indi ﬀerent (uncritically assimilated), is found in critical theory. Mezirow ’s(1978 ,1981 ,1991 ) work highlights that when abstract conceptualizations are uncritically assimilated, we get “caught in our own history and are reliving it ”(1978 , p. 101; readers are encouraged to read further in this regard: Mezirow, 1991 ). This form of learning may actually limit a person ’s growth potential toward becoming the person they could be (cf. Arnold, 2017 ). In this regard, it is possible to plot a very di ﬀerent alternative learning cycle which involves (1) con- textually-poor experience (2) uncritical re ﬂective observation (3) contextual-indi ﬀerent abstract con- ceptualization, and (4) reinforcing/repeating active experimentation. Rather than a spiral, this cycle would represent a circle, where actions are repeated and would, rather, complement behaviorist epis- temology (cf. Murtonen et al., 2017 ). Indeed, it seems important to point out that experiential learning theory does not capture all forms of human learning; and probably no learning model will ever do so (Merriam, Ca ﬀarella, & Baumgartner, 2007 ). 4.3.4. Active experimentation A key potential bene ﬁto fcontextual-speci ﬁcabstract conceptualizations is that they may enable lear- ners to act pragmatically –to base their actions on their concrete experiences –in active experimen- tation with an encounter with a new concrete experience. In other words, this involves testing the ﬁttingness of abstract conceptualizations formulated against new concrete experiences. Indeed, Roberts ( 2018 ) explains that a central tenet of experiential learning is found in the etymol- ogy of the word “experience ”, which means “to test ”,o r“to risk ”in Latin. In this regard, the process integrally involves risk, as experiential learning incorporates novel, challenging,
the process integrally involves risk, as experiential learning incorporates novel, challenging, experiences. Learnersmust respond to, accept the challenge of, and behave with spontaneity to the unpredictability that is inherent in the process. It should be considered that experiential learning is a process that deliberately places learners out of their comfort zones and, consequently, learners may learn to appreciate that conditions change,1072 T. H. MORRIS
sometimes very discretely, across time and place. Bailey et al. ( 2017 ) discuss that novelty and chal- lenge, inherent in experiential learning, facilitates the process of inducing cognitive dissonance, as learners are challenged and “destabilized ”(cf. Glazier et al., 2017 ; McGowan, 2016 ). It was clear in the analysis of the present paper that experiential learning is a process in which the concrete experiences “push the edges of what they [the learners] are familiar with ”(Grimwood et al., 2018 , p. 9). Wainwright et al. ( 2017 ) discuss that immersion in a new place or space is one aspect that induces unfamiliarity. D. A. Kolb ( 1984 ) did acknowledge that active experimentation involves utilizing “theories to make decisions and solve problems ”(p. 30). However, the model proposed in the present paper ( Figure 2 ) makes the distinction, which was not made by D. A. Kolb ( 1984 ,2015 ), that because, in the real-world, problems are inherently contextual-speci ﬁc and ill-structured learners must become accustomed to considering the conditions in which problems are situated; in order to facilitate learners to progress successfully, in a spiral of learning, toward maturation and growth. 5. Conclusions and future works The present study provides a rich insight into how educators may conceptualize and facilitate the concept of experiential learning (refer to Figure 1 for a summary of themes). The ﬁndings warranted subtle but key adjustments to D. A. Kolb’s( 1984 ,2015 ) learning cycle ( Figure 2 ), which are proposed as important considerations in further works on experiential learning theory. The revision to Kolb ’s model proposed addresses many key critiques that: there is a shortage of a sound empirical foundation to the model (e.g. Co ﬃeld et al., 2004 ; Miettinen, 2000 ), the dimensions of the model do not connect to each other cohesively (e.g. Jarvis, 2012 ; Miettinen, 2000 ), and the model typology lacks clarity (Bergsteiner et al., 2010 ). There were some --- 2000 ), and the model typology lacks clarity (Bergsteiner et al., 2010 ). There were some weaknesses of the present study. In particular, although the systematic nature of the study allowed a rich insight into how educators conceptualize and facilitate experiential learningin practice, most studies reviewed were limited to contexts that represented out-of-classroom experience. There may be multiple reasons for this, including that physically getting out of the classroom may assist to facilitate experiential learning. In this case, examining the factors that encourage or discou-rage out-of-classroom experience seems essential. Moreover, publication bias toward what is seen as experiential learning cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, many of the studies analyzed were conducted in North America. This is an important consideration because it is possible that there are di ﬀerential conceptualizations of experiential learn- ing in di ﬀerent contexts. Moreover, studying the factors that limit the facilitation of experiential learn- ing was not an aim of the present study but is an important area for future research. Empirical testing of the proposed model is required, with potentially further revisions. Further studies may focus to address other critiques, which was not possible in the present research;especially concerns of further modeling issues, including whether the arrows should be bidirectional rather than unidirectional and whether concrete experience should be assigned as the starting point (cf. Jarvis, 2012 ). Furthermore, the complexity of the experiential learning process (as depicted in Figure 1 ) should not be taken for granted. In this regard, further research could consider the facilitation of experientiallearning from an educator ’s perspective, including how to train educator competence to facilitate experiential learning. Moreover, another key area for further research concerns how over time one ’s learning spiral may become more complex, as a human
further research concerns how over time one ’s learning spiral may become more complex, as a human develops and matures. In this regard, some scholars in the ﬁeld of experiential learning have realized the need to appreciate complementary knowledge in the ﬁeld of cognitive sciences (e.g. Schenck & Cruickshank, 2015 ). Speciﬁcally, as identi ﬁed in the present paper, embodiment that accompanies the experiential learning process represents a very important focus for further studies. Embodiment is a relativelyINTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 1073 --- underdeveloped area of research in educational and cognitive sciences (refer to Dijkerman & Leng- genhager, 2018 ; Kiefer & Trumpp, 2012 , for reviews). Further studies should appreciate the recent ﬁndings from cognitive sciences that suggests that embodiment is an essential part of fostering a learner ’s deep conceptual understanding. In particular, in a review article Kiefer and Trumpp ( 2012 ) discuss that over the last decades scholars wrongly assumed that when perceptual and motor systems coded knowledge in abstract-symbolic format, modality-speci ﬁc sensory-motor information was lost. Rather, there is surmounting evidence that cognition is, vitally, based on reinstatements of sensing (using the relevant sensory organs), and/or feeling/acting (using the motor/proprioceptive organs) that accompanied the original experience. Thus, when learners are immersed, with their body , in a contextually rich experience, sensory- motor information becomes embodied in memory traces. It is thought that embodiment is essential for deep conceptual understanding and “for human cognition to develop at the highest level ”(Kiefer & Trumpp, 2012 , p. 19). In other words, potentially, to secure deep and meaningful learning the body cannot be decoupled from the mind during the process of learning. Indeed, in some educational contexts, such as in the vocational education and training of adults in the Netherlands, there has been a shift away from domain-speci ﬁc knowledge taught in classrooms (mind work, no body work) exactly because it has been realized that such education does not fosterlearners ’deep conceptual understanding of workplace knowledge and skills (cf. Biemans et al., 2004 ; Descy & Tessaring, 2002 ; Jossberger et al., 2010 ,2018 ). In this regard, experiential learning is a particular form of learning that, in addition to the many other possible learner bene ﬁts gained from the process detailed in the present paper, has much potential to foster learners ’deep conceptual
the process detailed in the present paper, has much potential to foster learners ’deep conceptual understanding. Experiential learning is potentially appli- cable, but to date perhaps hugely unrealized, in a wide variety of educational contexts.

El artículo de Morris aborda la teoría del aprendizaje experiencial, destacando la ambigüedad en la interpretación de "experiencia concreta" en el modelo de Kolb. Para clarificar este concepto, se realizó una revisión sistemática de la literatura, identificando cinco temas clave:

1. **Participación activa de los aprendices**: Los aprendices son vistos como participantes activos en su aprendizaje.
   
2. **Conocimiento situado**: El aprendizaje es contextual y está influenciado por el entorno.

3. **Exposición a experiencias novedosas**: Las situaciones nuevas y desafiantes son fundamentales para el aprendizaje.

4. **Indagación sobre problemas del mundo real**: Los estudiantes enfrentan problemas reales, aplicando sus conocimientos en contextos prácticos.

5. **Reflexión crítica como mediadora**: La reflexión crítica es esencial para un aprendizaje significativo.

A partir de estos hallazgos, Morris propone una revisión del modelo de Kolb, sugiriendo que el aprendizaje experiencial debe incluir experiencias concretas ricas en contexto, observación reflexiva crítica, conceptualización abstracta específica del contexto y experimentación activa pragmática. Se concluye que se requieren más estudios empíricos para validar el modelo revisado.

El artículo también menciona que, a pesar de la relevancia del aprendizaje experiencial, ha habido poca investigación empírica al respecto, aunque en los últimos 20 años ha aumentado significativamente. Se destaca la importancia de profundizar en la comprensión del aprendizaje experiencial y cómo facilitarlo, dado que existen limitaciones en la teoría actual.

El texto también aborda la crítica al modelo de Kolb, señalando que las fases del ciclo de aprendizaje no están interconectadas de manera orgánica. Se discuten las críticas de Miettinen y otros académicos sobre la falta de fundamentos teóricos y empíricos sólidos en el modelo de Kolb.

El estudio se centra en la interpretación de "experiencia concreta", destacando la discrepancia entre diferentes educadores sobre lo que constituye una experiencia válida. Se plantea la necesidad de clarificar estas definiciones en el contexto de entornos de aprendizaje interactivos.

**Metodología**: Se realizó un análisis temático inductivo basado en una revisión sistemática de la literatura, seleccionando 60 artículos relevantes. Se utilizó el software MAXQDA10 para organizar y codificar los datos.

El texto también presenta un análisis sistemático de diversas publicaciones relacionadas con programas educativos en diferentes contextos, destacando la diversidad de enfoques y la importancia de la educación experiencial en el desarrollo social y personal.

Finalmente, se subraya la necesidad de investigar cómo el ciclo de aprendizaje de un individuo puede volverse más complejo con el tiempo y cómo capacitar a los educadores para facilitar el aprendizaje experiencial. Se menciona la importancia de la encarnación en el aprendizaje, sugiriendo que la cognición se basa en la reinstauración de experiencias sensoriales y motoras.

En resumen, el artículo de Morris ofrece una revisión crítica del aprendizaje experiencial y su aplicación en la educación, proponiendo un modelo revisado que busca abordar las limitaciones del modelo de Kolb y enfatizando la necesidad de una mayor investigación en este campo.
