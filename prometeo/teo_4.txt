Gramsci on Bureaucracy FRANCESCA ANTONINI Moritz-Stern-Institut, Georg-August-Universit €at G€ottingen, G€ottingen, Germany This essay reconstructs Antonio Gramsci ’s account of bureaucracy as it unfolds in his magnum opus, the Prison Notebooks .B ya d o p t i n gt h e “philological ”way of reading this work developed in recent decades by Gramsci scholars and significantly anticipated by Joseph Buttigieg ’s “Gramsci ’sM e t h o d ”(1990), I show how the concept of bureaucracy is closely connected to some key elements in Gramsci ’s political reflections, such as the categories of “hegemony ”and “organic crisis. ”While drawing out the “constellation ”of Gramsci ’s references to bureaucratic apparatuses throughout his carceral writings, I stress in particular their relationship withhis investigation of the nature and the role of political parties, as well as with his overall assessment of parliamentarism (and of its degeneration). In this framework, a further pivotal element is represented by Gramsci ’sc o n c e p t i o n of“modernity, ”that is, of the features that characterize the contemporary political panorama and to which the issue of bureaucracy is closely related. To conclude, I compare Gramsci ’s and Max Weber ’st h e o r i e so fb u r e a u c r a c y , showing both similarities and differences.

(See especially the debatebetween Anderson 1976 and Francioni 1984 , renewed in Thomas 2009 .) Far from being solely a matter of form, these debates also pertain to content,leading to different interpretations of Gramsci ’s intellectual legacy.

Thanks to Buttigieg ’s efforts, as well as to those of other scholars, there is now a well-established method of interpreting Gramsci ’s pre-prison articles and especially the prison notes as an incomplete and multi-layered oeuvre , which requires careful attention from commentators.1In a certain sense, we can say that Gramsci ’s unique way of writing in prison ( “Gramsci ’s method ”) and the approach toward his work adopted by scholars are opposed. The moreGramsci ’s thinking is uncertain and provisional (involving rewriting, additions, and other changes), the more Gramscian critique has to be painstaking and sensitive to small textual clues. The more Gramsci ’s sources and reminiscences are vague, the more the scholars have to reconstruct meticulously the cultural and political context he evoked. 2 In the present essay, I adopt the methodology developed in recent decades by Gramsci scholars to reflect on an interesting but still under-explored category in Gramsci ’s thought, that of bureaucracy.3For reasons of space, I will focus only on thePrison Notebooks , where the category of bureaucracy plays a particularly important role. By analyzing the notes in which Gramsci adopts this term and other related concepts, I will show how the category of bureaucracy unfolds in the carceral writings, and how it connects to some key elements in Gramsci ’s political reflections. In the first section, I investigate the Gramscian analysis of bureaucracy as part of the state institutions. Section two deals with the specific features of bureaucratic apparatuses ( “professionalism, ”backwardness, and separation from the people). The relationship between bureaucracy and political parties and the parliamentary system are at stake in Sections 4 and 5. In Section 6 ,I concentrate on Gramsci ’s account of modernity, examining the connection between bureaucracy and contemporary political phenomena. The closing section contains a brief comparison between Gramsci ’s and Weber ’s theories of
The closing section contains a brief comparison between Gramsci ’s and Weber ’s theories of bureaucracy. 2. Bureaucracy as Institution The first and most immediate meaning of “bureaucracy ”that we can trace in theNotebooks refers to the administrative body of a state, that is, the group of non-elected officers who are in charge of the functioning of public institutions. With this denotation, the term already appears in Notebook 1, in the context of Gramsci ’s analysis of late nineteenth-century France and of Maurras ’Action Franc ¸aise (Gramsci 1975 , Q1§48, 60). The strength and breadth of the bureaucratic apparatuses are here depicted as long-term features of the French state, as well as sources of stability against attempts by monarchists and clericalists to overthrow the established political system. The French bureaucratic tradition is a motif that also returns in later texts (see, for instance, Gramsci 1975 , Q6§114, 784 –785). On this basis, Gramsci highlights the distance between Italy and France, mostly in relation to the state-building process, opposing French centralization to Italian fragmentation (see, for instance, Gramsci 1975 , Q5§126, 654 –656). From this perspective, GramsciGRAMSCI ON BUREAUCRACY 17
also stresses the differences between French-inspired Piedmont and the rest of the Italian peninsula (see Gramsci 1975 , Q2§121, 259 –262).4 Gramsci ’s historiographical interests are also closely related to his comments on the sociopolitical scenario that lies behind the bureaucratic construction of state institutions. Bureaucracy reflects the power relations that characterize eachnation and its class composition (Gramsci 1975 , Q9§71, 1142 –1143). Given that bureaucracy originates for the most part from the bourgeoisie and itssubgroups, a solid bourgeois regime corresponds to a “healthy ”bureaucracy. Inversely, behind weak political rule there are malfunctioning bureaucraticapparatuses. The comparison of different countries is illuminating. Whereas inFrance the middle class is broad and strong (Gramsci 1975 , Q5§119, 638 –639), in Germany the bureaucracy is derived from the Junkers, who are defined as“mummificata e mutilata ”as a social class, although still self-conscious (Gramsci 1975 , Q14§47, 1705). In Italy, bureaucrats mostly arose from the impoverished and parasitical rural bourgeoisie, which has a “non-national ”and selfish character (Gramsci 1975 , Q3§46, 324 –325). 5 The theme of the class origins of the bureaucracy is relevant because of its connection with the issue of hegemony. Bureaucratic apparatuses are indeedessential in establishing and maintaining a regime, and they deal in “coercion ” as well as “consent. ”This also explains Gramsci ’s focus on the twofold nature of bureaucracy, which is both civil and military. 6This double characterization precociously emerges and capitalizes on the distinction between military andpolitical leadership, between the technical-military element and the military-political one (Gramsci 1975 , Q1§114, 101 –102; Q1§117, 110 –111). The latter is key for Gramsci ’s account of bureaucracy, since it plays a role in the hegemonic process. In order to evaluate this double nature, Gramsci considersnot only its “actual
hegemonic process. In order to evaluate this double nature, Gramsci considersnot only its “actual ”state, but also its “potentiality, ”i.e. the role of the “strati sociali da cui, in quel determinato complesso statale, questi elementitradizionalmente sono reclutati ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q4§66, 509). 3. Bureaucracy as Profession While developing these general historical and sociological remarks, Gramsci also focuses on the specific features of bureaucracy, which appears as a specialized and conservative force, detached from the popular masses. The theme of the“specialism ”of bureaucracy is crucial in the context of modernity: “Il fatto che nello svolgimento storico delle forme politiche ed economiche si sia venutoformando il tipo del funzionario ‘di carriera ’, tecnicamente addestrato al lavoro burocratico (civile e militare) ha un significato primordiale nella scienza politicae nella storia delle forme statali ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q13§36, 1632). 7Gramsci first investigates bureaucracy ’s“specialism ”in connection with the issue of education and its reform (Gramsci 1975 , Q4§50, 485 –488; Q6§179, 825 –826). Its political consequences, however, are far more relevant.18 F.ANTONINI
Like Gramsci ’s bitter criticisms of officers ’overspecialization (and of the “decadence ”of specialization),8his focus on the conservative attitude that derives from this professionalism is noteworthy. Given their lifelong assignments, state functionaries are naturally keen to maintain the status quo. Thus, bureaucrats historically back the ruling classes (Gramsci 1975 , Q2§29, 184 –186; see also Gramsci 1975 , Q1§116, 103 –110; Q6§162, 814 –816). However, this conservatism can degenerate. Far from being simply “traditional, ”the bureaucratic apparatuses embody the most backward tendencies or, as Gramsci says, “la forza consuetudenaria pi /C18u pericolosa ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q7§77, 910), which can impede the progressive development of the country (Gramsci 1975 , Q15§39, 1794 –1798; Q23§32, 2218 –2226). From this point of view, Gramsci ’s lexicon is self-explanatory, as when he talks about the “mummification ”and “fossilization ”of culture (see, for instance, Gramsci 1975 , Q1§133, 122).9 According to Gramsci, the conservatism of the bureaucracy follows from its detachment from the people. Discussing the lack of hegemony in post- Risorgimento Italy, Gramsci argues that “la burocrazia cos /C18ısi estraniava dal paese, e attraverso le posizioni amministrative, diventava un vero partito politico, il peggiore di tutti, perch /C19e la gerarchia burocratica sostituiva la gerarchia intellettuale e politica: la burocrazia diventava appunto il partito statale-bonapartistico ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q3§119, 387). This feature is emphasized in the following notes through an analogy with “caste. ”If Gramsci defines bureaucracy as the “cristallizzazione del personale dirigente che esercita il potere coercitivo e che a un certo punto diventa casta ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q6§81, 752), he also writes that “l’elemento burocratico, civile, ma specialmente militare, ha le maggiori tendenze allo spirito di corpo, che conduce alla formazione di ‘caste’”(Gramsci 1975 , Q8§81, 987). This last text further
corpo, che conduce alla formazione di ‘caste’”(Gramsci 1975 , Q8§81, 987). This last text further enriches Gramsci ’s imagery by adopting the category of “esprit de corps ”alongside that of caste, where the latter appears as a degeneration of the former. Moreover, these observations seem to anticipate his later investigations of “sectarianism ”and“fetishism ”(on these categories, see Antonini 2020 , 378–382). On a general level, Gramsci ’s analysis of the distance between the bureaucracy and the masses evokes a key theme in the Notebooks , that of the intellectuals and their separation from the people (Frosini 2011 ). This linkage is explicitly suggested in Q4§33 (452), where the terminology of “caste”/“priesthood ” occurs again and, then, in Q5§38 and Q5§120, on officers ’literary works (571, 639–640). However, the (dis-)connection between bureaucracy and the masses also returns implicitly in other notes, inasmuch as Gramsci enlarges the category of the “intellectual ”and turns cultural issues into political issues (see, for instance, Gramsci 1975 , Q9§21, 1109). 10 4. Bureaucracy and Political Parties Gramsci ’s reference to the intellectuals displays the political potential of the category of bureaucracy, which is also closely connected to the nature ofGRAMSCI ON BUREAUCRACY 19
modern political parties and to parliamentarism. The first theme is raised in Q2§75, where Gramsci, dwelling on Robert Michels ’s thought (influenced by Weber), discusses the “complessivit /C18a progressiva del mestiere politico, ”which requires “capi dei partiti ”to“diventare sempre pi /C18u professionisti ”and gain “pratica burocratica ”(236)11Here Gramsci is referring to the specialization of politicians, that is, to the technical competences required by contemporary politics, and, most significantly, to their increasing detachment from the popular masses. Gramsci follows the quoted passage with observations on the contradiction between “le dichiarazioni e le intenzioni democratiche e la realt /C18a oligarchica ”existing within advanced parties (see also the above-mentioned passage —Gramsci 1975 , Q7§77, 910 —where Gramsci describes the party leadership in negative terms as the “burocrazia o stato maggiore del partito ”). Bureaucracy, in the context of the party, therefore means its “degeneration, ” the betrayal of its democratic aims by the leadership. Gramsci uses the term “bureaucratic party ”first of all to characterize misleading tendencies within the workers ’movement. This emerges openly, for instance, in Q4§31 (447 –451). On the one hand, Gramsci criticizes Georges Sorel, who bluntly classifies Marxism either as “proudhoniano ”or as “ortodosso ”and, therefore, “burocratico ”(having in mind only the case of the German SPD). On the other, he calls Henri De Man “un esemplare pedantesco della burocrazia laborista belga. ”12Boris Souvarine ’s bureaucratic conception of historical materialism is also at stake elsewhere (Gramsci 1975 , Q7§43, 891 –892). Moreover, bureaucracy is linked to Gramsci ’s reassessment of the concept of “centralism. ”In debates at the time, this category describes the highly centralized organization of communist parties. In the Italian context, it was adopted especially by Amadeo Bordiga (leader of the Italian Communist Party between
context, it was adopted especially by Amadeo Bordiga (leader of the Italian Communist Party between 1921 and 1924) and, as such, harshly criticized in the Notebooks .13In fact, Gramsci rejects “centralismo organico ”/C18al aBordiga, stressing its sectarian, top-down features (Gramsci 1975 , Q3§56, 337; but see also Q4§31, 447 –451 and Q6§128, 796). This type of centralism is opposed to a positive, “centralismo democratico, ”as explained in Q9§68 (1138 –1140). In this text from Notebook 9, however, Gramsci changes his mind and reconsiders the category of organic centralism (although his refusal of Bordiga ’s policy is still retained). From this point onward, the “bad”version of centralism will be the “bureaucratic ”one, while the adjective “organic ”acquires a positive meaning (in the sense of “consistent, well organized ”). This characterization is emphasized in the following notes, and notably in his later political reflections (see Notebooks 14, 15, and 17). From this point of view, a pivotal text is Q14§34, where the opposition between organic “democratic centralism ”and “bureaucratic centralism ”is used to explain the political party ’s two antithetical ways of functioning. Thus, Gramsci states: “quando il partito /C18e progressivo esso funziona ‘democraticamente ’(nel senso di un centralismo democratico), quando il partito /C18e regressivo esso funziona ‘burocraticamente ’(nel senso di un centralismo burocratico) ”(1692).1420 F.ANTONINI
5. Bureaucracy and Parliamentarism In this way, Gramsci ’s references to bureaucracy in the context of his broader understanding of the representative principle —and of parliamentarism as an expression of this principle —are also clarified. The opposition between bureaucracy and parliamentarism dates back to an early stage of his analysis. As he stresses already in Q4§49, the legislative power has to keep the bureaucracy under control: if the latter takes over, the representative principle vanishes, anddemocracy disappears (474 –484). This can also be seen in Q6§79, where the absence of real democracy is the counterpart of the “dispotismo ”of bureaucracy (751), or in Q6§81, where bureaucracy is described as the source of the weakness of liberalism: “la fonte della debolezza del liberalismo …/C18el a burocrazia, cio /C18e la cristallizzazione del personale dirigente che esercita il potere coercitivo e che a un certo punto diventa casta ”(752). Further examples could also be mentioned. 15 If these reflections apply to several nineteenth-century countries, they describe even more aptly the situation in the 1930s and the “organic crisis ”or, as Gramsci also says, the “crisis of authority ”or“crisis of hegemony. ”16Gramsci thoroughly analyzes the political aspects of this “interregnum ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q3§34, 311–312). In the advanced phase of his work, showing a significant affinity with contemporary reflections, he focuses on the crisis of the representative principle, that is on the “dissoluzione del regime parlamentare, ”as he defines it (Gramsci 1975 , Q13§37, 1637).17The most explicit manifestations of this crisis are the multiplication of parties and their weakness, as well as growing difficulties in forming governments. Gramsci synthesizes this situation by noting the absence of an“indirizzo politico permanente ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q15§47, 1807). Consequently, parliamentary groups behave in a “bureaucratic ”way, detached from the masses and with a concern only for
groups behave in a “bureaucratic ”way, detached from the masses and with a concern only for their personal interests (see, on this point, Gramsci 1975 , Q15§48, 1809: “i partiti sono sostituiti da camarille e influssi personali non confessabili ”).18Bureaucracy is thus a metaphor for the crisis of politics that characterizes Gramsci ’s time. Gramsci summarizes this situation by affirming that “il parlamentarismo /C18e divenuto inefficiente e anzi dannoso, ”and that “/C18e da vedere se parlamentarismo e regime rappresentativo si identificano e se non sia possibile una diversa soluzione sia del parlamentarismo che del regime burocratico, con un nuovo tipo di regime rappresentativo ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q14§49, 1708). 6. Bureaucracy and Modernity In the light of this opposition between bureaucracy and the representative principle, the meaning of Gramsci ’s remarks about the “democratic-bureaucratic ” features of contemporary politics is also clear (see Gramsci 1975 , Q8§22, 953–954; Q12§1, 1513 –1540). The compound adjective “democratic- bureaucratic ”is used to describe the unique mix represented by twentieth-centuryGRAMSCI ON BUREAUCRACY 21
autocratic regimes, notably Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.19Whereas “democratic ”points to the involvement of popular masses in the political processes (through, for instance, propaganda and plebiscites), the term “bureaucratic, ”rather than simply describing the role of bureaucratic apparatuses within these systems, highlights the collapse of the principle of representation and the subsequent absence of hegemony —at least conceived of in the traditional sense. Hegemony, in the interwar period, indeed has a new meaning; Frosini fruitfully discusses a form of “‘post-Jacobin ’hegemony. ”20Alongside the mobilization of large groups of people, this implies their control by authorities that seek to “organize ”consensus —and consequently, the blurring of the distinction between the private and public spheres. It is not by chance that, already in Q6§138, Gramsci describes an “concentrazione inaudita dell’egemonia ”(802). These changes are summarized by his overall reading of this situation as a “totalitarian ”one.21 We can trace references to bureaucracy in different elements of Gramsci ’s analysis of this new political and ideological framework. Bureaucratic apparatuses are first mentioned during his investigation of Caesarism, which emerges from Q4§69 (513) and Q9§133 (1194 –1195).22In this latter note (later redrafted in Q13§27, 1619 –1622), Gramsci hints, in particular, at the “formarsi di vaste burocrazie statali e ‘private ’(politico-private, di partito e sindacali) ”(1195) These accompany Caesarist phenomena, enlarging the concept of bureaucracy.23Moreover, bureaucracy is also described as one of the “potenze oscure ”of Caesarism that attempt to overthrow liberal regimes (Gramsci 1975 , Q13§23, 1603). Gramsci analyzes a further aspect of bureaucracy in his discussion of so-called “statolatry. ”In Q3§61, this phenomenon is defined as a form of state worship, a confusion of the state itself with “burocrazia statale, ”which characterizes both initial phases of the
of the state itself with “burocrazia statale, ”which characterizes both initial phases of the state, but also, remarkably, its advanced and post- modern stages (340). Gramsci discusses “un determinato atteggiamento verso il ‘governo dei funzionari, ’”which implies the primacy of the state over civil society (Gramsci 1975 , Q8§130, 1020; see also Q8§142, 1028 –1029). In this context, the state functionaries, due to their innate conservatism and backwardness, are the symbol of the separation of the ruling class from the people and, thus, of the end of political representation. It has to be noted that this definition does not contradict Gramsci ’s enlargement of the category of bureaucracy described above (and, consequently, also of the state).24Rather, Gramsci connects the new political situation closely with the bureaucracy, by demonstrating also its complex nature. This“dispotismo …della burocrazia ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q6§79, 751) relies on the“passivit /C18a”of the popular masses (Gramsci 1975 , Q8§108, 1004), in an economic and, more significantly, a political sense. This issue also evokes Gramsci ’s broader reflections on the “apoliticism ”and“subversivism ”of the Italian people,25insofar as these phenomena result in a passive attitude toward these institutions. From this perspective, passivity is conceived both as a natural22 F.ANTONINI
feature of the Italian “type,”and also a consequence of the lack of hegemony that characterized Italy ’s history.26The theme of the passivity of the masses even more clearly recalls the category of “passive revolution, ”which represents the most advanced political conceptualization in Gramsci ’s prison writings. Elsewhere, however, Gramsci stresses that a response to this situation can be found in a complete reshaping of the political scenario, beginning with arefoundation of the political party and capitalizing on a new conception of discipline and personal initiative. 27In this framework, a “good”version of bureaucracy (which enhances true political representation) might be possible, too, as Gramsci seems to hypothesize in Q14§49 (1707 –1708). 7. Gramsci and Weber To conclude, I would like to compare (albeit very briefly) Gramsci ’s conceptualization with Weber ’s theory of bureaucracy, which is by far the most famous within political science. Such a confrontation with Weber ’s theory is necessary in any analysis of the theme and is particularly necessary in this framework.28Their accounts display both similarities and differences. In fact, Gramsci and Weber share a criticism of late nineteenth- and early twentieth- century liberal systems and a diagnosis of the contemporary crisis of politics. However, their investigations unfold along different lines, even if there is an interesting overlapping in their understanding of some themes, such as, for example, the professional character of the bureaucracy. On the one hand,Weber ’s rigorous sociological analysis focuses on transformations within the state organization and the degeneration of the democratic-representative principle. On the other hand, Gramsci writes in a less systematic way, given well-known carceral restrictions, with different aspects of the issue of bureaucracy, deepening in particular his reflections on its relationship withhegemony —on different levels; consider, for instance, his understanding of
on its relationship withhegemony —on different levels; consider, for instance, his understanding of centralism or the democratic-bureaucratic nature of modernity. The distance between the two authors is clarified when we examine their “solutions ”to this critical situation. From this point of view, they even appear antithetical. Weber ’s“dilemma ”—that is, the antithesis between democratic legitimacy and political effectiveness —is, as is well known, unsolvable; the only means of escape is through charismatic leadership, which, however, opens up a completely new political panorama. While Gramsci thoroughly investigates dictatorial scenarios, in history and in theory, he puts forward a revolutionary solution. This is embodied mainly in his proposal for the “modern prince, ”but it also finds stimulating developments in other strands of his thought, as this essay has outlined. Gramsci ’s account of bureaucracy is original and multi-layered, representing a valuable contribution to research on this issue. Finally, in the context of the Prison Notebooks in general, the concept of bureaucracy allows for the development of Gramsci ’s political thought from the early notebooks to his finalGRAMSCI ON BUREAUCRACY 23
notes. In its non-linearity and complexity, his analysis of bureaucratic apparatuses is a perfect example of what Buttigieg called “Gramsci ’s method. ” Notes 1 This reading draws on the most recent philological achievements of the scholarship,notably the new Italian critical edition of Gramsci ’s works, the Edizione nazionale degli scritti di Antonio Gramsci , which is currently being published. 2 In this regard, see Francioni ( 2009 ). 3 Useful though not exhaustive analyses of Gramsci ’s conception of bureaucracy can be found in Portantiero ( 1981 ,9–65), Filippini (entry in Liguori and Voza 2009 ,9 0–91), Filippini (2015 , 213ff), and Burgio ( 2007 ,2 5 9 ) . 4 Gramsci also depicts “Eastern ”countries, such as China and Japan, as deeply bureaucratic. On the Chinese “struttura burocratico-militare dello stato, ”see Gramsci 1975 , Q5§23, 558-559. On Japan, see Gramsci 1975 , Q5§50, 579-582; Q8§87, 992 and Q12§1, 1529. See also his comparison between the Chinese bureaucracy of the mandarins, the Italian bureaucratic apparatuses during the Risorgimento, and the bureaucracy of the Catholic Church (with the Papacy conceived of as the hidebound institution par excellence ) drawn in Gramsci 1975 , Q14§47, 1705. On the combination of feudalism and bureaucracy, see also Gramsci 1975 ,Q 8 § 4 0 : “vecchia Russia feudale e burocratica. ” 5 These observations partially recall Gramsci ’s pre-prison text on the Southern Question, butalso echo Marx ’sLumpenproletariat ; on these “sources, ”see Antonini ( 2021 ). 6 The expression “civil and military bureaucracy ” recurs frequently in the Notebooks ,s e e ,f o r instance, Gramsci 1975 , Q9§89, 1156. See also Q17§53, where he refers to the “impalcatura burocratico-militare ”of the Roman Empire (1949). 7 This note rewrites Q9§21, by expanding significantly on the content of the first draft text, especially regarding the characterization of bureaucracy. 8 Cf. Gramsci 1975 , Q1§122, 113, where he writes that “chi /C18e troppo
of bureaucracy. 8 Cf. Gramsci 1975 , Q1§122, 113, where he writes that “chi /C18e troppo minuzioso per professione, si burocratizza: vede l ’albero e non pi/C18u la foresta, il regolamento e non pi /C18ul a strategia. ”See also Q1§101, 95, where, while talking about the institutionalization andimpoverishment of the music festival of Piedigrotta and the transformations of their organizers into “officers, ”he evokes the French tale of the bouc fonctionnaire (on this, see Gramsci 2017, 237, fn. 457).9 On mummification and other related categories, see Jackson ( 2016 ) and Jackson ( 2019 ). Not by chance, “bureaucratize ”is used as a synonym of “fossilize ”; see Gramsci 1975 , Q6§84, 757. 10 On this pivotal point, see, among others, Thomas (2009). 11 On Michels and Weber, see Mommsen ( 1981 ). On Gramsci and Michels, see Basile ( 2016 ) and Bianchi ( 2019 ). Among Weber ’s works, Gramsci read Parliament and Government in Germany under a new Political Order (1918) and The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism , (the latter was published between 1931 and 1932 in the journal Nuovi studi di diritto, economia e politica ). Filippini ( 2015 , 214-215) argues that Gramsci ’s readings also included other Weberian texts, but his hypothesis is not very compelling. It is more likely that Gramsci knew Weber ’s thought indirectly through Michels ’writings. 12 On Gramsci and Sorel, see, for instance, Cavallari ( 2011 ). On Gramsci and De Man, see Mastellone ( 2001 ). 13 On this theme, see Cospito ( 2016 , 169ff). 14 On this note and, more generally, on the final miscellaneous notebooks, see Antonini ( 2019 ). 15 See Gramsci 1975 , Q6§40, where it is said that the English regime is not a representative one, since its parliament is not able to regulate the role of bureaucracy (714-715); Gramsci 1975 , Q6§86, where “l’abito diplomatico ”is described, with additions made later by Gramsci, “una professione subalterna, [subordinata, esecutivo- burocratica] ”(762); Gramsci 1975 ,Q
Gramsci, “una professione subalterna, [subordinata, esecutivo- burocratica] ”(762); Gramsci 1975 ,Q 8 § 5 2 :t h e “burocrazia [ …] deve essere controllata e guidata dalla classe politica ”(972). 16 On this theme, see Martin ( 2002 , 258), Burgio (2014 , 161ff) and Antonini ( 2016 ). 17 This expression (Gramsci does not adopt the expression “crisis of parliamentarism ”)i sa l r e a d y used in the first draft of this note (Gramsci 1975 , Q1§48, 60). In the context of the first half of the 1930s (Q13§37 is dated May 1932- November 1933), however, it assumes a deeper meaning. On the “crisis of parliamentarism ”in Gramsci, see Vacca ( 2017 , chap. 4) and Frosini (2017 ). This theme was widespread in public debates: in early 1933, e.g., the crisis of parliamentarism was a hot topic in Fascistjournals (although mostly with reference to German politics). As to the Notebooks ,G r a m s c i24 F.ANTONINI
deals with parliamentarism and its crisis especially in Notebook 14 and 15. 18 A further element of the transformation of parliamentarism in the twentieth-century contextis expressed by “black parliamentarism ”(an unofficial form of representation of the varietyof interests that continue to exist withintotalitarian contexts). On this theme, seeFrancioni ( 2020 )a n dA n t o n i n i( 2021 ). 19 There are also more or less implicit references to Soviet Russia —on Gramsci ’s“alternative modernities, ”see Vacca (2017). 20 See Frosini ( 2016a ). 21 On these transformations, see Antonini ( 2019 ). 22 See Gramsci 1975 , Q4§69: “questa situazione di contrasto tra rappresentati e rappresentanti,che dal terreno delle organizzazioni private(partiti o sindacati) non pu /C18o non riflettersinello Stato, rafforzando in modo formidabile il potere della burocrazia ”(513; then redrafted in Q13§23, 1602-1613). 23 Gramsci does the same with the “police ”—on this point, see Gramsci 1975 , Q13§27, 1619- 1622; Q14§34, 1691-1692; Q2§150, 278-279. 24 On this theme, see Buci-Glucksmann ( 1980 ) and Liguori ( 2015 ). 25 See Frosini ( 2016b ). 26 On these themes and their connection with bureaucracy, see also Gramsci 1975 , Q6§166, 818-819; Q8§142, 1028-1029. 27 See Antonini ( 2019 ). 28 Such a comparison is developed in Filippini (2015 ), on whose work I draw in part here. The bibliography on Weber is extensive. An interesting “Gramscian ”approach can be found in Rehmann ( 2014 ).

Gramsci on Bureaucracy FRANCESCA ANTONINI Moritz-Stern-Institut, Georg-August-Universit €at G€ottingen, G€ottingen, Germany This essay reconstructs Antonio Gramsci ’s account of bureaucracy as it unfolds in his magnum opus, the Prison Notebooks .B ya d o p t i n gt h e “philological ”way of reading this work developed in recent decades by Gramsci scholars and significantly anticipated by Joseph Buttigieg ’s “Gramsci ’sM e t h o d ”(1990), I show how the concept of bureaucracy is closely connected to some key elements in Gramsci ’s political reflections, such as the categories of “hegemony ”and “organic crisis. ”While drawing out the “constellation ”of Gramsci ’s references to bureaucratic apparatuses throughout his carceral writings, I stress in particular their relationship withhis investigation of the nature and the role of political parties, as well as with his overall assessment of parliamentarism (and of its degeneration). In this framework, a further pivotal element is represented by Gramsci ’sc o n c e p t i o n of“modernity, ”that is, of the features that characterize the contemporary political panorama and to which the issue of bureaucracy is closely related. To conclude, I compare Gramsci ’s and Max Weber ’st h e o r i e so fb u r e a u c r a c y , showing both similarities and differences. KEYWORDS bureaucracy, hegemony, modernity, political party, profession, Prison Notebooks , representative principle, Antonio Gramsci, Max Weber 1.“Gramsci ’s Method ” Among Gramsci scholars, the way to approach Gramsci ’s fragmentary works has been one of the most debated topics of discussion. (See especially the debatebetween Anderson 1976 and Francioni 1984 , renewed in Thomas 2009 .) Far from being solely a matter of form, these debates also pertain to content,leading to different interpretations of Gramsci ’s intellectual legacy. This is demonstrated in Joseph Buttigieg ’s path-breaking article “Gramsci ’s Method ” (1990 ), which represented a strong defense of the
’s path-breaking article “Gramsci ’s Method ” (1990 ), which represented a strong defense of the rationale for philology and textual criticism —methodologies that, especially in Anglophone scholarship, were not popular at that time, but that even nowadays are somewhat marginalto the mainstream. © 2022 American Association for Italian Studies DOI: 10.1080/01614622.2022.2060490ITALIAN CULTURE , Vol. 40 No. 1, March 2022, 16 –26 --- Thanks to Buttigieg ’s efforts, as well as to those of other scholars, there is now a well-established method of interpreting Gramsci ’s pre-prison articles and especially the prison notes as an incomplete and multi-layered oeuvre , which requires careful attention from commentators.1In a certain sense, we can say that Gramsci ’s unique way of writing in prison ( “Gramsci ’s method ”) and the approach toward his work adopted by scholars are opposed. The moreGramsci ’s thinking is uncertain and provisional (involving rewriting, additions, and other changes), the more Gramscian critique has to be painstaking and sensitive to small textual clues. The more Gramsci ’s sources and reminiscences are vague, the more the scholars have to reconstruct meticulously the cultural and political context he evoked. 2 In the present essay, I adopt the methodology developed in recent decades by Gramsci scholars to reflect on an interesting but still under-explored category in Gramsci ’s thought, that of bureaucracy.3For reasons of space, I will focus only on thePrison Notebooks , where the category of bureaucracy plays a particularly important role. By analyzing the notes in which Gramsci adopts this term and other related concepts, I will show how the category of bureaucracy unfolds in the carceral writings, and how it connects to some key elements in Gramsci ’s political reflections. In the first section, I investigate the Gramscian analysis of bureaucracy as part of the state institutions. Section two deals with the specific features of bureaucratic apparatuses ( “professionalism, ”backwardness, and separation from the people). The relationship between bureaucracy and political parties and the parliamentary system are at stake in Sections 4 and 5. In Section 6 ,I concentrate on Gramsci ’s account of modernity, examining the connection between bureaucracy and contemporary political phenomena. The closing section contains a brief comparison between Gramsci ’s and Weber ’s theories of
The closing section contains a brief comparison between Gramsci ’s and Weber ’s theories of bureaucracy. 2. Bureaucracy as Institution The first and most immediate meaning of “bureaucracy ”that we can trace in theNotebooks refers to the administrative body of a state, that is, the group of non-elected officers who are in charge of the functioning of public institutions. With this denotation, the term already appears in Notebook 1, in the context of Gramsci ’s analysis of late nineteenth-century France and of Maurras ’Action Franc ¸aise (Gramsci 1975 , Q1§48, 60). The strength and breadth of the bureaucratic apparatuses are here depicted as long-term features of the French state, as well as sources of stability against attempts by monarchists and clericalists to overthrow the established political system. The French bureaucratic tradition is a motif that also returns in later texts (see, for instance, Gramsci 1975 , Q6§114, 784 –785). On this basis, Gramsci highlights the distance between Italy and France, mostly in relation to the state-building process, opposing French centralization to Italian fragmentation (see, for instance, Gramsci 1975 , Q5§126, 654 –656). From this perspective, GramsciGRAMSCI ON BUREAUCRACY 17
also stresses the differences between French-inspired Piedmont and the rest of the Italian peninsula (see Gramsci 1975 , Q2§121, 259 –262).4 Gramsci ’s historiographical interests are also closely related to his comments on the sociopolitical scenario that lies behind the bureaucratic construction of state institutions. Bureaucracy reflects the power relations that characterize eachnation and its class composition (Gramsci 1975 , Q9§71, 1142 –1143). Given that bureaucracy originates for the most part from the bourgeoisie and itssubgroups, a solid bourgeois regime corresponds to a “healthy ”bureaucracy. Inversely, behind weak political rule there are malfunctioning bureaucraticapparatuses. The comparison of different countries is illuminating. Whereas inFrance the middle class is broad and strong (Gramsci 1975 , Q5§119, 638 –639), in Germany the bureaucracy is derived from the Junkers, who are defined as“mummificata e mutilata ”as a social class, although still self-conscious (Gramsci 1975 , Q14§47, 1705). In Italy, bureaucrats mostly arose from the impoverished and parasitical rural bourgeoisie, which has a “non-national ”and selfish character (Gramsci 1975 , Q3§46, 324 –325). 5 The theme of the class origins of the bureaucracy is relevant because of its connection with the issue of hegemony. Bureaucratic apparatuses are indeedessential in establishing and maintaining a regime, and they deal in “coercion ” as well as “consent. ”This also explains Gramsci ’s focus on the twofold nature of bureaucracy, which is both civil and military. 6This double characterization precociously emerges and capitalizes on the distinction between military andpolitical leadership, between the technical-military element and the military-political one (Gramsci 1975 , Q1§114, 101 –102; Q1§117, 110 –111). The latter is key for Gramsci ’s account of bureaucracy, since it plays a role in the hegemonic process. In order to evaluate this double nature, Gramsci considersnot only its “actual
hegemonic process. In order to evaluate this double nature, Gramsci considersnot only its “actual ”state, but also its “potentiality, ”i.e. the role of the “strati sociali da cui, in quel determinato complesso statale, questi elementitradizionalmente sono reclutati ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q4§66, 509). 3. Bureaucracy as Profession While developing these general historical and sociological remarks, Gramsci also focuses on the specific features of bureaucracy, which appears as a specialized and conservative force, detached from the popular masses. The theme of the“specialism ”of bureaucracy is crucial in the context of modernity: “Il fatto che nello svolgimento storico delle forme politiche ed economiche si sia venutoformando il tipo del funzionario ‘di carriera ’, tecnicamente addestrato al lavoro burocratico (civile e militare) ha un significato primordiale nella scienza politicae nella storia delle forme statali ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q13§36, 1632). 7Gramsci first investigates bureaucracy ’s“specialism ”in connection with the issue of education and its reform (Gramsci 1975 , Q4§50, 485 –488; Q6§179, 825 –826). Its political consequences, however, are far more relevant.18 F.ANTONINI
Like Gramsci ’s bitter criticisms of officers ’overspecialization (and of the “decadence ”of specialization),8his focus on the conservative attitude that derives from this professionalism is noteworthy. Given their lifelong assignments, state functionaries are naturally keen to maintain the status quo. Thus, bureaucrats historically back the ruling classes (Gramsci 1975 , Q2§29, 184 –186; see also Gramsci 1975 , Q1§116, 103 –110; Q6§162, 814 –816). However, this conservatism can degenerate. Far from being simply “traditional, ”the bureaucratic apparatuses embody the most backward tendencies or, as Gramsci says, “la forza consuetudenaria pi /C18u pericolosa ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q7§77, 910), which can impede the progressive development of the country (Gramsci 1975 , Q15§39, 1794 –1798; Q23§32, 2218 –2226). From this point of view, Gramsci ’s lexicon is self-explanatory, as when he talks about the “mummification ”and “fossilization ”of culture (see, for instance, Gramsci 1975 , Q1§133, 122).9 According to Gramsci, the conservatism of the bureaucracy follows from its detachment from the people. Discussing the lack of hegemony in post- Risorgimento Italy, Gramsci argues that “la burocrazia cos /C18ısi estraniava dal paese, e attraverso le posizioni amministrative, diventava un vero partito politico, il peggiore di tutti, perch /C19e la gerarchia burocratica sostituiva la gerarchia intellettuale e politica: la burocrazia diventava appunto il partito statale-bonapartistico ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q3§119, 387). This feature is emphasized in the following notes through an analogy with “caste. ”If Gramsci defines bureaucracy as the “cristallizzazione del personale dirigente che esercita il potere coercitivo e che a un certo punto diventa casta ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q6§81, 752), he also writes that “l’elemento burocratico, civile, ma specialmente militare, ha le maggiori tendenze allo spirito di corpo, che conduce alla formazione di ‘caste’”(Gramsci 1975 , Q8§81, 987). This last text further
corpo, che conduce alla formazione di ‘caste’”(Gramsci 1975 , Q8§81, 987). This last text further enriches Gramsci ’s imagery by adopting the category of “esprit de corps ”alongside that of caste, where the latter appears as a degeneration of the former. Moreover, these observations seem to anticipate his later investigations of “sectarianism ”and“fetishism ”(on these categories, see Antonini 2020 , 378–382). On a general level, Gramsci ’s analysis of the distance between the bureaucracy and the masses evokes a key theme in the Notebooks , that of the intellectuals and their separation from the people (Frosini 2011 ). This linkage is explicitly suggested in Q4§33 (452), where the terminology of “caste”/“priesthood ” occurs again and, then, in Q5§38 and Q5§120, on officers ’literary works (571, 639–640). However, the (dis-)connection between bureaucracy and the masses also returns implicitly in other notes, inasmuch as Gramsci enlarges the category of the “intellectual ”and turns cultural issues into political issues (see, for instance, Gramsci 1975 , Q9§21, 1109). 10 4. Bureaucracy and Political Parties Gramsci ’s reference to the intellectuals displays the political potential of the category of bureaucracy, which is also closely connected to the nature ofGRAMSCI ON BUREAUCRACY 19
modern political parties and to parliamentarism. The first theme is raised in Q2§75, where Gramsci, dwelling on Robert Michels ’s thought (influenced by Weber), discusses the “complessivit /C18a progressiva del mestiere politico, ”which requires “capi dei partiti ”to“diventare sempre pi /C18u professionisti ”and gain “pratica burocratica ”(236)11Here Gramsci is referring to the specialization of politicians, that is, to the technical competences required by contemporary politics, and, most significantly, to their increasing detachment from the popular masses. Gramsci follows the quoted passage with observations on the contradiction between “le dichiarazioni e le intenzioni democratiche e la realt /C18a oligarchica ”existing within advanced parties (see also the above-mentioned passage —Gramsci 1975 , Q7§77, 910 —where Gramsci describes the party leadership in negative terms as the “burocrazia o stato maggiore del partito ”). Bureaucracy, in the context of the party, therefore means its “degeneration, ” the betrayal of its democratic aims by the leadership. Gramsci uses the term “bureaucratic party ”first of all to characterize misleading tendencies within the workers ’movement. This emerges openly, for instance, in Q4§31 (447 –451). On the one hand, Gramsci criticizes Georges Sorel, who bluntly classifies Marxism either as “proudhoniano ”or as “ortodosso ”and, therefore, “burocratico ”(having in mind only the case of the German SPD). On the other, he calls Henri De Man “un esemplare pedantesco della burocrazia laborista belga. ”12Boris Souvarine ’s bureaucratic conception of historical materialism is also at stake elsewhere (Gramsci 1975 , Q7§43, 891 –892). Moreover, bureaucracy is linked to Gramsci ’s reassessment of the concept of “centralism. ”In debates at the time, this category describes the highly centralized organization of communist parties. In the Italian context, it was adopted especially by Amadeo Bordiga (leader of the Italian Communist Party between
context, it was adopted especially by Amadeo Bordiga (leader of the Italian Communist Party between 1921 and 1924) and, as such, harshly criticized in the Notebooks .13In fact, Gramsci rejects “centralismo organico ”/C18al aBordiga, stressing its sectarian, top-down features (Gramsci 1975 , Q3§56, 337; but see also Q4§31, 447 –451 and Q6§128, 796). This type of centralism is opposed to a positive, “centralismo democratico, ”as explained in Q9§68 (1138 –1140). In this text from Notebook 9, however, Gramsci changes his mind and reconsiders the category of organic centralism (although his refusal of Bordiga ’s policy is still retained). From this point onward, the “bad”version of centralism will be the “bureaucratic ”one, while the adjective “organic ”acquires a positive meaning (in the sense of “consistent, well organized ”). This characterization is emphasized in the following notes, and notably in his later political reflections (see Notebooks 14, 15, and 17). From this point of view, a pivotal text is Q14§34, where the opposition between organic “democratic centralism ”and “bureaucratic centralism ”is used to explain the political party ’s two antithetical ways of functioning. Thus, Gramsci states: “quando il partito /C18e progressivo esso funziona ‘democraticamente ’(nel senso di un centralismo democratico), quando il partito /C18e regressivo esso funziona ‘burocraticamente ’(nel senso di un centralismo burocratico) ”(1692).1420 F.ANTONINI
5. Bureaucracy and Parliamentarism In this way, Gramsci ’s references to bureaucracy in the context of his broader understanding of the representative principle —and of parliamentarism as an expression of this principle —are also clarified. The opposition between bureaucracy and parliamentarism dates back to an early stage of his analysis. As he stresses already in Q4§49, the legislative power has to keep the bureaucracy under control: if the latter takes over, the representative principle vanishes, anddemocracy disappears (474 –484). This can also be seen in Q6§79, where the absence of real democracy is the counterpart of the “dispotismo ”of bureaucracy (751), or in Q6§81, where bureaucracy is described as the source of the weakness of liberalism: “la fonte della debolezza del liberalismo …/C18el a burocrazia, cio /C18e la cristallizzazione del personale dirigente che esercita il potere coercitivo e che a un certo punto diventa casta ”(752). Further examples could also be mentioned. 15 If these reflections apply to several nineteenth-century countries, they describe even more aptly the situation in the 1930s and the “organic crisis ”or, as Gramsci also says, the “crisis of authority ”or“crisis of hegemony. ”16Gramsci thoroughly analyzes the political aspects of this “interregnum ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q3§34, 311–312). In the advanced phase of his work, showing a significant affinity with contemporary reflections, he focuses on the crisis of the representative principle, that is on the “dissoluzione del regime parlamentare, ”as he defines it (Gramsci 1975 , Q13§37, 1637).17The most explicit manifestations of this crisis are the multiplication of parties and their weakness, as well as growing difficulties in forming governments. Gramsci synthesizes this situation by noting the absence of an“indirizzo politico permanente ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q15§47, 1807). Consequently, parliamentary groups behave in a “bureaucratic ”way, detached from the masses and with a concern only for
groups behave in a “bureaucratic ”way, detached from the masses and with a concern only for their personal interests (see, on this point, Gramsci 1975 , Q15§48, 1809: “i partiti sono sostituiti da camarille e influssi personali non confessabili ”).18Bureaucracy is thus a metaphor for the crisis of politics that characterizes Gramsci ’s time. Gramsci summarizes this situation by affirming that “il parlamentarismo /C18e divenuto inefficiente e anzi dannoso, ”and that “/C18e da vedere se parlamentarismo e regime rappresentativo si identificano e se non sia possibile una diversa soluzione sia del parlamentarismo che del regime burocratico, con un nuovo tipo di regime rappresentativo ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q14§49, 1708). 6. Bureaucracy and Modernity In the light of this opposition between bureaucracy and the representative principle, the meaning of Gramsci ’s remarks about the “democratic-bureaucratic ” features of contemporary politics is also clear (see Gramsci 1975 , Q8§22, 953–954; Q12§1, 1513 –1540). The compound adjective “democratic- bureaucratic ”is used to describe the unique mix represented by twentieth-centuryGRAMSCI ON BUREAUCRACY 21
autocratic regimes, notably Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.19Whereas “democratic ”points to the involvement of popular masses in the political processes (through, for instance, propaganda and plebiscites), the term “bureaucratic, ”rather than simply describing the role of bureaucratic apparatuses within these systems, highlights the collapse of the principle of representation and the subsequent absence of hegemony —at least conceived of in the traditional sense. Hegemony, in the interwar period, indeed has a new meaning; Frosini fruitfully discusses a form of “‘post-Jacobin ’hegemony. ”20Alongside the mobilization of large groups of people, this implies their control by authorities that seek to “organize ”consensus —and consequently, the blurring of the distinction between the private and public spheres. It is not by chance that, already in Q6§138, Gramsci describes an “concentrazione inaudita dell’egemonia ”(802). These changes are summarized by his overall reading of this situation as a “totalitarian ”one.21 We can trace references to bureaucracy in different elements of Gramsci ’s analysis of this new political and ideological framework. Bureaucratic apparatuses are first mentioned during his investigation of Caesarism, which emerges from Q4§69 (513) and Q9§133 (1194 –1195).22In this latter note (later redrafted in Q13§27, 1619 –1622), Gramsci hints, in particular, at the “formarsi di vaste burocrazie statali e ‘private ’(politico-private, di partito e sindacali) ”(1195) These accompany Caesarist phenomena, enlarging the concept of bureaucracy.23Moreover, bureaucracy is also described as one of the “potenze oscure ”of Caesarism that attempt to overthrow liberal regimes (Gramsci 1975 , Q13§23, 1603). Gramsci analyzes a further aspect of bureaucracy in his discussion of so-called “statolatry. ”In Q3§61, this phenomenon is defined as a form of state worship, a confusion of the state itself with “burocrazia statale, ”which characterizes both initial phases of the
of the state itself with “burocrazia statale, ”which characterizes both initial phases of the state, but also, remarkably, its advanced and post- modern stages (340). Gramsci discusses “un determinato atteggiamento verso il ‘governo dei funzionari, ’”which implies the primacy of the state over civil society (Gramsci 1975 , Q8§130, 1020; see also Q8§142, 1028 –1029). In this context, the state functionaries, due to their innate conservatism and backwardness, are the symbol of the separation of the ruling class from the people and, thus, of the end of political representation. It has to be noted that this definition does not contradict Gramsci ’s enlargement of the category of bureaucracy described above (and, consequently, also of the state).24Rather, Gramsci connects the new political situation closely with the bureaucracy, by demonstrating also its complex nature. This“dispotismo …della burocrazia ”(Gramsci 1975 , Q6§79, 751) relies on the“passivit /C18a”of the popular masses (Gramsci 1975 , Q8§108, 1004), in an economic and, more significantly, a political sense. This issue also evokes Gramsci ’s broader reflections on the “apoliticism ”and“subversivism ”of the Italian people,25insofar as these phenomena result in a passive attitude toward these institutions. From this perspective, passivity is conceived both as a natural22 F.ANTONINI
feature of the Italian “type,”and also a consequence of the lack of hegemony that characterized Italy ’s history.26The theme of the passivity of the masses even more clearly recalls the category of “passive revolution, ”which represents the most advanced political conceptualization in Gramsci ’s prison writings. Elsewhere, however, Gramsci stresses that a response to this situation can be found in a complete reshaping of the political scenario, beginning with arefoundation of the political party and capitalizing on a new conception of discipline and personal initiative. 27In this framework, a “good”version of bureaucracy (which enhances true political representation) might be possible, too, as Gramsci seems to hypothesize in Q14§49 (1707 –1708). 7. Gramsci and Weber To conclude, I would like to compare (albeit very briefly) Gramsci ’s conceptualization with Weber ’s theory of bureaucracy, which is by far the most famous within political science. Such a confrontation with Weber ’s theory is necessary in any analysis of the theme and is particularly necessary in this framework.28Their accounts display both similarities and differences. In fact, Gramsci and Weber share a criticism of late nineteenth- and early twentieth- century liberal systems and a diagnosis of the contemporary crisis of politics. However, their investigations unfold along different lines, even if there is an interesting overlapping in their understanding of some themes, such as, for example, the professional character of the bureaucracy. On the one hand,Weber ’s rigorous sociological analysis focuses on transformations within the state organization and the degeneration of the democratic-representative principle. On the other hand, Gramsci writes in a less systematic way, given well-known carceral restrictions, with different aspects of the issue of bureaucracy, deepening in particular his reflections on its relationship withhegemony —on different levels; consider, for instance, his understanding of
on its relationship withhegemony —on different levels; consider, for instance, his understanding of centralism or the democratic-bureaucratic nature of modernity. The distance between the two authors is clarified when we examine their “solutions ”to this critical situation. From this point of view, they even appear antithetical. Weber ’s“dilemma ”—that is, the antithesis between democratic legitimacy and political effectiveness —is, as is well known, unsolvable; the only means of escape is through charismatic leadership, which, however, opens up a completely new political panorama. While Gramsci thoroughly investigates dictatorial scenarios, in history and in theory, he puts forward a revolutionary solution. This is embodied mainly in his proposal for the “modern prince, ”but it also finds stimulating developments in other strands of his thought, as this essay has outlined. Gramsci ’s account of bureaucracy is original and multi-layered, representing a valuable contribution to research on this issue. Finally, in the context of the Prison Notebooks in general, the concept of bureaucracy allows for the development of Gramsci ’s political thought from the early notebooks to his finalGRAMSCI ON BUREAUCRACY 23
notes. In its non-linearity and complexity, his analysis of bureaucratic apparatuses is a perfect example of what Buttigieg called “Gramsci ’s method. ” Notes 1 This reading draws on the most recent philological achievements of the scholarship,notably the new Italian critical edition of Gramsci ’s works, the Edizione nazionale degli scritti di Antonio Gramsci , which is currently being published. 2 In this regard, see Francioni ( 2009 ). 3 Useful though not exhaustive analyses of Gramsci ’s conception of bureaucracy can be found in Portantiero ( 1981 ,9–65), Filippini (entry in Liguori and Voza 2009 ,9 0–91), Filippini (2015 , 213ff), and Burgio ( 2007 ,2 5 9 ) . 4 Gramsci also depicts “Eastern ”countries, such as China and Japan, as deeply bureaucratic. On the Chinese “struttura burocratico-militare dello stato, ”see Gramsci 1975 , Q5§23, 558-559. On Japan, see Gramsci 1975 , Q5§50, 579-582; Q8§87, 992 and Q12§1, 1529. See also his comparison between the Chinese bureaucracy of the mandarins, the Italian bureaucratic apparatuses during the Risorgimento, and the bureaucracy of the Catholic Church (with the Papacy conceived of as the hidebound institution par excellence ) drawn in Gramsci 1975 , Q14§47, 1705. On the combination of feudalism and bureaucracy, see also Gramsci 1975 ,Q 8 § 4 0 : “vecchia Russia feudale e burocratica. ” 5 These observations partially recall Gramsci ’s pre-prison text on the Southern Question, butalso echo Marx ’sLumpenproletariat ; on these “sources, ”see Antonini ( 2021 ). 6 The expression “civil and military bureaucracy ” recurs frequently in the Notebooks ,s e e ,f o r instance, Gramsci 1975 , Q9§89, 1156. See also Q17§53, where he refers to the “impalcatura burocratico-militare ”of the Roman Empire (1949). 7 This note rewrites Q9§21, by expanding significantly on the content of the first draft text, especially regarding the characterization of bureaucracy. 8 Cf. Gramsci 1975 , Q1§122, 113, where he writes that “chi /C18e troppo
of bureaucracy. 8 Cf. Gramsci 1975 , Q1§122, 113, where he writes that “chi /C18e troppo minuzioso per professione, si burocratizza: vede l ’albero e non pi/C18u la foresta, il regolamento e non pi /C18ul a strategia. ”See also Q1§101, 95, where, while talking about the institutionalization andimpoverishment of the music festival of Piedigrotta and the transformations of their organizers into “officers, ”he evokes the French tale of the bouc fonctionnaire (on this, see Gramsci 2017, 237, fn. 457).9 On mummification and other related categories, see Jackson ( 2016 ) and Jackson ( 2019 ). Not by chance, “bureaucratize ”is used as a synonym of “fossilize ”; see Gramsci 1975 , Q6§84, 757. 10 On this pivotal point, see, among others, Thomas (2009). 11 On Michels and Weber, see Mommsen ( 1981 ). On Gramsci and Michels, see Basile ( 2016 ) and Bianchi ( 2019 ). Among Weber ’s works, Gramsci read Parliament and Government in Germany under a new Political Order (1918) and The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism , (the latter was published between 1931 and 1932 in the journal Nuovi studi di diritto, economia e politica ). Filippini ( 2015 , 214-215) argues that Gramsci ’s readings also included other Weberian texts, but his hypothesis is not very compelling. It is more likely that Gramsci knew Weber ’s thought indirectly through Michels ’writings. 12 On Gramsci and Sorel, see, for instance, Cavallari ( 2011 ). On Gramsci and De Man, see Mastellone ( 2001 ). 13 On this theme, see Cospito ( 2016 , 169ff). 14 On this note and, more generally, on the final miscellaneous notebooks, see Antonini ( 2019 ). 15 See Gramsci 1975 , Q6§40, where it is said that the English regime is not a representative one, since its parliament is not able to regulate the role of bureaucracy (714-715); Gramsci 1975 , Q6§86, where “l’abito diplomatico ”is described, with additions made later by Gramsci, “una professione subalterna, [subordinata, esecutivo- burocratica] ”(762); Gramsci 1975 ,Q
Gramsci, “una professione subalterna, [subordinata, esecutivo- burocratica] ”(762); Gramsci 1975 ,Q 8 § 5 2 :t h e “burocrazia [ …] deve essere controllata e guidata dalla classe politica ”(972). 16 On this theme, see Martin ( 2002 , 258), Burgio (2014 , 161ff) and Antonini ( 2016 ). 17 This expression (Gramsci does not adopt the expression “crisis of parliamentarism ”)i sa l r e a d y used in the first draft of this note (Gramsci 1975 , Q1§48, 60). In the context of the first half of the 1930s (Q13§37 is dated May 1932- November 1933), however, it assumes a deeper meaning. On the “crisis of parliamentarism ”in Gramsci, see Vacca ( 2017 , chap. 4) and Frosini (2017 ). This theme was widespread in public debates: in early 1933, e.g., the crisis of parliamentarism was a hot topic in Fascistjournals (although mostly with reference to German politics). As to the Notebooks ,G r a m s c i24 F.ANTONINI
deals with parliamentarism and its crisis especially in Notebook 14 and 15. 18 A further element of the transformation of parliamentarism in the twentieth-century contextis expressed by “black parliamentarism ”(an unofficial form of representation of the varietyof interests that continue to exist withintotalitarian contexts). On this theme, seeFrancioni ( 2020 )a n dA n t o n i n i( 2021 ). 19 There are also more or less implicit references to Soviet Russia —on Gramsci ’s“alternative modernities, ”see Vacca (2017). 20 See Frosini ( 2016a ). 21 On these transformations, see Antonini ( 2019 ). 22 See Gramsci 1975 , Q4§69: “questa situazione di contrasto tra rappresentati e rappresentanti,che dal terreno delle organizzazioni private(partiti o sindacati) non pu /C18o non riflettersinello Stato, rafforzando in modo formidabile il potere della burocrazia ”(513; then redrafted in Q13§23, 1602-1613). 23 Gramsci does the same with the “police ”—on this point, see Gramsci 1975 , Q13§27, 1619- 1622; Q14§34, 1691-1692; Q2§150, 278-279. 24 On this theme, see Buci-Glucksmann ( 1980 ) and Liguori ( 2015 ). 25 See Frosini ( 2016b ). 26 On these themes and their connection with bureaucracy, see also Gramsci 1975 , Q6§166, 818-819; Q8§142, 1028-1029. 27 See Antonini ( 2019 ). 28 Such a comparison is developed in Filippini (2015 ), on whose work I draw in part here. The bibliography on Weber is extensive. An interesting “Gramscian ”approach can be found in Rehmann ( 2014 ).

El artículo "Gramsci on Bureaucracy" de Francesca Antonini, publicado en la revista *Italian Culture*, examina las ideas de Antonio Gramsci sobre la burocracia, un tema que se encuentra en el centro de su análisis político y social. La publicación, que forma parte del volumen 40, número 1 de la revista, abarca las páginas 16 a 26 y fue publicada en línea el 8 de junio de 2022. Antonini utiliza un enfoque filológico, siguiendo la metodología de Joseph Buttigieg, para interpretar los "Cuadernos de la cárcel" de Gramsci, donde se despliega su conceptualización de la burocracia.

El artículo destaca cómo Gramsci ve la burocracia como un elemento crucial en la estructura del poder y la administración de la sociedad, analizando sus implicaciones en la vida política y social, así como su relación con la hegemonía cultural y el control social. Gramsci critica la burocracia por su potencial para deshumanizar y alienar a los individuos, lo que se relaciona con su visión más amplia de la lucha política y la transformación social. La autora también establece una comparación entre las teorías de Gramsci y Max Weber, identificando similitudes y diferencias en sus enfoques sobre la burocracia y el poder.

El ensayo se organiza en varias secciones. La primera investiga la burocracia como parte de las instituciones estatales, mientras que las siguientes se centran en las características de los aparatos burocráticos, su relación con los partidos políticos y el sistema parlamentario, y la concepción de modernidad de Gramsci. La conclusión presenta una comparación entre las teorías de Gramsci y Weber, resaltando cómo ambos pensadores abordan la burocracia en el contexto de sus respectivas visiones del poder.

Gramsci describe la burocracia como un cuerpo administrativo que, en el caso de Francia, se presenta como una fuente de estabilidad frente a intentos de derrocar el sistema político. Contrasta la centralización de la burocracia francesa con la fragmentación de la burocracia italiana, lo que refleja las diferentes trayectorias políticas de ambos países. Además, Gramsci argumenta que la burocracia tiene su origen en la burguesía y que un régimen burgués sólido se corresponde con una burocracia "saludable".

El texto también aborda la naturaleza dual de la burocracia, que opera tanto en el ámbito civil como militar, y su papel en el proceso hegemónico. Gramsci critica la especialización excesiva de los funcionarios estatales, sugiriendo que esta desconexión con las masas contribuye a un conservadurismo que obstaculiza el progreso social. La burocracia se convierte en un "partido estatal-bonapartistico", alienándose del pueblo y cristalizándose en una casta.

El análisis de Gramsci se extiende a la relación entre la burocracia y el parlamentarismo, donde critica la burocratización de los partidos políticos y su desconexión de las bases populares. Propone la necesidad de un "centralismo democrático" en contraposición al "centralismo orgánico" defendido por Bordiga, sugiriendo que un partido es progresivo cuando opera de manera democrática.

El artículo también explora la crisis del parlamentarismo y la relación entre la burocracia y los regímenes autocráticos, como el fascismo en Italia y el nazismo en Alemania. Gramsci argumenta que la burocracia es una de las principales fuentes de debilidad del liberalismo y que su control puede llevar a un despotismo burocrático.

Finalmente, el texto destaca la originalidad del análisis de Gramsci sobre la burocracia y su relevancia en el contexto político contemporáneo, sugiriendo que su obra ofrece un recurso fundamental para entender las crisis políticas y sociales, así como las formas de resistencia y organización en la lucha por la transformación social. La obra de Francesca Antonini se presenta como una contribución significativa a la discusión sobre la interpretación del legado intelectual de Gramsci, especialmente en lo que respecta a la burocracia y su papel en la política moderna.
