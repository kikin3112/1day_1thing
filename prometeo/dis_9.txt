MANAGEMENT  Karen K. Mortland, M Arch, MT(ASCP)  John H. Reddick  Laboratory Design for Today's  Technologies and Marketplace  ABSTRACT Many  laboratories  must  be redesigned  to  adapt  to rapid changes  in equipment  technology  and in the  business  of health  care.  The information  needed  to select  design goals can be gathered  by following  a three-step  discovery  process.  Architectural  and engineering plans may  then be developed.  The  proposed design  must  address  build­ ing and safety  codes,  the incorporation  and anticipation  of  new technologies,  productivity  concerns,  and marketing  strategies.  After  existing conditions are defined  and a  design  is developed,  a detailed cost analysis can be  performed.  A  phasing plan that  spreads construction  and costs over several  years  may  be considered.  Due to the  complexity  of a major  laboratory  redesign,  an architectural  and engineering  firm  with extensive laboratory design experience should be  a key  member of the  project design  team from  the start.

In many cases, laboratories must be redesigned to adapt to these changes.  The incorporation of new technology can sub­ stantially alter demands placed on the laboratory  working environment. With its increased reliabil­ity and sophistication, new equipment requires less monitoring by technologists, who are then free to work on more unusual and demanding  tasks.

must be redesigned to  provide technologists with a space to practice  labor-intensive skills yet remain close enough to the "self-sufficient" automated systems to keep a watchful eye. While it is apparent that new labo­ ratory equipment can require physical alterations  to accommodate its size and design, mechanical  changes (eg, power supply, plumbing, ventila­ tion) that may accompany the new technologies  may be less apparent. Changes on the business side of health care  require administrators to market services as well  as to monitor costs. The laboratory, once per­ ceived as a department to be hidden in the base­ ment of a medical complex, is now given a more  visible role as outpatient services continue to  increase. Today, a well-designed laboratory that  provides a feeling of confidence, comfort, and convenience is viewed as a tool to recruit  physicians and managed care organizations to a  facility. Finally, efficiency and productivity in the laboratory have become paramount as adminis­trators struggle to meet budgets strained by  increased competition.  Discover Your Laboratory Design Goals  Laboratory design must begin with information  gathering. By following a simple three-step  discovery process, you may collect the individual  pieces of the design "puzzle." Accurate documen­tation and analysis of this information will  provide a current picture of your laboratory and  suggest future design goals.  1. Take a detailed inventory of all equipment  including size and weight, and electrical, plumb­ ing, and ventilation requirements. Include cut  sheets (catalog information) on new as well as  existing equipment you wish to include in the lab­ oratory design. Maintain a notebook with equip­ ment manufacturers' information to save time  when you decide to redesign your laboratory.  2.

You must  determine the capacity and condition of heating,  ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units,  and plumbing, electrical, and communications equipment. The location of this equipment and  accompanying chases that contain wiring, plumb­ ing, ductwork, and so on should be noted. An accurate record of this information is critical  when new designs are considered.  Evaluate Architectural and  Engineering Requirements  In the quest for a laboratory that incorporates the  goals established in the discovery process, two  distinct design areas must be addressed.  Architectural requirements include, in addition  to equipment and appearance concerns, the  interaction of people with the laboratory envi­ ronment. Engineering requirements include  mechanical, electrical, and plumbing. The success of the finished product depends on the successful  fusion of these two design areas.  Of major concern to architects and engineers  involved in designing a laboratory are the myriad  building and safety codes the final design must  satisfy. The completed laboratory must comply  with federal, state, municipal, and industry  codes.  Discerning the narrow pathway of compli­ ance among these often contradictory life safety, health care, and building codes requires experi­ ence and team coordination.  A good architectural plan should promote  worker productivity as well as safety. Although  operational methods used by individual  laboratories will dictate different arrangements  to achieve maximum efficiency, most will benefit  by centrally locating major analyzers.  Workstations may be situated around this core. This arrangement allows less flexible areas, such  as sinks and pneumatic tube stations, to be  located around the
allows less flexible areas, such  as sinks and pneumatic tube stations, to be  located around the laboratory perimeter. Such a basic floor plan will promote employee efficiency yet flexibly adapt to the incorporation of new  technologies.  As the architectural plan is developed, the  space requirements of new technologic systems  must be incorporated carefully. If a robotics sys­ tem is being considered, a more open space that permits straight-line conveyers is preferred because each turn in a conveyor system can sub­ stantially increase overall costs. Ergonomic consid­ erations, integrating the relationship between  worker and workplace, also must be given to tech­ nologists working with such new technologic sys­ tems as robotics. Workers must be protected from injuries while working in areas with robotic  equipment, trips or falls due to exposed wiring  and plumbing, hearing damage caused by a large  amount of automated equipment in a limited space, and fatigue from standing for long periods  of  time.  Patient and worker accessibility issues also will  affect the ultimate design. The mandates of the  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) can affect  the design of the laboratory and waiting room Fig 2. Awaiting area  should be designed  to make the patient  comfortable and  reflect positively on  the laboratory. o  0  o  MAY 1997 VOLUME 28, NUMBER 5 LABORATORY MEDICINE 333 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/labmed/article-abstract/28/5/332/2503815 by guest on 28 May 2018Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/labmed/article/28/5/332/2503815 by guest on 27 July 2024

In a good architectural design, added space  that is required by the ADA also can be used to  facilitate the movement of carts and equipment.  Architectural design must reflect the laborato­ ry's new visibility. In addition to providing an  atmosphere conducive to internal productivity  and safety, the laboratory must appear attractive  to patients and health care providers. With today's emphasis on outpatient services, the visi­ bility and presentation of ancillary services,  including laboratories, are major factors in hos­ pital renovations across the country. Thus the impression that waiting rooms and phlebotomy  areas have on patients is more important than  ever (Fig 2). In today's competitive health care  market, the designer's goal is to create a laboratory that projects a professional, cutting- edge image and that creates an attractive and  comfortable atmosphere for patients.  As the architectural plan for the laboratory  begins to evolve, the second design area, engi­ neering, must be developed simultaneously. The  function of the finished laboratory will depend  greatly on "invisible" engineering systems that  provide power for machines, ventilation for com­ fort, and gases and water for laboratory proce­ dures.  These hidden systems will, in most cases,  account for nearly 40% of the construction bud­get (Fig 3).  The principal mechanical engineering concern  encountered in the redesign of most laboratories  is the HVAC system. The incorporation of new, automated equipment into the laboratory envi­ ronment can add substantially to the heat load. In addition to heating elements incorporated in  some test equipment, internal motors, refrigera­ tion equipment, and circuit board cooling fans increase the ambient air temperature of the labo­ ratory. Air
and circuit board cooling fans increase the ambient air temperature of the labo­ ratory. Air conditioning and ventilation systems  must be designed to handle this increase.  Research indicates that laboratory personnel  encounter increasing numbers of carcinogens and environmental hazards in chemicals and  biologic aerosols every day. Mechanical codes,  therefore, demand stricter parameters for HVAC  systems. Protecting your staff and patients can  require specialized pressurization, directional air  flow, and filtration.  Different areas of the laboratory may require  different HVAC solutions to protect technologists  and to reduce contamination from procedures. Biosafety Level 3 conditions, for example, such as  those encountered in mycobacteriology laborato­ ries using DNA amplification, have specific  HVAC requirements. Ante rooms, similar to  those found in patient isolation rooms,  directional air flow, negative pressurization, fil­ tration of exhaust, and total exhaust to the out­side are required. Other laboratory procedures  require clean room conditions, where the amount  of airborne contaminants (lint and bacteria) is critical. Pharmacies already require fully enclosed  clean rooms for certain procedures, and similar  requirements are likely to be adopted for parts of the laboratory. The HVAC design must address  these and similar concerns.  The electrical system provides power for  equipment and lighting. Incorporating new tech­ nologies into the laboratory may substantially  increase power requirements. Allowing some  extra capacity in power supply and using easily  accessed cable trays that contain all wiring will  afford some flexibility in the future as equipment  is added or moved. The emergency power system must be designed to provide emergency lighting  and a reliable backup for those systems critical to  laboratory operation, particularly incubators and  refrigeration units.  The electrical engineering plan also includes  communication systems
and  refrigeration units.  The electrical engineering plan also includes  communication systems and lighting design.  Sufficient telephone and data lines must be provided for communication and computer  networks. Consider whether additional  staff,  computers, or both, will create a demand for  additional telephone lines. When drafting the  lighting portion of the electrical plan, you should  consider light levels, glare, alignment to worksta­ tions,  ceiling heights, shadows, and flexibility.  The laboratory plumbing system may include  tap water, deionized water, drains, medical gases,  emergency wash equipment, and the sprinkler system. While laboratory procedures and equip­ ment requirements may make this part of the  LABORATORY MEDICINE VOLUME 28, NUMBER 5 MAY 1997 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/labmed/article-abstract/28/5/332/2503815 by guest on 28 May 2018Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/labmed/article/28/5/332/2503815 by guest on 27 July 2024
design seem simple, plumbing codes can unex­ pectedly and greatly affect this part of the design. Environmental codes will dictate the types of plumbing materials a particular laboratory must use depending on the types of waste that labora­tory produces. Safety codes strictly regulate the  function and locations of emergency eyewashes  and showers. Water flow, operation time, and the ability to hold both eyes open while flushing are code-regulated factors that can affect the selec­tion of an emergency eyewash. Because codes also dictate that eyewash facilities be tested weekly, it is desirable that the water this unit produces be contained in a sink.  Cost Analysis  After existing conditions are defined and solu­ tions suggested, calculate the cost of those solu­ tions.  The actual cost of  a project depends on the  scope of the work, geographic location, current  business environment, and schedule. Databases  compiled from historical information are avail­able for cost estimation. Initially, the project bud­get can be approximated by using a square-foot cost. As cost variables are defined more clearly, a detailed and accurate estimate can be developed.  If a major redesign proves too costly, consider  a phasing plan. By dividing equipment purchases and actual construction into well-planned, affordable stages, the final design may be com­pleted as the cost is spread over several fiscal  years.  Staff members also will gain additional  time to adjust to changes in their work environ­ ment. On the negative side, inflation will adversely affect the final cost of a phased project, and the full benefits of the laboratory redesign  will be delayed until all stages are completed.  Benefits of Hiring an Architectural/  Engineering Consultant  The design process may seem complicated, over­ whelming, and beyond a laboratory supervisor's time constraints and expertise. Solutions that  might seem simple at first become untenable after all details are considered. From
Solutions that  might seem simple at first become untenable after all details are considered. From information  gathering to defining problems to interpreting construction codes to suggesting practical solutions and estimating their cost, a reputable  architectural and engineering firm with extensive  laboratory design experience should be a key  member of the project design team from the start. Such a firm can be invaluable in helping yesterday's laboratory adapt to today's technolo­gies and marketplace. Make Your Design Project a Success  Although the world of advanced technology is ever changing, you can  take steps during planning to ensure that the design of your laboratory  meets its objectives.  The Plan  Establish clear priorities from the start. Channel all instructions to  the architectural project team through a single person. Consider your  future needs. If you anticipate that you will need additional space or  utilities, consider what steps might be taken today to accommodate  those needs of tomorrow.  The Design  The design process guides the project's function, quality, and bud­ get. The quality of  a project is established during the design phase;  it is merely realized during the construction phase. Money is com­mitted during the design phase; it is merely counted during the construction phase.  Following the Process  The traditional design process consists of  a programming phase, a  schematic phase, a design development phase, and a construction document phase. This approach has one major advantage over other methods—it works. People often are tempted to skip a step or to combine steps, often in the name of budget or schedule. Avoid taking such shortcuts. Each step of the design sequence has a purpose.  Active Participation  The design of  a laboratory requires significant participation by  process engineers, medical  staff,  and facilities engineers who must  communicate project requirements to the design team. Allow the design team the freedom
who must  communicate project requirements to the design team. Allow the design team the freedom to complete the design. Don't impede the process by becoming too involved in the details.  Involving the Builder Early  As the design progresses, concepts become fixed, making it difficult  to influence schedule, costs, and quality. The builder can provide a project schedule that will incorporate design activities with construc­tion activities to minimize the project's duration. He or she can also help manage the project budget by providing cost estimates at the  completion of each design phase.  Construction  The construction of  a laboratory lives or dies by how well quality,  cost, and schedule are managed.  Schedule  Efficient construction requires extensive planning to achieve project  goals.  Communicate to the builder the construction milestones that  must be met. The builder will direct the project toward these goals. Goals must be realistic and consistent.  Cost  The construction of  a laboratory is expensive. Communicate your  budget to your designer and builder. Give responsibility for budget  control to an individual or small group. Then give the individual or  group the authority to ensure that the budget is maintained.

Ante rooms, similar to  those found in patient isolation rooms,  directional air flow, negative pressurization, fil­ tration of exhaust, and total exhaust to the out­side are required. Other laboratory procedures  require clean room conditions, where the amount  of airborne contaminants (lint and bacteria) is critical. Pharmacies already require fully enclosed  clean rooms for certain procedures, and similar  requirements are likely to be adopted for parts of the laboratory. The HVAC design must address  these and similar concerns.  The electrical system provides power for  equipment and lighting. Incorporating new tech­ nologies into the laboratory may substantially  increase power requirements. Allowing some  extra capacity in power supply and using easily  accessed cable trays that contain all wiring will  afford some flexibility in the future as equipment  is added or moved. The emergency power system must be designed to provide emergency lighting  and a reliable backup for those systems critical to  laboratory operation, particularly incubators and  refrigeration units.  The electrical engineering plan also includes  communication systems
and  refrigeration units.  The electrical engineering plan also includes  communication systems and lighting design.  Sufficient telephone and data lines must be provided for communication and computer  networks. Consider whether additional  staff,  computers, or both, will create a demand for  additional telephone lines. When drafting the  lighting portion of the electrical plan, you should  consider light levels, glare, alignment to worksta­ tions,  ceiling heights, shadows, and flexibility.  The laboratory plumbing system may include  tap water, deionized water, drains, medical gases,  emergency wash equipment, and the sprinkler system.

design seem simple, plumbing codes can unex­ pectedly and greatly affect this part of the design. Environmental codes will dictate the types of plumbing materials a particular laboratory must use depending on the types of waste that labora­tory produces. Safety codes strictly regulate the  function and locations of emergency eyewashes  and showers. Water flow, operation time, and the ability to hold both eyes open while flushing are code-regulated factors that can affect the selec­tion of an emergency eyewash. Because codes also dictate that eyewash facilities be tested weekly, it is desirable that the water this unit produces be contained in a sink.  Cost Analysis  After existing conditions are defined and solu­ tions suggested, calculate the cost of those solu­ tions.  The actual cost of  a project depends on the  scope of the work, geographic location, current  business environment, and schedule. Databases  compiled from historical information are avail­able for cost estimation. Initially, the project bud­get can be approximated by using a square-foot cost. As cost variables are defined more clearly, a detailed and accurate estimate can be developed.  If a major redesign proves too costly, consider  a phasing plan. By dividing equipment purchases and actual construction into well-planned, affordable stages, the final design may be com­pleted as the cost is spread over several fiscal  years.  Staff members also will gain additional  time to adjust to changes in their work environ­ ment. On the negative side, inflation will adversely affect the final cost of a phased project, and the full benefits of the laboratory redesign  will be delayed until all stages are completed.  Benefits of Hiring an Architectural/  Engineering Consultant  The design process may seem complicated, over­ whelming, and beyond a laboratory supervisor's time constraints and expertise. Solutions that  might seem simple at first become untenable after all details are considered. From --- Solutions that  might seem simple at first become untenable after all details are considered. From information  gathering to defining problems to interpreting construction codes to suggesting practical solutions and estimating their cost, a reputable  architectural and engineering firm with extensive  laboratory design experience should be a key  member of the project design team from the start. Such a firm can be invaluable in helping yesterday's laboratory adapt to today's technolo­gies and marketplace. Make Your Design Project a Success  Although the world of advanced technology is ever changing, you can  take steps during planning to ensure that the design of your laboratory  meets its objectives.  The Plan  Establish clear priorities from the start. Channel all instructions to  the architectural project team through a single person. Consider your  future needs. If you anticipate that you will need additional space or  utilities, consider what steps might be taken today to accommodate  those needs of tomorrow.  The Design  The design process guides the project's function, quality, and bud­ get. The quality of  a project is established during the design phase;  it is merely realized during the construction phase. Money is com­mitted during the design phase; it is merely counted during the construction phase.  Following the Process  The traditional design process consists of  a programming phase, a  schematic phase, a design development phase, and a construction document phase. This approach has one major advantage over other methods—it works. People often are tempted to skip a step or to combine steps, often in the name of budget or schedule. Avoid taking such shortcuts. Each step of the design sequence has a purpose.  Active Participation  The design of  a laboratory requires significant participation by  process engineers, medical  staff,  and facilities engineers who must  communicate project requirements to the design team. Allow the design team the freedom
who must  communicate project requirements to the design team. Allow the design team the freedom to complete the design. Don't impede the process by becoming too involved in the details.  Involving the Builder Early  As the design progresses, concepts become fixed, making it difficult  to influence schedule, costs, and quality. The builder can provide a project schedule that will incorporate design activities with construc­tion activities to minimize the project's duration. He or she can also help manage the project budget by providing cost estimates at the  completion of each design phase.  Construction  The construction of  a laboratory lives or dies by how well quality,  cost, and schedule are managed.  Schedule  Efficient construction requires extensive planning to achieve project  goals.  Communicate to the builder the construction milestones that  must be met. The builder will direct the project toward these goals. Goals must be realistic and consistent.  Cost  The construction of  a laboratory is expensive. Communicate your  budget to your designer and builder. Give responsibility for budget  control to an individual or small group. Then give the individual or  group the authority to ensure that the budget is maintained.
