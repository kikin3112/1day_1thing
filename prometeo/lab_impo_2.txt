system of the industry- specific research and education complex is regarded  as a mechanism for implementation of this  model. Its structure and tools developed by the tea m of the Transport Information  Technologies research laboratory in the Siberian Tr ansport University (Novosibirsk) are  described.  1. Introduction  Digitalization of knowledge directly affects indust ry-specific universities and colleges, which are  naturally involved in the life cycle of forming the  knowledge of corporations in the industry. This  makes it possible to define an industry-specific un iversity or college as the main building block of t he  industry-specific research and education complex (R EC) and to define the complex itself as a special  form of integration of production, science, and edu cation that interact during the exchange of  knowledge flows, their interconnection and synchron ization in an integrated life cycle of knowledge.  This necessitates the creation of a system for mana ging such cycle. A knowledge management center  is regarded as a management body of the industry-sp ecific REC; its principal function is to use the  potential of its participants and interested partne rs (administration, business community, etc.) for t he  purpose of mutually beneficial exchange of knowledg e for comprehensive solution of educational,  research, social, and production tasks. At the stag e of the world community’s transition to the  knowledge economy and formation of a paradigm of di gital economy, knowledge management  becomes a crucial activity for corporations that ap ply modern methods of artificial intelligence to  retrieve knowledge from “big data”, and that use kn owledge engineering methods to formalize expert

Analysis of “knowledge management” definitions, the  results of which are set forth in  [Volegzhanina et al., 2017], makes it possible to t alk of three levels of semantic meaning of this  concept. At the first level—innovations and strateg y—this is an innovative strategy of development  which, if implemented, transforms all types of the industry’s intellectual assets (library collection,   databases, patents, licenses, standards and other r egulatory documents, descriptions of technologies,  project documentation, software, R&D results, progr ams of proficiency enhancement and professional  development of personnel, experts’ knowledge, etc.)  into better performance and efficiency, creates  new value, and ensures increased competitiveness on  national and international sector markets.  At the second level—functionality and activities—th is is a systematic activity of a labor subject  (worker, engineer, manager), the content of which i s determined by successive stages of the  knowledge life cycle that affects the nature of the  life cycle of his/her professional competence.  At the third level—instruments and technologies—thi s is a technology that ensures interaction  between natural and artificial intellectual agents in a hybrid corporate environment and implies  formalization of industrial regulations into an ont ological form (knowledge base) and mechanism of  management through knowledge-based inference (logic al inference). Here, knowledge becomes the  basic element of Industry 4.0 that seeps into all a reas of human activities,
becomes the  basic element of Industry 4.0 that seeps into all a reas of human activities, including production and  education.  One of the most important reasons for turning to th e concept of knowledge management is to  ensure preservation and development of the industry ’s intellectual potential. In this context, renewal  of  the life cycle of professional competence of the in dustry’s personnel becomes particularly relevant.  When life cycles of a person, his/her professional competence, and industry-specific knowledge are  considered with reference to each other, this offer s great opportunities for systematic management of  the life cycle of professional competence of the in dustry’s workers. For example, it is possible to  initiate new stages of the life cycle of this compe tence in a system of continuous professional traini ng  (extended learning, proficiency enhancement, profes sional development) in order to prevent a worker  from leaving the industry. To that effect, it is su ggested to identify the following set of components   within the industry-specific knowledge: fundamental , general professional, highly-specialized, and  corporate knowledge. The identified components of t he industry-specific knowledge vary in the length  of their life cycles, and this allows arranging ind ividual educational paths for each worker of the  industry, with account for his/her professional and  personal needs.  The foregoing unveils opportunities for knowledge m anagement aimed at overcoming the gap  between the real production sector, achievements of  the applied science, and professional education, a s  well as outlines the benchmarks for the development  of a mechanism of their integration within the  industry-specific REC.  2. Current status of the problem  The modern science regards “knowledge management” a s an interdisciplinary category. Its formation  stages are described in the study [Sağsan et al., 2 016].

described in the study [Sağsan et al., 2 016]. The first stage (1948–1994) is characterized by  the use of this term in such domains as artificial intelligence and cybernetics. The second stage (199 5– 2001) is associated with addressing the problems of  knowledge management at organizations and  emergence of such concepts as “intellectual capital ”, “on-the-job training”, “knowledge management  process”, etc. The third stage (2001–2004) deals wi th criticism and rethinking of the content of this  concept. The fourth stage (from 2005 to the present  day) marks the introduction of knowledge  management into the education sector. New studies a ppear where knowledge management is presented  as a comprehensive set of measures aimed at preserv ation of a corporation employee’s life cycle  [Antonova et al., 2006]. In the article of [Dante e t al., 2015], knowledge management is associated  with a number of milestone events that served as a catalyst for more active studying of professional  competence of a “labor subject”, namely: emergence of key technologies of the digital economy (in

Integration of participants of the industry-specifi c REC on the basis of knowledge management  requires a mechanism that is adequate in the contex t of digital transformations of production and  education. The knowledge management system (KMS) ca n be considered as such mechanism. KMS  are currently used in virtually all significant sec tors of the global economy. In Russia, they are  implemented at such industry-leading corporations a s Gazprom, Tatneft, Rosatom, RZD. Interest to  KMS development is also observed in pedagogy. Analy sis of scientific literature, the results of which  are provided in [Khabarov, Volegzhanina, 2018], has  shown that over the last ten years, the number of  studies dealing with the development of KMS in the education sector has considerably increased  [Gasmi, Bouras, 2018; Hornos et al, 2012; Khater et  al., 2015, etc.]. For example, building a  university’s educational information environment on  the basis of the knowledge management  technology is considered in [Kudinov, 2010].
environment on  the basis of the knowledge management  technology is considered in [Kudinov, 2010]. The ar ticle [Lishilin et al., 2015] describes a conceptua l  model of KMS for formation of professional competen ces in information technologies. The KMS  creation process requires its concept, model, and t ools of implementation. Note that the studied  literature does not address KMS integrating the ind ustry and industry-specific universities and colleg es  through the knowledge life cycle, and this substant iates the novelty of the business model proposed by   the authors.   3. Research Methods   During the research, the following methods were col lectively used: interdisciplinary analysis of  technical, economic, and pedagogical literature; st udying the best world practices in KMS  development; modeling; knowledge engineering method s.   4. Principal Results  The business model of interaction between productio n, science, and education in the industry-specific  REC through the integrated life cycle of knowledge is shown in Figure 1 where ISKLC is industry- specific knowledge life cycle and R&D is research a nd development.

Exchange of knowledge flows takes place in the inte llectual field of the industry, which includes  manufacturing enterprises and industry-specific uni versities and colleges. The latter act as research  centers of applied science with integrated research  laboratories, whose activities are aimed at solvin g  the industry’s critical production tasks. In the do main of the industry’s manufacturing enterprises, t heir  own “internal”—corporate—life cycle of knowledge is  formed. Similarly, in the domain of industry- specific universities and colleges, there is their own “internal”—academic—life cycle of knowledge.  As a result of the knowledge exchange, there appear s an integrated knowledge life cycle that is  common for the industry and industry-specific unive rsities and colleges. This justifies introduction o f  the concept of “industry-specific knowledge”, which  is understood as the entirety of the knowledge  circulating in a certain industry and reflecting th e specifics of activities of the enterprises and  organizations of this industry. This knowledge is c onstantly forming during interaction between  production, science, and education at the stages of  the integrated life cycle. Knowledge used in the  educational process of industry-specific universiti es and colleges belongs to industry-specific  knowledge. It has all the characteristics of indust ry-specific knowledge but is adapted for better  understanding by students [Mitsuk et al., 2016].  It is obvious that the integrated ISKLC is an attri bute of the “industry—industry-specific  universities and colleges” system; however, it has not been explicitly identified before. To overcome  the gap between the real production and
it has not been explicitly identified before. To overcome  the gap between the real production and professiona l education, the academic and corporate life cycles   should undergo regular synchronization. Certainly, such synchronization has always been carried out,  and the knowledge life cycle in the industry used t o be long enough to cope with the knowledge  mismatch. However, in the context of production dig italization, this mismatch is increasing so much  that syllabus becomes obsolete long before graduate s begin their independent labor activities.  Identification of the integrated ISKLC makes the pr ocess of interlinking and synchronization of local  knowledge life cycles of the industry and industry- specific universities and colleges controllable,  given the standardization of knowledge.

The value-oriented and communicational co mponent is represented by a network structure of  KMS users, which includes geographically distribute d industry-specific educational establishments  (universities and colleges, secondary specialized e ducational institutions), corporate universities,  manufacturing enterprises of the industry, R&D orga nizations, partner organizations (administration  agencies, business and professional communities, fo reign field-specific universities and colleges, etc .).  KMS users can be organized into two enlarged groups : authors of the content (experts from  production, scientists, teachers) and students. A f ormalized social network of industry-specific natur e,  within which the exchange of values, i.e. the knowl edge, takes place, is considered as the main form o f  interaction between the users.  An open educational resource whose content is devel oped with the use of ontology editors  supporting Semantic Web standards and stored as “kn owledge packages” in OWL (Ontology Web  Language) in a virtual environment is the core of t he functional and resource-related component.  A special system of distance learning provides mana gement of the ontological content. Finally, the  technical and methodological component includes sys tematic—technical and methodological— support of KMS users. Methodological support is an organized maintenance of the process of
support of KMS users. Methodological support is an organized maintenance of the process of KMS  implementation into educational practice by means o f the combination of models, techniques, and  instructions that are intended for subjects of the learning process and that ensure concurrence and  technological efficiency of actions of a team of th e open educational resource content developers.  Implementation of the proposed model of KMS require s creation of special tools. Such tools have  been developed for training transport industry engi neers and technicians; however, upon certain  adaptation, they can be used for training personnel  in other production industries. In particular, the   following software and methodological solutions hav e been developed: software with an embedded  multi-user ontology editor that supports Semantic W eb standards and allows for simultaneous work of  several authors on the development of ontologies of  training courses in a great number of natural  languages (at the commission of the Training and Me thodology Center for Railway Transport, Public  Contract No. 30/16 of June 30, 2016) [Khabarov V. I ., Volegzhanina I. S., 2018]; Onto.plus, a  multilingual e-learning environment prototype devel oped by means of this software, which allows  students to simultaneously use different forms of c ontent presentation (text, hypertext, ontology,  graph, multimedia) in various national languages [V olegzhanina et al., 2018; Khabarov, Volegzhanina,  2018]; a version of controllable Russian language a llowing for ontological content development by  Russian-speaking authors who do not have programmin g skills, as well as a methodology for creating  ontologies in the proposed variant of controllable Russian language; a model of actions sequence of  ontological content developers; a methodology for d eveloping the students’ cognitive skills on the  basis of ontologies.  5.

Digitalization of fers  opportunities for the birth of new, previously impo ssible business models, due to the “end-to-end”  technologies, with artificial intelligence being th e most important among them. Digital transformation   of production dictates digital transformation of pr ofessional education, which manifests in the  following: the form of knowledge presentation is ch anging; it becomes possible to standardize it  (ontologies are recognized as such standard), which  ensures “semantic” openness of educational  resources; technologies in education are changing: the management of a person’s educational path is  assigned to artificial intelligent training agents (AI-based tutors). As a result, the model of educat ion is

The teacher’ s role is expanding: he/she becomes a source of  expert knowledge, a knowledge technologist, a lectu rer, a mentor, and a scientist—all in one. The role   of students is also changing. Much of the study tim e will soon be devoted to the implementation of the   end-to-end interdisciplinary projects and self-lear ning activities. Finally, the nature of interaction   between the industry and industry-specific universi ties and colleges is changing as well.   The definition of an “industry-specific knowledge” has been proposed; identification of integrated  life cycle of industry-specific knowledge in the “i ndustry—industry-specific universities and colleges ”  system has been substantiated, which made it possib le to propose a business model of interaction  between production, science, and education in indus try-specific REC, as well as a mechanism of such  interaction: KMS. Structure of the KMS of industry- specific REC is represented by a set of the  following structural components: statutory and regu latory, value-oriented and communicational,  functional and resource-related, technical and meth odological. The content of the aforementioned  components makes it possible to define requirements  to the tools of the model implementation in the  educational practice. The following complex of soft ware and methodological solutions has been  developed, with due regard to such requirements: so ftware with the embedded multi-user ontology  editor that supports Semantic Web standards and the  method of knowledge presentation in controllable  Russian language; a prototype of multilingual e-lea rning environment based on ontologies; techniques  and instructions intended for KMS users: authors of  ontological content, teachers,
techniques  and instructions intended for KMS users: authors of  ontological content, teachers, students.   The developed software and methodological basis of KMS ensures its implementation and  development as an open project, in which the indust ry, industry-specific educational establishments,  and interested partners are involved.

The foregoing unveils opportunities for knowledge m anagement aimed at overcoming the gap  between the real production sector, achievements of  the applied science, and professional education, a s  well as outlines the benchmarks for the development  of a mechanism of their integration within the  industry-specific REC.  2. Current status of the problem  The modern science regards “knowledge management” a s an interdisciplinary category. Its formation  stages are described in the study [Sağsan et al., 2 016]. The first stage (1948–1994) is characterized by  the
described in the study [Sağsan et al., 2 016]. The first stage (1948–1994) is characterized by  the use of this term in such domains as artificial intelligence and cybernetics. The second stage (199 5– 2001) is associated with addressing the problems of  knowledge management at organizations and  emergence of such concepts as “intellectual capital ”, “on-the-job training”, “knowledge management  process”, etc. The third stage (2001–2004) deals wi th criticism and rethinking of the content of this  concept. The fourth stage (from 2005 to the present  day) marks the introduction of knowledge  management into the education sector. New studies a ppear where knowledge management is presented  as a comprehensive set of measures aimed at preserv ation of a corporation employee’s life cycle  [Antonova et al., 2006]. In the article of [Dante e t al., 2015], knowledge management is associated  with a number of milestone events that served as a catalyst for more active studying of professional  competence of a “labor subject”, namely: emergence of key technologies of the digital economy (in

Integration of participants of the industry-specifi c REC on the basis of knowledge management  requires a mechanism that is adequate in the contex t of digital transformations of production and  education. The knowledge management system (KMS) ca n be considered as such mechanism. KMS  are currently used in virtually all significant sec tors of the global economy. In Russia, they are  implemented at such industry-leading corporations a s Gazprom, Tatneft, Rosatom, RZD. Interest to  KMS development is also observed in pedagogy. Analy sis of scientific literature, the results of which  are provided in [Khabarov, Volegzhanina, 2018], has  shown that over the last ten years, the number of  studies dealing with the development of KMS in the education sector has considerably increased  [Gasmi, Bouras, 2018; Hornos et al, 2012; Khater et  al., 2015, etc.]. For example, building a  university’s educational information environment on  the basis of the knowledge management  technology is considered in [Kudinov, 2010].
environment on  the basis of the knowledge management  technology is considered in [Kudinov, 2010]. The ar ticle [Lishilin et al., 2015] describes a conceptua l  model of KMS for formation of professional competen ces in information technologies. The KMS  creation process requires its concept, model, and t ools of implementation. Note that the studied  literature does not address KMS integrating the ind ustry and industry-specific universities and colleg es  through the knowledge life cycle, and this substant iates the novelty of the business model proposed by   the authors.   3. Research Methods   During the research, the following methods were col lectively used: interdisciplinary analysis of  technical, economic, and pedagogical literature; st udying the best world practices in KMS  development; modeling; knowledge engineering method s.   4. Principal Results  The business model of interaction between productio n, science, and education in the industry-specific  REC through the integrated life cycle of knowledge is shown in Figure 1 where ISKLC is industry- specific knowledge life cycle and R&D is research a nd development.

Exchange of knowledge flows takes place in the inte llectual field of the industry, which includes  manufacturing enterprises and industry-specific uni versities and colleges. The latter act as research  centers of applied science with integrated research  laboratories, whose activities are aimed at solvin g  the industry’s critical production tasks. In the do main of the industry’s manufacturing enterprises, t heir  own “internal”—corporate—life cycle of knowledge is  formed. Similarly, in the domain of industry- specific universities and colleges, there is their own “internal”—academic—life cycle of knowledge.  As a result of the knowledge exchange, there appear s an integrated knowledge life cycle that is  common for the industry and industry-specific unive rsities and colleges. This justifies introduction o f  the concept of “industry-specific knowledge”, which  is understood as the entirety of the knowledge  circulating in a certain industry and reflecting th e specifics of activities of the enterprises and  organizations of this industry. This knowledge is c onstantly forming during interaction between  production, science, and education at the stages of  the integrated life cycle. Knowledge used in the  educational process of industry-specific universiti es and colleges belongs to industry-specific  knowledge. It has all the characteristics of indust ry-specific knowledge but is adapted for better  understanding by students [Mitsuk et al., 2016].  It is obvious that the integrated ISKLC is an attri bute of the “industry—industry-specific  universities and colleges” system; however, it has not been explicitly identified before. To overcome  the gap between the real production and --- it has not been explicitly identified before. To overcome  the gap between the real production and professiona l education, the academic and corporate life cycles   should undergo regular synchronization. Certainly, such synchronization has always been carried out,  and the knowledge life cycle in the industry used t o be long enough to cope with the knowledge  mismatch. However, in the context of production dig italization, this mismatch is increasing so much  that syllabus becomes obsolete long before graduate s begin their independent labor activities.  Identification of the integrated ISKLC makes the pr ocess of interlinking and synchronization of local  knowledge life cycles of the industry and industry- specific universities and colleges controllable,  given the standardization of knowledge. It also det ermines characteristics of the proposed business Industry-specific  universities and colleges   Integrated ISKLC  Internal KLC  (academic) Business processes,  educational programs,  proficiency enhancement  programs, consulting  R&D, patents, licenses,  standards, strategies,  technologies, library  collection Manufacturing enterprises of  the industry   Internal KLC  (corporate) Business processes,  proficiency enhancement  programs, trainings,  contests  Patents, licenses,  standards, norms,  strategies,  technologies, library  collection Graduates, R&D,  proficiency enhancement  programs, trainings,  consulting, projects Business processes,  regulatory documents,  projects, technologies,  best practices, experts Industry’s intellectual field

Series: Earth and Environmental Science 403 (2019) 012197IOP Publishing doi:10.1088/1755-1315/403/1/012197 6The statutory and regulatory component includes nor mative documents of the federal, sectoral and  local levels regulating the process of KMS developm ent and use (laws, guidelines, directives), web  technologies standards developed by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) (in particular, Semantic  Web), ISO/IEC standards of knowledge presentation f or certain industries of production and e- learning. The value-oriented and communicational co mponent is represented by a network structure of  KMS users, which includes geographically distribute d industry-specific educational establishments  (universities and colleges, secondary specialized e ducational institutions), corporate universities,  manufacturing enterprises of the industry, R&D orga nizations, partner organizations (administration  agencies, business and professional communities, fo reign field-specific universities and colleges, etc .).  KMS users can be organized into two enlarged groups : authors of the content (experts from  production, scientists, teachers) and students. A f ormalized social network of industry-specific natur e,  within which the exchange of values, i.e. the knowl edge, takes place, is considered as the main form o f  interaction between the users.  An open educational resource whose content is devel oped with the use of ontology editors  supporting Semantic Web standards and stored as “kn owledge packages” in OWL (Ontology Web  Language) in a virtual environment is the core of t he functional and resource-related component.  A special system of distance learning provides mana gement of the ontological content. Finally, the  technical and methodological component includes sys tematic—technical and methodological— support of KMS users. Methodological support is an organized maintenance of the process of
support of KMS users. Methodological support is an organized maintenance of the process of KMS  implementation into educational practice by means o f the combination of models, techniques, and  instructions that are intended for subjects of the learning process and that ensure concurrence and  technological efficiency of actions of a team of th e open educational resource content developers.  Implementation of the proposed model of KMS require s creation of special tools. Such tools have  been developed for training transport industry engi neers and technicians; however, upon certain  adaptation, they can be used for training personnel  in other production industries. In particular, the   following software and methodological solutions hav e been developed: software with an embedded  multi-user ontology editor that supports Semantic W eb standards and allows for simultaneous work of  several authors on the development of ontologies of  training courses in a great number of natural  languages (at the commission of the Training and Me thodology Center for Railway Transport, Public  Contract No. 30/16 of June 30, 2016) [Khabarov V. I ., Volegzhanina I. S., 2018]; Onto.plus, a  multilingual e-learning environment prototype devel oped by means of this software, which allows  students to simultaneously use different forms of c ontent presentation (text, hypertext, ontology,  graph, multimedia) in various national languages [V olegzhanina et al., 2018; Khabarov, Volegzhanina,  2018]; a version of controllable Russian language a llowing for ontological content development by  Russian-speaking authors who do not have programmin g skills, as well as a methodology for creating  ontologies in the proposed variant of controllable Russian language; a model of actions sequence of  ontological content developers; a methodology for d eveloping the students’ cognitive skills on the  basis of ontologies.  5.

Digitalization of fers  opportunities for the birth of new, previously impo ssible business models, due to the “end-to-end”  technologies, with artificial intelligence being th e most important among them. Digital transformation   of production dictates digital transformation of pr ofessional education, which manifests in the  following: the form of knowledge presentation is ch anging; it becomes possible to standardize it  (ontologies are recognized as such standard), which  ensures “semantic” openness of educational  resources; technologies in education are changing: the management of a person’s educational path is  assigned to artificial intelligent training agents (AI-based tutors). As a result, the model of educat ion is

The teacher’ s role is expanding: he/she becomes a source of  expert knowledge, a knowledge technologist, a lectu rer, a mentor, and a scientist—all in one. The role   of students is also changing. Much of the study tim e will soon be devoted to the implementation of the   end-to-end interdisciplinary projects and self-lear ning activities. Finally, the nature of interaction   between the industry and industry-specific universi ties and colleges is changing as well.   The definition of an “industry-specific knowledge” has been proposed; identification of integrated  life cycle of industry-specific knowledge in the “i ndustry—industry-specific universities and colleges ”  system has been substantiated, which made it possib le to propose a business model of interaction  between production, science, and education in indus try-specific REC, as well as a mechanism of such  interaction: KMS. Structure of the KMS of industry- specific REC is represented by a set of the  following structural components: statutory and regu latory, value-oriented and communicational,  functional and resource-related, technical and meth odological. The content of the aforementioned  components makes it possible to define requirements  to the tools of the model implementation in the  educational practice. The following complex of soft ware and methodological solutions has been  developed, with due regard to such requirements: so ftware with the embedded multi-user ontology  editor that supports Semantic Web standards and the  method of knowledge presentation in controllable  Russian language; a prototype of multilingual e-lea rning environment based on ontologies; techniques  and instructions intended for KMS users: authors of  ontological content, teachers,
techniques  and instructions intended for KMS users: authors of  ontological content, teachers, students.   The developed software and methodological basis of KMS ensures its implementation and  development as an open project, in which the indust ry, industry-specific educational establishments,  and interested partners are involved.
