Srinath  K. L. University, Vaddeswaram, Guntur Dt, Andhra Pradesh, India        Abstract —Laboratories are workplaces for the conduct of  experimentation across disciplines and perform interdisci- plinary scientific research. Th is work will summarize the  key architectural, engineering , and operational, safety, and  sustainability considerations fo r the design Laboratories.  The author recognizes that in the 21st century we are push- ing project design teams to crea te research laboratories that  are responsive to current and future needs, that encourage interaction among students as well as researchers from  various disciplines, that help recruit and retain qualified  scientists, and that facilitates partnerships and development.  Index Terms —Laboratories design, me chanical needs, elec- trical needs, economical aspects  I. ARCHITECTURAL CONSIDERATIONS   Over the past 30 years, arch itects, engineers, facility  managers, and researchers have refined the design of  typical wet and dry labs to a very high level. The follow- ing identifies the best solutions in designing a typical lab.  A. Lab Planning Module  The laboratory module is the key unit in any lab facil- ity. When designed correctly, a lab module will fully  coordinate all the architectural  and engineering systems. A  well-designed modular plan will provide the following benefits:   Flexibility —“The lab module should encourage  change" within the building. Research is changing all the time, and buildings must allow for reasonable  change. Many private research companies make  physical changes to an aver age of 25% of their labs  each year. Most academic institutions annually change the layout of 5 to 10% of their labs, this is be- ing noticed annually across the globe.
change the layout of 5 to 10% of their labs, this is be- ing noticed annually across the globe.    Expansion —The use of lab planning modules allows  the building to adapt easily to needed expansions or  contractions without sacrif icing facility and function- ality.    A common laboratory module has a width of approxi- mately 10 ft. 6 in. but will vary in depth from 20-30 ft.  The depth is based on the size necessary for the lab and  the cost-effectiveness of the stru ctural  system. The 10 ft. 6  in. dimension is based on two rows of casework and equipment (each row 2 ft. 6 in. deep) on each wall, a 5 ft. aisle, and 6 in. for the wall thickness that separates one lab     Figure 1.  Building Attributes: Labs designed with overhead connects  and disconnects allow for flexibility and fast hook up of equipment.  from another. The 5 ft. aisle width should be considered a minimum  because  of  the requirements of  the  statutory  norms of any Government Councils on Education and  Technology which are as per the American standards  generally.  Two-Directional Lab Module —Another level of flexi- bility can be achieved by designing a lab module that works in both directions. This allows the casework to be  organized in either direction. This concept is more flexible  than the basic lab module concept but may require more  space. The use of a two-directional grid is beneficial to  accommodate different lengths of run for casework. The  casework may have to be moved to create a different type  or size of workstation.  Three-Dimensional Lab Module —the three- dimensional lab module planning concept combines the basic lab module or a two-directional lab module with any  lab corridor arrangement for each floor of a building. This  means that a three-dimensional lab module can have a  single-corridor arrangement on one floor, a two-corridor  layout on another, and so on. To create a three- dimensional lab module:   A basic or two-directional lab module must be de- fined.  
a three- dimensional lab module:   A basic or two-directional lab module must be de- fined.   All vertical risers must be fully coordinated. (Vertical  risers include fire stairs, elevators, restrooms, and  shafts for utilities.)   The mechanical, electrical , and plumbing systems  must be coordinated in the ceiling to work with the multiple corridor arrangements.  iJET – Volume 5, Issue 3, September 2010 47
LABORATORY DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES AND OBTAINING GREATER EFFICACY   B. Lab Planning Concepts  The relationship of the labs, offices, and corridor will  have a significant impact on the functioning and research  outputs of any Institution.   Do the end users want a view from their labs to the  exterior, or will the labs be located on the interior,  with wall space used for casework and equipment?   Some researchers do not want or cannot have natural  light in their re search sp aces. Special instruments and  equi pment, such as nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) apparatus, electron microscopes, and lasers cannot function properly in natural light. Natural daylight is not desired in vivarium facilities or in  some  support spaces, so these are located in the inte- rior of the building.   Zoning the building between lab and non-lab spaces  will reduce costs. Labs require 100% outside air  while non-lab spaces can be designed with re- circulated air, like an office building.   Adjacencies with corridors can be orga nized with a  single, two corridor (racetra c k), or a three corridor  scheme. There are number of variations to organize each type. Illustrated in Figures 2, 3 and 4 are three  ways to organize a single corridor scheme.   Open labs vs. closed labs. An increasing number of  research institutions are creating "open" labs to sup- port team-based work. The open lab concept is sig- nificantly different from that of the "closed" lab of  the past, which was based on accommodating the in-dividual principle investigator. In open labs, re- searchers share not only the space itself but also  equipment, bench space, and support staff. The open  lab format facilitates communication between scien- tists and makes the lab more easily adaptable for fu- ture needs. A wide variety of labs—from wet biology  and chemistry labs, to engineering labs, to dry com- puter science facilities—are now being designed as  open labs.    C. Flexibility  In
to dry com- puter science facilities—are now being designed as  open labs.    C. Flexibility  In today's lab, the ability to expand, reconfigure, and  permit multiple uses has become a key concern. The fol-lowing should be considered to achieve this:  1) Flexible Lab Interiors   Equipment zones—These should be created in the initial design to accommodate  equipment, fixed, or  movable casework at a later date.   Generic labs   Mobile casework—This can be comprised of mobile  tables and mobile base cabinets. It allows researchers  to configure and fit out the lab based on their needs  as opposed to adjusting to pre-determined fixed  casework (see Figure 5).   Flexible partitions—These can be taken down and put back up in another loca tion, allowing lab spaces  to be configured in a variety of sizes.   Overhead service carriers—These are hung from the ceiling. They can have utilities like piping, electric,  data, light fixtures, and snorkel exhausts. They afford  maximum flexibility as services are lifted off the  floor, allowing free floor space to be configured as  needed.    Figure 2.

LABORATORY DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES AND OBTAINING GREATER EFFICACY   2) Flexible Engineering Systems   Labs should have easy connects/disconnects at walls  and ceilings to allow for fast and affordable hook up  of equipment..   The Engineering systems should be designed such that fume hoods can be added or removed.   Space should be allowed in the utility corridors, ceil- ings, and vertical chases for future HVAC, plumbing, and electric needs.  D. Mechanical Systems  The location of main vertical supply/exhaust shafts as  well as horizontal ductwork is very crucial in designing a flexible lab. Key issues to co nsider and include: efficiency  and flexibility, modular design, less initial costs, long- term  operational costs, building height and massing, and  design image.  The vari o us design options fo r the mechanical systems  are illustrated in Figures 6 to 10.  E. Electrical Systems  Three types of power are generally used for most labo- ratory projects:   Normal power circuits are connected to the utility  supply only, without any backup system. Loads that  are typically on normal power include some HVAC  equipment, general lighting, and most lab equipment.   Emergency power is created with generators that will  back up equipment such as refrigerators, freezers,  fume hoods, biological safety cabinets, emergency  lighting, exhaust fans, animal facilities, and environ- mental rooms. Examples of safe and efficient emer- gency power equipment include distributed energy  resou r ces (DER), micro turbines, and fuel cells.   An uni nterruptible power supply (UPS) is used for  data recording, certain computers, microprocessor- controlled equipment, and possibly the vivarium  area. The UPS can be either  a central unit or a port- able system, such as distributed energy resources  (DER), micro turbines, fuel cells, and building inte- grated p hoto voltaic (BIPV).    The following should be considered:   Load estimation   Site
grated p hoto voltaic (BIPV).    The following should be considered:   Load estimation   Site distribution   Power quality   Management of electrical cable trays/panel boxes   Lighting design   o User expectations  o Illumination levels  o Uniformity  o Lighting distribution—indirect, direct, combina- tion  o Luminaire location and orientation—lighting par- allel to casework and lighting perpendicular to  casework   Telephone and data systems  o Piping Systems  There are several key design goals to strive for in de- signing laboratory piping systems:    Figure 6.  Shafts at the end of the building    Figure 7.  Shafts in the middle of the building    Figure 8.  Exhaust at end and supply in the middle    Figure 9.  Multiple internal shafts    Figure 10.  Shafts on the exterior   Provide a flexible design that allows for easy renova- tion and modifications.   Provide appropriate plum bing systems for each labo- ratory based on the lab programming.   Provide systems that minimize energy usage.   Provi de equi pment arrangements that minimize  downtime in the event of a failure.   Locate shutoff valves wher e they are accessible and  easily understood.   Accomplish all of the preceding goals within the con-struction budget.  iJET – Volume 5, Issue 3, September 2010 49
LABORATORY DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES AND OBTAINING GREATER EFFICACY   II. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE   A. Cost Savings  The following cost saving items can be considered  without compromising quality and flexibility:   Separate lab and non-lab zones.   Try to design with standard building components in- stead of customized components   Identify at least three manuf acturers of each material  or piece of equipment specifi ed to ensure competitive  bidding for the work.   Locate fume hoods on upper floors to minimize duct-work and the cost of moving air through the building.   Evaluate whether process piping should be handled  centrally or locally. In many cases it is more cost- effective to locate gases, in  cylinders, at the source in  the lab instead of centrally.   Create equipment zones to minimize the amount of  casework necessary in the initial construction.   Provide space for equipment (e.g., ice machine) that  also can be shared with othe r labs in the entry alcove  to the lab. Shared  amenities can be more efficient and  cost-effective.   Consider designating instrument rooms as cross- corridors, saving space as well as encouraging re- searchers to share equipment.   Design easy-to-maintain, energy-efficient building  systems. Expose mechanical, plumbing, and electri- cal systems for easy maintenance access from the lab.   Locate all mechanical equipm ent centrally, either on  a lower level of the building or on the penthouse level.   Stack vertical elements a bove each other without re- quiring transfers from floor to floor. Such elements  include columns, stairs, mechanical closets, and rest- rooms.  III. L AB AND PERSONNEL SAFETY AND SECURITY   Protecting human health and life is paramount, and  safety must always be the first concern in laboratory bu ilding design. Security—protecting a facility from un- authorized access—is also of critical importance. Today,  research facility designers must work within the
access—is also of critical importance. Today,  research facility designers must work within the dense  regulatory environment in order to create safe and produc- tive lab spaces.   Laboratory classifications: dependent on the amount  and type of chemicals in the lab;   Containment devices: fume hoods and bio-safety  cabinets;   Levels of bio-safety containment as a design princi-ple;   Radiation safety;   Employee safety: showers, eyewashes, other protec-tive measures; and   Emergency power.  IV. S USTAINABILITY CONSIDERATIONS   The typical laboratory uses far more energy and water  per square foot than the typical office building due to intensive ventilation requirements and other health and safety concerns. Therefore, designers should strive to create sustainable, high perform ance, and low-energy  labo ratories that will:   Minimize overall environmental impacts;   Protect occupant safety; and   Optim i ze whole building efficiency on a life-cycle  basis.  V. THREE LABORATORY SECTORS   There are three research laboratory sectors. They are  academic laboratories, government laboratories, and pri- vate sector laboratories.   Academic labs are primarily teaching facilities but  also include some research labs that engage in public interest or profit generating research.   Government labs  include those run by federal agen- cies and those operated by state government do re-search in the public interest.   Design of labs for the private sector , run by corpora- tions, is usually driven by the need to enhance the re- search operation's profit making potential.  VI. RELEVANT CODES AND STANDARDS   The following agencies and organizations have devel- oped codes and standards affecting the design of research laboratories. Note that the codes and standards are mini- mum requirements. Architects, engineers, and consultants  should consider exceeding th e applicable requirements  whenever possible.   29 CFR 1910.1450: OSHA—Occupational Expo-sures to Hazardous
requirements  whenever possible.   29 CFR 1910.1450: OSHA—Occupational Expo-sures to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories   ISEA Z358.1—Emergency  Eyewash and Shower  Equip ment   ANSI/AIHA—American National Standard Z9.5 for Labo ratory Ventilation   Association for Assessment and Accreditation of  Laborat ory Animal Care (AAALAC) standards   Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National In- stitutes of Health— Biosafety in Microbiological and  Biom  edical Laboratories, 4th Edition . 1999.   Department of Veterans Affairs Research Laboratory  Design Guide    Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service, P100  by   the General Services Administration (GSA).   National Institutes of Health— NIH Design Policy  an d Guidelines    National Institutes of Health (NIH)— Guidelines for  the Laboratory Use of Chemical Carcinogens, Pub.

A common laboratory module has a width of approxi- mately 10 ft. 6 in. but will vary in depth from 20-30 ft.  The depth is based on the size necessary for the lab and  the cost-effectiveness of the stru ctural  system. The 10 ft. 6  in. dimension is based on two rows of casework and equipment (each row 2 ft. 6 in. deep) on each wall, a 5 ft. aisle, and 6 in. for the wall thickness that separates one lab     Figure 1.

The 5 ft. aisle width should be considered a minimum  because  of  the requirements of  the  statutory  norms of any Government Councils on Education and  Technology which are as per the American standards  generally.  Two-Directional Lab Module —Another level of flexi- bility can be achieved by designing a lab module that works in both directions. This allows the casework to be  organized in either direction. This concept is more flexible  than the basic lab module concept but may require more  space. The use of a two-directional grid is beneficial to  accommodate different lengths of run for casework. The  casework may have to be moved to create a different type  or size of workstation.  Three-Dimensional Lab Module —the three- dimensional lab module planning concept combines the basic lab module or a two-directional lab module with any  lab corridor arrangement for each floor of a building. This  means that a three-dimensional lab module can have a  single-corridor arrangement on one floor, a two-corridor  layout on another, and so on. To create a three- dimensional lab module:   A basic or two-directional lab module must be de- fined.  

LABORATORY DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES AND OBTAINING GREATER EFFICACY   B. Lab Planning Concepts  The relationship of the labs, offices, and corridor will  have a significant impact on the functioning and research  outputs of any Institution.   Do the end users want a view from their labs to the  exterior, or will the labs be located on the interior,  with wall space used for casework and equipment?   Some researchers do not want or cannot have natural  light in their re search sp aces. Special instruments and  equi pment, such as nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) apparatus, electron microscopes, and lasers cannot function properly in natural light. Natural daylight is not desired in vivarium facilities or in  some  support spaces, so these are located in the inte- rior of the building.   Zoning the building between lab and non-lab spaces  will reduce costs. Labs require 100% outside air  while non-lab spaces can be designed with re- circulated air, like an office building.   Adjacencies with corridors can be orga nized with a  single, two corridor (racetra c k), or a three corridor  scheme. There are number of variations to organize each type. Illustrated in Figures 2, 3 and 4 are three  ways to organize a single corridor scheme.   Open labs vs. closed labs. An increasing number of  research institutions are creating "open" labs to sup- port team-based work. The open lab concept is sig- nificantly different from that of the "closed" lab of  the past, which was based on accommodating the in-dividual principle investigator. In open labs, re- searchers share not only the space itself but also  equipment, bench space, and support staff. The open  lab format facilitates communication between scien- tists and makes the lab more easily adaptable for fu- ture needs.

LABORATORY DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES AND OBTAINING GREATER EFFICACY   2) Flexible Engineering Systems   Labs should have easy connects/disconnects at walls  and ceilings to allow for fast and affordable hook up  of equipment..   The Engineering systems should be designed such that fume hoods can be added or removed.   Space should be allowed in the utility corridors, ceil- ings, and vertical chases for future HVAC, plumbing, and electric needs.  D. Mechanical Systems  The location of main vertical supply/exhaust shafts as  well as horizontal ductwork is very crucial in designing a flexible lab. Key issues to co nsider and include: efficiency  and flexibility, modular design, less initial costs, long- term  operational costs, building height and massing, and  design image.  The vari o us design options fo r the mechanical systems  are illustrated in Figures 6 to 10.  E. Electrical Systems  Three types of power are generally used for most labo- ratory projects:   Normal power circuits are connected to the utility  supply only, without any backup system. Loads that  are typically on normal power include some HVAC  equipment, general lighting, and most lab equipment.   Emergency power is created with generators that will  back up equipment such as refrigerators, freezers,  fume hoods, biological safety cabinets, emergency  lighting, exhaust fans, animal facilities, and environ- mental rooms. Examples of safe and efficient emer- gency power equipment include distributed energy  resou r ces (DER), micro turbines, and fuel cells.   An uni nterruptible power supply (UPS) is used for  data recording, certain computers, microprocessor- controlled equipment, and possibly the vivarium  area. The UPS can be either  a central unit or a port- able system, such as distributed energy resources  (DER), micro turbines, fuel cells, and building inte- grated p hoto voltaic (BIPV).    The following should be considered:   Load estimation   Site

The following should be considered:   Load estimation   Site distribution   Power quality   Management of electrical cable trays/panel boxes   Lighting design   o User expectations  o Illumination levels  o Uniformity  o Lighting distribution—indirect, direct, combina- tion  o Luminaire location and orientation—lighting par- allel to casework and lighting perpendicular to  casework   Telephone and data systems  o Piping Systems  There are several key design goals to strive for in de- signing laboratory piping systems:    Figure 6.

LABORATORY DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES AND OBTAINING GREATER EFFICACY   II. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE   A. Cost Savings  The following cost saving items can be considered  without compromising quality and flexibility:   Separate lab and non-lab zones.   Try to design with standard building components in- stead of customized components   Identify at least three manuf acturers of each material  or piece of equipment specifi ed to ensure competitive  bidding for the work.   Locate fume hoods on upper floors to minimize duct-work and the cost of moving air through the building.   Evaluate whether process piping should be handled  centrally or locally. In many cases it is more cost- effective to locate gases, in  cylinders, at the source in  the lab instead of centrally.   Create equipment zones to minimize the amount of  casework necessary in the initial construction.   Provide space for equipment (e.g., ice machine) that  also can be shared with othe r labs in the entry alcove  to the lab. Shared  amenities can be more efficient and  cost-effective.   Consider designating instrument rooms as cross- corridors, saving space as well as encouraging re- searchers to share equipment.   Design easy-to-maintain, energy-efficient building  systems. Expose mechanical, plumbing, and electri- cal systems for easy maintenance access from the lab.   Locate all mechanical equipm ent centrally, either on  a lower level of the building or on the penthouse level.   Stack vertical elements a bove each other without re- quiring transfers from floor to floor. Such elements  include columns, stairs, mechanical closets, and rest- rooms.  III. L AB AND PERSONNEL SAFETY AND SECURITY   Protecting human health and life is paramount, and  safety must always be the first concern in laboratory bu ilding design. Security—protecting a facility from un- authorized access—is also of critical importance. Today,  research facility designers must work within the
access—is also of critical importance. Today,  research facility designers must work within the dense  regulatory environment in order to create safe and produc- tive lab spaces.   Laboratory classifications: dependent on the amount  and type of chemicals in the lab;   Containment devices: fume hoods and bio-safety  cabinets;   Levels of bio-safety containment as a design princi-ple;   Radiation safety;   Employee safety: showers, eyewashes, other protec-tive measures; and   Emergency power.  IV. S USTAINABILITY CONSIDERATIONS   The typical laboratory uses far more energy and water  per square foot than the typical office building due to intensive ventilation requirements and other health and safety concerns. Therefore, designers should strive to create sustainable, high perform ance, and low-energy  labo ratories that will:   Minimize overall environmental impacts;   Protect occupant safety; and   Optim i ze whole building efficiency on a life-cycle  basis.  V. THREE LABORATORY SECTORS   There are three research laboratory sectors. They are  academic laboratories, government laboratories, and pri- vate sector laboratories.   Academic labs are primarily teaching facilities but  also include some research labs that engage in public interest or profit generating research.   Government labs  include those run by federal agen- cies and those operated by state government do re-search in the public interest.   Design of labs for the private sector , run by corpora- tions, is usually driven by the need to enhance the re- search operation's profit making potential.  VI. RELEVANT CODES AND STANDARDS   The following agencies and organizations have devel- oped codes and standards affecting the design of research laboratories. Note that the codes and standards are mini- mum requirements. Architects, engineers, and consultants  should consider exceeding th e applicable requirements  whenever possible.   29 CFR 1910.1450: OSHA—Occupational Expo-sures to Hazardous --- requirements  whenever possible.   29 CFR 1910.1450: OSHA—Occupational Expo-sures to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories   ISEA Z358.1—Emergency  Eyewash and Shower  Equip ment   ANSI/AIHA—American National Standard Z9.5 for Labo ratory Ventilation   Association for Assessment and Accreditation of  Laborat ory Animal Care (AAALAC) standards   Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National In- stitutes of Health— Biosafety in Microbiological and  Biom  edical Laboratories, 4th Edition . 1999.   Department of Veterans Affairs Research Laboratory  Design Guide    Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service, P100  by   the General Services Administration (GSA).   National Institutes of Health— NIH Design Policy  an d Guidelines    National Institutes of Health (NIH)— Guidelines for  the Laboratory Use of Chemical Carcinogens, Pub.

El autor del texto aborda la importancia de diseñar laboratorios de investigación eficientes en el uso de recursos y con una mayor eficacia en su funcionamiento. Se destaca la necesidad de considerar aspectos arquitectónicos, de ingeniería, operativos, de seguridad y sostenibilidad en el diseño de laboratorios para fomentar la interacción entre estudiantes e investigadores de diversas disciplinas y la atracción y retención de científicos calificados.

En cuanto a consideraciones arquitectónicas, se menciona que en las últimas tres décadas se ha refinado el diseño de laboratorios húmedos y secos a un nivel muy alto. Se destaca la importancia de planificar correctamente el módulo del laboratorio, coordinando todos los sistemas arquitectónicos e ingenieriles. La flexibilidad es clave en el diseño de laboratorios, ya que la investigación está en constante cambio. Se menciona que muchas empresas privadas realizan cambios físicos en un promedio del 25% de sus laboratorios cada año, mientras que las instituciones académicas cambian la distribución de entre el 5% y el 10% de sus laboratorios anualmente.

Se destaca la importancia de la expansión de los laboratorios utilizando módulos de planificación que permiten adaptarse fácilmente a expansiones o contracciones necesarias sin sacrificar la funcionalidad. Se menciona la utilidad de módulos de laboratorio bidireccionales y tridimensionales para aumentar la flexibilidad en el diseño. Se detallan los pasos necesarios para crear un módulo de laboratorio tridimensional, incluyendo la definición de un módulo básico o bidireccional y la importancia de diseñar laboratorios con conexiones y desconexiones aéreas para una rápida conexión de equipos.

En cuanto a la flexibilidad en el diseño de laboratorios, se menciona la importancia de adaptarse a los cambios en la investigación y las necesidades de los usuarios. Se destaca la necesidad de considerar aspectos de ingeniería mecánica y eléctrica para garantizar una utilización efectiva de los recursos y una mayor eficacia en su funcionamiento. Se mencionan diferentes diseños de laboratorios con una sola pasarela, con oficinas adyacentes, agrupadas al final y en el medio, o con grupos de oficinas que acceden directamente a los laboratorios principales.

En cuanto a la sostenibilidad, se señala que los laboratorios consumen más energía y agua que los edificios de oficinas debido a los requisitos intensivos de ventilación. Por lo tanto, se deben crear laboratorios sostenibles, de alto rendimiento y bajo consumo de energía que minimicen los impactos ambientales y optimicen la eficiencia del edificio en todo su ciclo de vida.

Se mencionan diferentes sectores de laboratorios de investigación y se destacan agencias y organizaciones que han desarrollado códigos y normas que afectan el diseño de laboratorios. Se proporcionan recursos y referencias relacionados con el diseño de laboratorios para maximizar recursos y lograr una mayor eficacia. En resumen, el texto sirve como una guía integral para el diseño, construcción y renovación de laboratorios, brindando recomendaciones para maximizar recursos y lograr una mayor eficacia en entornos de laboratorio.
