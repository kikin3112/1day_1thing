Experience-based learning: a model linking the processes and outcomes of medical students’workplace learning Tim Dornan,1Henny Boshuizen,2Nigel King3& Albert Scherpbier4 OBJECTIVE To develop a model linking the proces- ses and outcomes of workplace learning. METHODS We synthesised a model from grounded theory analysis of group discussions before and afterexperimental strengthening of medical students’workplace learning. The research was conductedwithin a problem-based clinical curriculum with littleearly workplace experience, involving 24 junior and12 senior medical students. RESULTS To reach their ultimate goal of helping patients, medical students must develop 2 qualities.One is practical competence; the other is a state ofmind that includes conﬁdence, motivation and asense of professional identity. These 2 qualities rein-force one another. The core process of clinicalworkplace learning involves /C212participation in prac- tice /C213, which evolves along a spectrum from passive observation to performance. Practitioners helpstudents participate by being both supportive andchallenging. The presentation of clear learningobjectives and continuous periods of attachment thatare as personal to the student(s) and practitioner(s)as possible promote workplace learning. CONCLUSIONS The core condition for clinical workplace learning is /C212supported participation /C213, the various outcomes of which are mutually reinforcingand also reinforce students’ ability to participate infurther practice. This synthesis has 2 important implications for contemporary medical education: any reduction in medical students’ participation in clinical practice that results from the patient safetyagenda and expanded numbers of medical studentsis likely to have an adverse effect on learning, and theconstruct of /C212self-directed learning /C213, which our respondents too often found synonymous with /C212lack of support /C213, should be applied with very great caution to medical students’ learning
/C212lack of support /C213, should be applied with very great caution to medical students’ learning in clinical workplaces.

Today’s students learn practically relevant theory in seminar rooms using well theorised methods1sup- ported by empirical evidence of effectiveness.2They learn skills through high-ﬁdelity simulation.3How- ever, they integrate their knowledge and skills inworkplaces through a process for which there are nobetter descriptors than /C212senior surgery /C213,/C212clinical teaching /C213,o r /C212primary care placements /C213. The work- place is where competence has eventually to be applied; it is the /C212theatre /C213for much of a doctor’s undergraduate and postgraduate education; work-place education is self-evidently important. However,the published literature mostly pertains to speciﬁccontexts (hospital ﬁrms, 4community settings,5 ambulatory education,6day surgery units7) and failsworkplace learning 1Hope Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK 2Open University of the Netherlands, Heerlen, The Netherlands 3Department of Psychology, University of Huddersﬁeld, Huddersﬁeld, UK 4Department of Educational Development and Research, University of Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands Correspondence : Dr Tim Dornan, Hope Hospital, Stott Lane, Salford, Manchester M6 8HD, UK.

to identify causal links between the processes and outcomes that are expected of a contemporary,integrated curriculum. We have synthesised students’narratives of how they learn in workplaces with adetailed literature review presented elsewhere 8into a testable model of workplace learning. METHODS Context The context was the Salford Sector of the University of Manchester Medical School. The curriculum is of a contemporary type with a spiral, fully horizontallyintegrated design that uses problem-based learning(PBL) methods through all 5 years. After limitedclinical exposure in Years 1 and 2, students continuethematic learning in Years 3 and 4, but now withclinical skills training and simultaneous communityand hospital attachments to provide access to a breadth of clinical problems and contexts. 9In Year 5, they have one-to-one attachments to clinicians andcontinue to attend group tutorials, but now use realpatients as triggers for PBL. 10Study design Students at the end of Year 3 were chosen as index respondents because they have had nearly a year’s clinical experience but are still junior. A tutorial group of 8 students on a 7-week attachment to 1 ﬁrm took partin a semistructured group discussion. Following theinterview template used in a previous survey of staff, 11 they discussed how successfully they had learned fromclinical experience, what factors had helped or hin-dered their learning, ways by which their learningmight have been improved, and the roles of their teachers. A provisional analysis of their narratives provided the starting point for a /C212complex interven- tion /C213, 12which included more comprehensive brieﬁng, mentoring, and reﬂective debrieﬁng on experience asdescribed in detail elsewhere. 13All 8 clinically naı ¨ve students non-purposively allocated to the ﬁrm at thestart of the next academic year gave informed, verbalconsent to take part in a group discussion after experiencing the modiﬁed ﬁrm for 7 weeks.

a group discussion after experiencing the modiﬁed ﬁrm for 7 weeks. To triangulate and extend those observations, a group of 9Year 5 students and a mixed group of 3 Year 5 and 8Year 3 students who had spent 20% of their time inprimary care and experienced a variety of hospitalsgave a senior student retrospect and compared seniorand junior student perspectives on clinical learning. Roles of the researchers Having become experienced as a /C212participant obser- ver /C213, 11,13the ﬁrst author conducted the index discus- sion and complex intervention with students attachedto the ﬁrm on which he was 1 of 5 consultants. He keptdaily ﬁeld notes and students kept daily written recordsof their learning. His co-researchers helped him identify preconceptions and biases that might colour his interpretation, 11supervised the study to identify bias in its conduct, and compared his evolving inter-pretation against the original narratives. A secondauthor and a clinical academic (not an author)observed the discussion with intervention groupstudents to identify undue inﬂuence on their opinions.Unlike the Year 3 students, who were all taught by the ﬁrst author, few of the Year 5 students had been placed with him and some had never met him. A third author,who never met the students, supervised the study. Afourth author, naı ¨ve to the conduct of the study, critiqued a provisional interpretation against theoriginal transcripts. Analytical methods Each discussion was analysed in enough detail to inform the next, but the grounded theory analysis wasOverview What is already known on this subject Descriptions of clinical workplace learning are usually tied to specific contexts and disciplinesin which it is delivered ( /C212firms /C213,/C212paediatrics /C213, /C212ambulatory care education /C213) and concentrate more on teaching ( /C212clinical teaching /C213) than learning.

RESULTS 1 Participation as the core condition for learning Despite their exposure to primary care, respondents spoke mostly about hospital experiences (1.1). Theylearned best by participating in practice but theirworkplace experiences were not all participative. Asthey became more senior, learning activities had tobe close to the role of a practitioner to be experi- enced as participative. 2 The nature of participation2a Observation as participationObservation could be active or passive. Passive observation allowed respondents to glean knowledge and encounter realities they had learned about in theory but which gave, at best, a transient sense ofparticipation. Interaction with doctors and nursesmade observation a more participative and instructiveexperience and respondents became frustrated whenthat interaction was lacking.

whenthat interaction was lacking. (2a.1). 2b /C212Acting /C213as participation Performing clinical tasks made students participants by changing them from the status of observers to thatof actors (2b.1). However, even acting could be moreor less participative. Clerking a patient who hadalready been clerked by a doctor was rehearsal (2b.2).An act became performance and a respondent’s sense of participation increased when the task con-tributed to patient care (2b.3). There were, of course,some tasks that had to be rehearsed before respond- ents could perform them but there were others, such as calling a patient into a consulting room orcompleting a request form (2b.4), that could giveeven junior students a sense of participation. 3 Factors affecting participation3a Interaction with patients The wish to beneﬁt patients had led many respond- ents to study medicine (3a.1) but their early attemptsto participate were hampered by fear of doing just theopposite (3a.2). Doctors made participation easier byintroducing respondents to patients as /C212doctors-to-be /C213 and recognising the quality of their early rehearsals(3a.1). Building social relationships with patients increased inexperienced respondents’ sense of par- ticipation (3a.3) and success gave them more con-ﬁdence to participate on another occasion. Beingtaken to the bedside in a large group, by contrast,could be a very negative experience of non-partici-pation because respondents were not just observingpassively but invading a patient’s privacy. (3a.4). 3b Interaction with doctors 3b.1 Doctors’ behaviour towards studentsSome doctors showed their unwillingness to support participation by failing to greet respondents whenthey arrived, providing no timetable, cancellingteaching, failing to turn up, or allowing themselves to be bleeped away (3b.1.1). Others actively supported participation by providing ready access to theirpractice (3b.1.2), sharing their clinical expertise(3b.1.3), and creating tasks for respondents
(3b.1.2), sharing their clinical expertise(3b.1.3), and creating tasks for respondents toperform (3b.1.4). The pressures of practice ampliﬁeddoctors’ (un)willingness to support student partici-pation, with some becoming unfriendly and relega-ting students to the role of passive observers (3b.1.5), and others asking them to help out (3b.1.6). There was a dynamic between doctor and respondent suchthat students who were clear what they wanted tolearn, unafraid to ask questions and practicallycompetent had the best chance of participating(3b.1.7). Challenging respondents with a question ortask increased their participation provided the chal-lenge was appropriate to their level of experience and made in a supportive way (3b.1.8). Teachers could strike the right balance between support and demandby amicably /C212grilling /C213respondents (3b.1.9) and theworkplace learning 86 /C211Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

wrong balance by asking questions in a belittling way or using a respondent as a menial pair of hands(3b.1.10). 3b.2 The climate of the medical team The personalities of doctors had a pervasive inﬂu- ence on the learning climate of a ﬁrm. Some seniorshelped respondents participate by increasing theirjuniors’ interest in teaching (3b.2.1), whereas othersleft their juniors unsupported, unaccountable andunrewarded (3b.2.2). 3b.3 Doctors’ knowledge of the curriculum Doctors’ familiarity with the curriculum also affected respondents’ participation. A common obstacle toparticipation was the misconception that teachersshould not divulge answers or share their expertise ina PBL curriculum (3b.3.1). 3c Interaction with nurses Nurses had a powerful inﬂuence for good or ill on respondents’ participation (3c.1) They could leaverespondents feeling passive, unskilled and unconﬁ-dent by claiming they had arrived unannounced.Sometimes they even denied respondents access to the workplace. At the other extreme, they could be welcoming, supportive, willing to share their expertise,and able to offset the /C212scariness /C213of doctors (3c.2). Respondents’ experiences with nurses were morepositive in outpatient than ward settings, in districtthan teaching hospitals, with specialist rather thangeneralist nurses, and as senior rather than juniormedical students. Respondents contrasted their situ- ation unfavourably with that of student nurses, who wore uniforms, had one-to-one relationships withtrained nurses, had their own patients, had deﬁnedresponsibilities, were a useful part of the workforce,and /C212were training to be nurses rather than pass exams /C213. Returning to a ward where they had found it hard toparticipate as juniors, senior respondents found theywere now welcome because they were useful (3c.3). 3d Interaction with peers Depending on their individual personalities and the climate of the peer group, respondents could bespurred into active participation or rendered
the climate of the peer group, respondents could bespurred into active participation or rendered passiveby peer interaction (3d.1). Greater numbers ofstudents on ﬁrms and shorter, more discontinuous attachments reduced participation by making respondents’ interaction with doctors less personal(3d.2, 3d.3).3e Organisational factors A well structured curriculum with a clear timetable, deﬁned learning objectives, and space in the hospital they could call their own (3e.1) helped respondents participate, particularly when they were most juniorand vulnerable. 4 Students’ states of mindParticipation was inﬂuenced by, and inﬂuenced, respondents’ emotions, which reached their highest peaks and lowest troughs in the earlier years of the curriculum (4.1). 4a Building a sense of identityJunior respondents grappled with whether they had any right to be in the workplace (4a.1). Simple thingslike making tea for a friendly registrar (4a.2) or having a safe haven where they could write up notes (3e.1) helped. Being in workplaces where studentswere /C212new and exciting /C213increased their sense of identity (4a.3). However, they more often felt like/C212spare wheels /C213, or like unskilled, anonymous members of large groups who got underfoot (4a.4) and had noresponsibilities (4a.5). A junior respondent describedfeeling stigmatised by ward nurses as /C212the lowest of the low /C213(4a.6). Students could, however, develop an identity as a /C212member of the team /C213when they interacted on a one-to-one basis with doctors andnurses continuously over a period of time andcontributed to patient care (3d.3, 4a.7), all of whichbecame easier as they became more senior. Simply tobe addressed by name boosted their sense of identity(4a.8). 4b Becoming more conﬁdent Participation made respondents more conﬁdent (4b.1). Some were naturally self-conﬁdent (4b.2) andfound it easier to be conﬁdent if they were clearabout what they were expected to learn, but theirconﬁdence was very sensitive to how
they were clearabout what they were expected to learn, but theirconﬁdence was very sensitive to how doctors behaved towards them. Lack of conﬁdence made it hard for junior students to communicate with doctors,although doing so made their learning more partic-ipative (4b.3). Conﬁdence was dented by failedperformance and bolstered by positive feedback froma practitioner (4b.4). 4c Sustaining motivation Respondents’ motivation was strongly inﬂuenced by their workplace experiences. They were demotivated87 /C211Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007. MEDICAL EDUCATION 2007; 41: 84–91  13652923, 2007, 1, Downloaded from https://asmepublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02652.x by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [08/10/2024].

by practitioners refusing to interact with them (3b.1.1), keeping them as passive observers (2a.1), orhaving low expectations of them (4c.1). By contrast,doctors’ and nurses’ enthusiasm (4c.2), accessibility, and supportively challenging behaviour (3b.1.8) were powerful motivators. 4d Feeling rewardedRespondents were rewarded by achieving a relatively high level of participation for their stage of training(4d.1) particularly when they adopted the role of doctor (2b.1, 3b.1.6). Their feeling of low status could be counteracted by a doctor’s recognition,which made hard work worthwhile (3a.1, 4d.2),strengthened their sense of vocation for medicineand motivated them (4d.3). Teaching more juniorstudents on behalf of a doctor was particularlyrewarding. 5 Students’ competences 5a Study skillsRespondents spoke articulately about how their study skills had evolved: how they had learned what tolearn; what activities to attend (5a.1); how to accessthose activities; how to behave in hostile and unfa- miliar workplaces; what expectations to have of doctors and nurses; how to manage time proactively(5a.2); how to balance time spent on book-learningagainst time in the workplace (5a.3), and how toidentify reﬂectively what they had learned (5a.4).They learned through their own and their peers’experiences (5a.5) how to /C212pitch in /C213(5a.6), although the support of doctors and nurses made it easier to do so (5a.7). 5b KnowledgeEntering workplaces made respondents lose conﬁd- ence in knowledge they had spent many yearsacquiring (5b.1) and required them to learn newways of learning (5b.2). Private study made them more conﬁdent to participate (5b.3) and participa- tion made their learning more tangible and in-creased their conﬁdence in it (5b.4). Doctors wereable to help them by asking questions relating theoryto practice (5b.5). 5c Clinical skills Respondents acquired clinical skills through acting (4b.1).

skills through acting (4b.1). Practitioners could help by /C212throwing them in at the deep end /C213(5c.1), training, supervising, givingfeedback, expecting them to achieve quotas of skills, and ensuring they had opportunities to do so (5c.2).Developing clinical skills built respondents’ levels ofconﬁdence and motivation and enhanced their sense of both reward and identity, which in turn made it easier to participate. DISCUSSION Principal ﬁndings Figure 1 assembles the ﬁndings into a model of /C212experience-based learning /C213. In addition to the knowledge and skills of medical practice, studentsneed to acquire conﬁdence and a sense of profes-sional identity and sustain their motivation. Those various learning outcomes are attained together in a complex amalgam. Attaining them reinforces thelearning process, and failing to acquire them weakensit. The educational climate and behaviour of indi-vidual practitioners – nurses as well as doctors – hasgreat power to enable or disable workplace partici-pation that brings students closer to their ultimategoal of helping patients. As they progress through the curriculum, the outcomes students achieve and the activities through which they achieve them becamecloser to those involved in the role of a practitioner.An effective workplace teacher is someone who cansimultaneously support students and challenge themin a way that builds practical competence and apositive state of mind. Strengths and weaknesses of the study One of the study’s strengths is the coherence of the model that results from subjecting the narratives tolengthy and detailed grounded theory analysis by adeliberately mixed team of researchers, teasing outinteractions between process and outcome andsystematically seeking coherence and incoherence in the data. A second strength is the potential for generalisability that results from asking students tonarrate experiences spanning hospital wards, outpa-tient clinics, primary care, and other settings. A
experiences spanning hospital wards, outpa-tient clinics, primary care, and other settings. A thirdstrength is the combination of observational researchwith experimental strengthening of students’experiences. Although the sample of narratives wassufﬁcient to achieve theoretical saturation, our stu- dents all came from 1 medical school and might not be representative of students elsewhere. For example,our curriculum was not vertically integrated whenthis research was carried out. The balance and timingof practical and emotional competences might havebeen different if participants had been exposed toworkplace learning 88 /C211Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

early practical experience,15and the applicability of our ﬁndings to a traditional curriculum cannot betaken for granted. Our model assumes that students, as in Manchester, enter the clinical workplace having had basic training in a clinical skills laboratory. Although our synthesis is novel, it is consistent with previous research into clinical teaching and learn-ing, which is spread across a large number ofpublications reviewed elsewhere. 8That students quickly become bored if they remain as passive observers for too long has been described,16,17as has the fact that the more actively they are involvedand the closer their involvement comes to caringfor patients, the more highly they value it. 18–21 Students’ discomfort at the harm they and theirteachers can do to patients creates a tensionbetween their feelings of empathy and the need toacculturate to their new professional identity. 22,23 The highs of forming collegial relationships withpractitioners and their clinical teams in a /C212teach- ing)learning alliance /C213and the lows of being taught by humiliation are well documented, although thedominant place of nurses in students’ workplaceexperiences has received less attention. 19)21,24 According to a /C212relational /C213model of education, the teacher )learner relationship is important in just the same way as the doctor )patient relationship, and teachers can use it to good effect if theycouple challenge with support.25The emotionally charged nature of clinical learning is well reported,particularly in relation to stress at times of trans- ition. The constructive place of positive emotions 26 is now receiving more attention, particularly in research into the effect of educational climate.27–29 Meaning of the study Our ﬁndings ﬁt well with contemporary social theories of learning, according to which expertise is not simply a property that passes from teacher to learner, but a dynamic commodity that resideswithin communities of practice; learning, accordingto
learner, but a dynamic commodity that resideswithin communities of practice; learning, accordingto the theory, is a process of absorbing and beingabsorbed into the culture of such a community. 30–33 Developing a professional identity is so fundamen-tal to the process of becoming a doctor 34that having to be credible in the eyes of practitioners causes young medical students more stress than encountering illness and death.35Stress levels peak when students ﬁrst start learning in workplacesbecause they become acutely aware of their ownincompetence and unimportance beside the prac-titioners they strive to emulate. 36–39They feel discomfort as they /C212try on /C213new professional identi- ties that ﬁt more or less well.36Their individuality can ﬁnd expression through seeking out practi- tioner role models, developing relationships withMedical studentDoctor Curriculum  factors Clear objectives Continuity A favourable  student:staff ratioHuman interactions Patients Doctors Nurses Peers Practical competence Study skills Applied and tacit  knowledge Clinical skills EGATS FO NOITACUDEA positive  state of mind Sense of identity Confidence Motivation Sense of rewardSUPPORTED  PARTICIPATION  AS: Passive observer Active observer Actor in rehearsal Actor in performanceChallenge coupled with support  CONTEXT PROCESS OUTCOME Figure 1 Progression from medical student to doctor through participation in practice: an experience-based learning model of how a medical student becomes a doctor. The model considers the context, process and outcome of clinical workplacelearning. The central condition for learning is supported participation in practice to a level that is appropriate to the student’s stage of education. By participating, learners develop competences and an appropriate state of mind. Greater competence leads to a more positive state of mind and vice versa. Developing competence and a positive state of mind makes it easier forlearners to participate, but the ability to
and a positive state of mind makes it easier forlearners to participate, but the ability to participate is strongly modulated by the behaviour of people the learner meets in the workplace, whether their experience is diluted by being part of a large group, and whether what they should learn is made clear. The cycle can be virtuous (learning begets learning) or vicious.89 /C211Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

them, and negotiating the right to participate in their practice.19,40Thus, relationships between practitioners and learners can both facilitate learn-ing and generate high emotions. Learning medi- cine as a process of social enculturation has been very thoroughly explored in the important partici-pant)observer research of Sinclair, 41albeit in a more traditional system of teaching and learningthan ours. Unanswered questions and future research We suggest research to explore how curricula can more explicitly acknowledge the emotional dimen-sion of workplace learning and help learners andteachers learn reﬂectively from the signiﬁcantevents that arise there. Curriculum leaders andindividual teachers need to identify ways of helpingstudents participate in workplace activities appro-priate to their stage of training. /C212Task-based learn- ing /C213is such a pedagogy, whose place in contemporary medical education needs to be morethoroughly explored. 42As the education of doctors, nurses, and allied professionals responds to con-ﬂicting pressures to make graduates more ﬁt forpractice, strengthen the academic content of curri-cula, increase the output of health professionals,and treat large numbers of patients, 43studies comparing the basic education of different health professionals would be informative. The contribu-tion of trained nurses to the climate of basicmedical education also seems to need furtherinvestigation. The model depicted in Fig. 1 needs tobe turned into an instructional method, taught tolearners and practitioners, ﬁeld-tested, and evalu-ated. Finally, as argued in a recent review, /C212the compelling, but, to date, merely intuitive, model of progressive independence in training /C213on which clinical education has been based for the lastcentury needs to be subjected to good empiricalresearch if it is not /C212to be lost in an unreﬂective attempt to ensure efﬁcient health care, quality ofcare and patient safety in the short term /C213. 44 Contributors:

Experience-based learning: a model linking the processes and outcomes of medical students’workplace learning Tim Dornan,1Henny Boshuizen,2Nigel King3& Albert Scherpbier4 OBJECTIVE To develop a model linking the proces- ses and outcomes of workplace learning. METHODS We synthesised a model from grounded theory analysis of group discussions before and afterexperimental strengthening of medical students’workplace learning. The research was conductedwithin a problem-based clinical curriculum with littleearly workplace experience, involving 24 junior and12 senior medical students. RESULTS To reach their ultimate goal of helping patients, medical students must develop 2 qualities.One is practical competence; the other is a state ofmind that includes conﬁdence, motivation and asense of professional identity. These 2 qualities rein-force one another. The core process of clinicalworkplace learning involves /C212participation in prac- tice /C213, which evolves along a spectrum from passive observation to performance. Practitioners helpstudents participate by being both supportive andchallenging. The presentation of clear learningobjectives and continuous periods of attachment thatare as personal to the student(s) and practitioner(s)as possible promote workplace learning. CONCLUSIONS The core condition for clinical workplace learning is /C212supported participation /C213, the various outcomes of which are mutually reinforcingand also reinforce students’ ability to participate infurther practice. This synthesis has 2 important implications for contemporary medical education: any reduction in medical students’ participation in clinical practice that results from the patient safetyagenda and expanded numbers of medical studentsis likely to have an adverse effect on learning, and theconstruct of /C212self-directed learning /C213, which our respondents too often found synonymous with /C212lack of support /C213, should be applied with very great caution to medical students’ learning

Today’s students learn practically relevant theory in seminar rooms using well theorised methods1sup- ported by empirical evidence of effectiveness.2They learn skills through high-ﬁdelity simulation.3How- ever, they integrate their knowledge and skills inworkplaces through a process for which there are nobetter descriptors than /C212senior surgery /C213,/C212clinical teaching /C213,o r /C212primary care placements /C213. The work- place is where competence has eventually to be applied; it is the /C212theatre /C213for much of a doctor’s undergraduate and postgraduate education; work-place education is self-evidently important. However,the published literature mostly pertains to speciﬁccontexts (hospital ﬁrms, 4community settings,5 ambulatory education,6day surgery units7) and failsworkplace learning 1Hope Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK 2Open University of the Netherlands, Heerlen, The Netherlands 3Department of Psychology, University of Huddersﬁeld, Huddersﬁeld, UK 4Department of Educational Development and Research, University of Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands Correspondence : Dr Tim Dornan, Hope Hospital, Stott Lane, Salford, Manchester M6 8HD, UK.

to identify causal links between the processes and outcomes that are expected of a contemporary,integrated curriculum. We have synthesised students’narratives of how they learn in workplaces with adetailed literature review presented elsewhere 8into a testable model of workplace learning. METHODS Context The context was the Salford Sector of the University of Manchester Medical School. The curriculum is of a contemporary type with a spiral, fully horizontallyintegrated design that uses problem-based learning(PBL) methods through all 5 years. After limitedclinical exposure in Years 1 and 2, students continuethematic learning in Years 3 and 4, but now withclinical skills training and simultaneous communityand hospital attachments to provide access to a breadth of clinical problems and contexts. 9In Year 5, they have one-to-one attachments to clinicians andcontinue to attend group tutorials, but now use realpatients as triggers for PBL. 10Study design Students at the end of Year 3 were chosen as index respondents because they have had nearly a year’s clinical experience but are still junior. A tutorial group of 8 students on a 7-week attachment to 1 ﬁrm took partin a semistructured group discussion. Following theinterview template used in a previous survey of staff, 11 they discussed how successfully they had learned fromclinical experience, what factors had helped or hin-dered their learning, ways by which their learningmight have been improved, and the roles of their teachers. A provisional analysis of their narratives provided the starting point for a /C212complex interven- tion /C213, 12which included more comprehensive brieﬁng, mentoring, and reﬂective debrieﬁng on experience asdescribed in detail elsewhere. 13All 8 clinically naı ¨ve students non-purposively allocated to the ﬁrm at thestart of the next academic year gave informed, verbalconsent to take part in a group discussion after experiencing the modiﬁed ﬁrm for 7 weeks.

a group discussion after experiencing the modiﬁed ﬁrm for 7 weeks. To triangulate and extend those observations, a group of 9Year 5 students and a mixed group of 3 Year 5 and 8Year 3 students who had spent 20% of their time inprimary care and experienced a variety of hospitalsgave a senior student retrospect and compared seniorand junior student perspectives on clinical learning. Roles of the researchers Having become experienced as a /C212participant obser- ver /C213, 11,13the ﬁrst author conducted the index discus- sion and complex intervention with students attachedto the ﬁrm on which he was 1 of 5 consultants. He keptdaily ﬁeld notes and students kept daily written recordsof their learning. His co-researchers helped him identify preconceptions and biases that might colour his interpretation, 11supervised the study to identify bias in its conduct, and compared his evolving inter-pretation against the original narratives. A secondauthor and a clinical academic (not an author)observed the discussion with intervention groupstudents to identify undue inﬂuence on their opinions.Unlike the Year 3 students, who were all taught by the ﬁrst author, few of the Year 5 students had been placed with him and some had never met him. A third author,who never met the students, supervised the study. Afourth author, naı ¨ve to the conduct of the study, critiqued a provisional interpretation against theoriginal transcripts. Analytical methods Each discussion was analysed in enough detail to inform the next, but the grounded theory analysis wasOverview What is already known on this subject Descriptions of clinical workplace learning are usually tied to specific contexts and disciplinesin which it is delivered ( /C212firms /C213,/C212paediatrics /C213, /C212ambulatory care education /C213) and concentrate more on teaching ( /C212clinical teaching /C213) than learning.

RESULTS 1 Participation as the core condition for learning Despite their exposure to primary care, respondents spoke mostly about hospital experiences (1.1). Theylearned best by participating in practice but theirworkplace experiences were not all participative. Asthey became more senior, learning activities had tobe close to the role of a practitioner to be experi- enced as participative. 2 The nature of participation2a Observation as participationObservation could be active or passive. Passive observation allowed respondents to glean knowledge and encounter realities they had learned about in theory but which gave, at best, a transient sense ofparticipation. Interaction with doctors and nursesmade observation a more participative and instructiveexperience and respondents became frustrated whenthat interaction was lacking.

whenthat interaction was lacking. (2a.1). 2b /C212Acting /C213as participation Performing clinical tasks made students participants by changing them from the status of observers to thatof actors (2b.1). However, even acting could be moreor less participative. Clerking a patient who hadalready been clerked by a doctor was rehearsal (2b.2).An act became performance and a respondent’s sense of participation increased when the task con-tributed to patient care (2b.3). There were, of course,some tasks that had to be rehearsed before respond- ents could perform them but there were others, such as calling a patient into a consulting room orcompleting a request form (2b.4), that could giveeven junior students a sense of participation. 3 Factors affecting participation3a Interaction with patients The wish to beneﬁt patients had led many respond- ents to study medicine (3a.1) but their early attemptsto participate were hampered by fear of doing just theopposite (3a.2). Doctors made participation easier byintroducing respondents to patients as /C212doctors-to-be /C213 and recognising the quality of their early rehearsals(3a.1). Building social relationships with patients increased inexperienced respondents’ sense of par- ticipation (3a.3) and success gave them more con-ﬁdence to participate on another occasion. Beingtaken to the bedside in a large group, by contrast,could be a very negative experience of non-partici-pation because respondents were not just observingpassively but invading a patient’s privacy. (3a.4). 3b Interaction with doctors 3b.1 Doctors’ behaviour towards studentsSome doctors showed their unwillingness to support participation by failing to greet respondents whenthey arrived, providing no timetable, cancellingteaching, failing to turn up, or allowing themselves to be bleeped away (3b.1.1). Others actively supported participation by providing ready access to theirpractice (3b.1.2), sharing their clinical expertise(3b.1.3), and creating tasks for respondents
(3b.1.2), sharing their clinical expertise(3b.1.3), and creating tasks for respondents toperform (3b.1.4). The pressures of practice ampliﬁeddoctors’ (un)willingness to support student partici-pation, with some becoming unfriendly and relega-ting students to the role of passive observers (3b.1.5), and others asking them to help out (3b.1.6). There was a dynamic between doctor and respondent suchthat students who were clear what they wanted tolearn, unafraid to ask questions and practicallycompetent had the best chance of participating(3b.1.7). Challenging respondents with a question ortask increased their participation provided the chal-lenge was appropriate to their level of experience and made in a supportive way (3b.1.8). Teachers could strike the right balance between support and demandby amicably /C212grilling /C213respondents (3b.1.9) and theworkplace learning 86 /C211Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

wrong balance by asking questions in a belittling way or using a respondent as a menial pair of hands(3b.1.10). 3b.2 The climate of the medical team The personalities of doctors had a pervasive inﬂu- ence on the learning climate of a ﬁrm. Some seniorshelped respondents participate by increasing theirjuniors’ interest in teaching (3b.2.1), whereas othersleft their juniors unsupported, unaccountable andunrewarded (3b.2.2). 3b.3 Doctors’ knowledge of the curriculum Doctors’ familiarity with the curriculum also affected respondents’ participation. A common obstacle toparticipation was the misconception that teachersshould not divulge answers or share their expertise ina PBL curriculum (3b.3.1). 3c Interaction with nurses Nurses had a powerful inﬂuence for good or ill on respondents’ participation (3c.1) They could leaverespondents feeling passive, unskilled and unconﬁ-dent by claiming they had arrived unannounced.Sometimes they even denied respondents access to the workplace. At the other extreme, they could be welcoming, supportive, willing to share their expertise,and able to offset the /C212scariness /C213of doctors (3c.2). Respondents’ experiences with nurses were morepositive in outpatient than ward settings, in districtthan teaching hospitals, with specialist rather thangeneralist nurses, and as senior rather than juniormedical students. Respondents contrasted their situ- ation unfavourably with that of student nurses, who wore uniforms, had one-to-one relationships withtrained nurses, had their own patients, had deﬁnedresponsibilities, were a useful part of the workforce,and /C212were training to be nurses rather than pass exams /C213. Returning to a ward where they had found it hard toparticipate as juniors, senior respondents found theywere now welcome because they were useful (3c.3). 3d Interaction with peers Depending on their individual personalities and the climate of the peer group, respondents could bespurred into active participation or rendered
the climate of the peer group, respondents could bespurred into active participation or rendered passiveby peer interaction (3d.1). Greater numbers ofstudents on ﬁrms and shorter, more discontinuous attachments reduced participation by making respondents’ interaction with doctors less personal(3d.2, 3d.3).3e Organisational factors A well structured curriculum with a clear timetable, deﬁned learning objectives, and space in the hospital they could call their own (3e.1) helped respondents participate, particularly when they were most juniorand vulnerable. 4 Students’ states of mindParticipation was inﬂuenced by, and inﬂuenced, respondents’ emotions, which reached their highest peaks and lowest troughs in the earlier years of the curriculum (4.1). 4a Building a sense of identityJunior respondents grappled with whether they had any right to be in the workplace (4a.1). Simple thingslike making tea for a friendly registrar (4a.2) or having a safe haven where they could write up notes (3e.1) helped. Being in workplaces where studentswere /C212new and exciting /C213increased their sense of identity (4a.3). However, they more often felt like/C212spare wheels /C213, or like unskilled, anonymous members of large groups who got underfoot (4a.4) and had noresponsibilities (4a.5). A junior respondent describedfeeling stigmatised by ward nurses as /C212the lowest of the low /C213(4a.6). Students could, however, develop an identity as a /C212member of the team /C213when they interacted on a one-to-one basis with doctors andnurses continuously over a period of time andcontributed to patient care (3d.3, 4a.7), all of whichbecame easier as they became more senior. Simply tobe addressed by name boosted their sense of identity(4a.8). 4b Becoming more conﬁdent Participation made respondents more conﬁdent (4b.1). Some were naturally self-conﬁdent (4b.2) andfound it easier to be conﬁdent if they were clearabout what they were expected to learn, but theirconﬁdence was very sensitive to how
they were clearabout what they were expected to learn, but theirconﬁdence was very sensitive to how doctors behaved towards them. Lack of conﬁdence made it hard for junior students to communicate with doctors,although doing so made their learning more partic-ipative (4b.3). Conﬁdence was dented by failedperformance and bolstered by positive feedback froma practitioner (4b.4). 4c Sustaining motivation Respondents’ motivation was strongly inﬂuenced by their workplace experiences. They were demotivated87 /C211Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007. MEDICAL EDUCATION 2007; 41: 84–91  13652923, 2007, 1, Downloaded from https://asmepublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02652.x by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [08/10/2024].

by practitioners refusing to interact with them (3b.1.1), keeping them as passive observers (2a.1), orhaving low expectations of them (4c.1). By contrast,doctors’ and nurses’ enthusiasm (4c.2), accessibility, and supportively challenging behaviour (3b.1.8) were powerful motivators. 4d Feeling rewardedRespondents were rewarded by achieving a relatively high level of participation for their stage of training(4d.1) particularly when they adopted the role of doctor (2b.1, 3b.1.6). Their feeling of low status could be counteracted by a doctor’s recognition,which made hard work worthwhile (3a.1, 4d.2),strengthened their sense of vocation for medicineand motivated them (4d.3). Teaching more juniorstudents on behalf of a doctor was particularlyrewarding. 5 Students’ competences 5a Study skillsRespondents spoke articulately about how their study skills had evolved: how they had learned what tolearn; what activities to attend (5a.1); how to accessthose activities; how to behave in hostile and unfa- miliar workplaces; what expectations to have of doctors and nurses; how to manage time proactively(5a.2); how to balance time spent on book-learningagainst time in the workplace (5a.3), and how toidentify reﬂectively what they had learned (5a.4).They learned through their own and their peers’experiences (5a.5) how to /C212pitch in /C213(5a.6), although the support of doctors and nurses made it easier to do so (5a.7). 5b KnowledgeEntering workplaces made respondents lose conﬁd- ence in knowledge they had spent many yearsacquiring (5b.1) and required them to learn newways of learning (5b.2). Private study made them more conﬁdent to participate (5b.3) and participa- tion made their learning more tangible and in-creased their conﬁdence in it (5b.4). Doctors wereable to help them by asking questions relating theoryto practice (5b.5). 5c Clinical skills Respondents acquired clinical skills through acting (4b.1).

skills through acting (4b.1). Practitioners could help by /C212throwing them in at the deep end /C213(5c.1), training, supervising, givingfeedback, expecting them to achieve quotas of skills, and ensuring they had opportunities to do so (5c.2).Developing clinical skills built respondents’ levels ofconﬁdence and motivation and enhanced their sense of both reward and identity, which in turn made it easier to participate. DISCUSSION Principal ﬁndings Figure 1 assembles the ﬁndings into a model of /C212experience-based learning /C213. In addition to the knowledge and skills of medical practice, studentsneed to acquire conﬁdence and a sense of profes-sional identity and sustain their motivation. Those various learning outcomes are attained together in a complex amalgam. Attaining them reinforces thelearning process, and failing to acquire them weakensit. The educational climate and behaviour of indi-vidual practitioners – nurses as well as doctors – hasgreat power to enable or disable workplace partici-pation that brings students closer to their ultimategoal of helping patients. As they progress through the curriculum, the outcomes students achieve and the activities through which they achieve them becamecloser to those involved in the role of a practitioner.An effective workplace teacher is someone who cansimultaneously support students and challenge themin a way that builds practical competence and apositive state of mind. Strengths and weaknesses of the study One of the study’s strengths is the coherence of the model that results from subjecting the narratives tolengthy and detailed grounded theory analysis by adeliberately mixed team of researchers, teasing outinteractions between process and outcome andsystematically seeking coherence and incoherence in the data. A second strength is the potential for generalisability that results from asking students tonarrate experiences spanning hospital wards, outpa-tient clinics, primary care, and other settings. A
experiences spanning hospital wards, outpa-tient clinics, primary care, and other settings. A thirdstrength is the combination of observational researchwith experimental strengthening of students’experiences. Although the sample of narratives wassufﬁcient to achieve theoretical saturation, our stu- dents all came from 1 medical school and might not be representative of students elsewhere. For example,our curriculum was not vertically integrated whenthis research was carried out. The balance and timingof practical and emotional competences might havebeen different if participants had been exposed toworkplace learning 88 /C211Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

early practical experience,15and the applicability of our ﬁndings to a traditional curriculum cannot betaken for granted. Our model assumes that students, as in Manchester, enter the clinical workplace having had basic training in a clinical skills laboratory. Although our synthesis is novel, it is consistent with previous research into clinical teaching and learn-ing, which is spread across a large number ofpublications reviewed elsewhere. 8That students quickly become bored if they remain as passive observers for too long has been described,16,17as has the fact that the more actively they are involvedand the closer their involvement comes to caringfor patients, the more highly they value it. 18–21 Students’ discomfort at the harm they and theirteachers can do to patients creates a tensionbetween their feelings of empathy and the need toacculturate to their new professional identity. 22,23 The highs of forming collegial relationships withpractitioners and their clinical teams in a /C212teach- ing)learning alliance /C213and the lows of being taught by humiliation are well documented, although thedominant place of nurses in students’ workplaceexperiences has received less attention. 19)21,24 According to a /C212relational /C213model of education, the teacher )learner relationship is important in just the same way as the doctor )patient relationship, and teachers can use it to good effect if theycouple challenge with support.25The emotionally charged nature of clinical learning is well reported,particularly in relation to stress at times of trans- ition. The constructive place of positive emotions 26 is now receiving more attention, particularly in research into the effect of educational climate.27–29 Meaning of the study Our ﬁndings ﬁt well with contemporary social theories of learning, according to which expertise is not simply a property that passes from teacher to learner, but a dynamic commodity that resideswithin communities of practice; learning, accordingto
learner, but a dynamic commodity that resideswithin communities of practice; learning, accordingto the theory, is a process of absorbing and beingabsorbed into the culture of such a community. 30–33 Developing a professional identity is so fundamen-tal to the process of becoming a doctor 34that having to be credible in the eyes of practitioners causes young medical students more stress than encountering illness and death.35Stress levels peak when students ﬁrst start learning in workplacesbecause they become acutely aware of their ownincompetence and unimportance beside the prac-titioners they strive to emulate. 36–39They feel discomfort as they /C212try on /C213new professional identi- ties that ﬁt more or less well.36Their individuality can ﬁnd expression through seeking out practi- tioner role models, developing relationships withMedical studentDoctor Curriculum  factors Clear objectives Continuity A favourable  student:staff ratioHuman interactions Patients Doctors Nurses Peers Practical competence Study skills Applied and tacit  knowledge Clinical skills EGATS FO NOITACUDEA positive  state of mind Sense of identity Confidence Motivation Sense of rewardSUPPORTED  PARTICIPATION  AS: Passive observer Active observer Actor in rehearsal Actor in performanceChallenge coupled with support  CONTEXT PROCESS OUTCOME Figure 1 Progression from medical student to doctor through participation in practice: an experience-based learning model of how a medical student becomes a doctor. The model considers the context, process and outcome of clinical workplacelearning. The central condition for learning is supported participation in practice to a level that is appropriate to the student’s stage of education. By participating, learners develop competences and an appropriate state of mind. Greater competence leads to a more positive state of mind and vice versa. Developing competence and a positive state of mind makes it easier forlearners to participate, but the ability to
and a positive state of mind makes it easier forlearners to participate, but the ability to participate is strongly modulated by the behaviour of people the learner meets in the workplace, whether their experience is diluted by being part of a large group, and whether what they should learn is made clear. The cycle can be virtuous (learning begets learning) or vicious.89 /C211Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

them, and negotiating the right to participate in their practice.19,40Thus, relationships between practitioners and learners can both facilitate learn-ing and generate high emotions. Learning medi- cine as a process of social enculturation has been very thoroughly explored in the important partici-pant)observer research of Sinclair, 41albeit in a more traditional system of teaching and learningthan ours. Unanswered questions and future research We suggest research to explore how curricula can more explicitly acknowledge the emotional dimen-sion of workplace learning and help learners andteachers learn reﬂectively from the signiﬁcantevents that arise there. Curriculum leaders andindividual teachers need to identify ways of helpingstudents participate in workplace activities appro-priate to their stage of training. /C212Task-based learn- ing /C213is such a pedagogy, whose place in contemporary medical education needs to be morethoroughly explored. 42As the education of doctors, nurses, and allied professionals responds to con-ﬂicting pressures to make graduates more ﬁt forpractice, strengthen the academic content of curri-cula, increase the output of health professionals,and treat large numbers of patients, 43studies comparing the basic education of different health professionals would be informative. The contribu-tion of trained nurses to the climate of basicmedical education also seems to need furtherinvestigation. The model depicted in Fig. 1 needs tobe turned into an instructional method, taught tolearners and practitioners, ﬁeld-tested, and evalu-ated. Finally, as argued in a recent review, /C212the compelling, but, to date, merely intuitive, model of progressive independence in training /C213on which clinical education has been based for the lastcentury needs to be subjected to good empiricalresearch if it is not /C212to be lost in an unreﬂective attempt to ensure efﬁcient health care, quality ofcare and patient safety in the short term /C213. 44 Contributors:

El artículo "Experience-based learning: a model linking the processes and outcomes of medical students’ workplace learning" de Tim Dornan y colaboradores se centra en desarrollar un modelo que conecte los procesos y resultados del aprendizaje en el lugar de trabajo para estudiantes de medicina. La investigación se realizó en un contexto de currículo clínico basado en problemas, con la participación de 24 estudiantes de medicina junior y 12 senior, quienes tenían limitada experiencia laboral previa.

### Métodos
Se utilizó un análisis de teoría fundamentada, basado en discusiones grupales antes y después de una intervención experimental que fortaleció el aprendizaje en el lugar de trabajo. Este enfoque permitió identificar y sintetizar un modelo que refleja las dinámicas del aprendizaje práctico en entornos clínicos.

### Resultados
Los hallazgos indican que para que los estudiantes logren su objetivo de ayudar a los pacientes, deben desarrollar dos cualidades esenciales: competencia práctica y un estado mental que incluya confianza, motivación y un sentido de identidad profesional. Estas cualidades se refuerzan mutuamente. El aprendizaje en el lugar de trabajo clínico se centra en la participación activa, que varía desde la observación pasiva hasta la ejecución activa. Los profesionales de la salud son fundamentales en este proceso, actuando como apoyo y desafío para los estudiantes. La claridad en los objetivos de aprendizaje y la creación de vínculos personales continuos entre estudiantes y profesionales son factores que promueven un aprendizaje efectivo.

### Conclusiones
La "participación apoyada" es la condición central para el aprendizaje en el lugar de trabajo clínico, y sus resultados son mutuamente reforzantes, fortaleciendo la capacidad de los estudiantes para participar en prácticas futuras. Se destacan dos implicaciones para la educación médica contemporánea: cualquier reducción en la participación de los estudiantes en la práctica clínica puede afectar negativamente su aprendizaje, y el concepto de "aprendizaje autodirigido" debe aplicarse con precaución, ya que a menudo se asocia con falta de apoyo.

El estudio subraya la importancia de la participación activa y el apoyo en el aprendizaje clínico, sugiriendo que la calidad de la experiencia de aprendizaje en el lugar de trabajo es crucial para el desarrollo de competencias y la identidad profesional de los futuros médicos. Se critica que la enseñanza de la medicina no ha evolucionado al mismo ritmo que los cambios en la educación superior, y se enfatiza la necesidad de mejorar la formación en competencias clínicas y relaciones interprofesionales.

### Contexto del Estudio
El estudio se llevó a cabo en la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Manchester, en un currículo contemporáneo que utiliza métodos de aprendizaje basado en problemas (PBL). La estructura del aprendizaje incluye una exposición clínica limitada en los primeros años, seguida de un aprendizaje temático y adjuntos clínicos en años posteriores.

### Diseño del Estudio
Los participantes fueron estudiantes al final del Año 3, quienes ya tenían experiencia clínica. Se realizaron discusiones grupales semiestructuradas durante un adjunto de 7 semanas, donde los estudiantes compartieron sus experiencias de aprendizaje y los factores que facilitaron o dificultaron su proceso.

### Análisis y Resultados
Las narrativas de los estudiantes se analizaron para desarrollar una intervención compleja que incluyó briefing, mentoría y debriefing reflexivo. El objetivo principal fue crear un modelo de aprendizaje en el lugar de trabajo que integre las narrativas de los estudiantes con la literatura existente.

### Contribuciones del Estudio
El estudio reconoce tanto el aprendizaje emocional como el práctico, ampliando la comprensión del aprendizaje clínico. Se presenta un modelo que vincula el proceso de aprendizaje con los resultados obtenidos, sugiriendo direcciones para futuras investigaciones.

### Fortalezas y Debilidades
El modelo resultante se basa en un análisis detallado de las narrativas de los estudiantes, realizado por un equipo diverso. Sin embargo, la representatividad de los hallazgos puede estar limitada, ya que todos los participantes provenían de una única escuela de medicina.

### Implicaciones para la Educación Médica
El texto concluye que el aprendizaje en el lugar de trabajo debe ser considerado un proceso dinámico que involucra la interacción entre estudiantes y profesionales, y que la calidad de estas interacciones influye en el desarrollo de competencias y la identidad profesional de los estudiantes. Se sugiere que la educación médica debe adaptarse a las realidades del aprendizaje en entornos clínicos para preparar mejor a los futuros médicos.

### Referencias
El artículo incluye una serie de referencias que abordan diversos aspectos de la educación médica, desde el aprendizaje basado en problemas hasta la experiencia clínica, proporcionando un marco teórico sólido para la investigación presentada. 

En resumen, el estudio de Dornan y colaboradores destaca la importancia de la participación activa y el apoyo en el aprendizaje clínico, sugiriendo que la calidad de la experiencia de aprendizaje en el lugar de trabajo es crucial para el desarrollo de competencias y la identidad profesional de los futuros médicos.
