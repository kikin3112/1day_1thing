However, learning methodologies used by professors seem to be detached from reality, preventing the development of applicable learning, as well as the acquisition of those skills necessary in the twenty-first century. The main objective of the research is to analyze the Lean Startup method as a learning methodology in the creation of digital and research competencies in students from the UNED Costa Rica during the development of the course: Mixed Methods Research (MMR). The sample consisted of 531 individuals, teachers and students from different degrees of the School of Education from the UNED who took the course during the years 2015 to 2017. A mixed explanatory sequential design was used, with a theoretical part of an exploration of the method, a quantitative part (descriptive analysis and contrast of means) and another qualitative part by means of content analysis. The results showed the effectiveness of an
another qualitative part by means of content analysis. The results showed the effectiveness of an innovative methodology such as Lean Startup in the development of digital and research skills, and the change of the teacher’s role in the teaching process.

However, certain authors in their research, such as Cajide et al. (2002),Voogt and Roblin (2012), Clemente and Escribá (2013) have pointed out the need for universities to be more linked to the requirements of companies as well as to the needs and demands of society, taking into account the daily reality which is where the different skills and abilities acquired during the years of study How to cite this article (APA): Ávalos, C., Pérez-Escoda, A., & Monge, L.

Carolina, Ávalos; et al. Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies are put to test. In this way, the other conglomerate of capacities, abilities and skills for the integral development of the professional can start to be considered in the processes of professional training. From research carried out on the subject ever since the beginning of the 21st cen- tury (OCDE, 2005; OECD, 2018; Rychen & Salganik, 2000) we can find an international concern towards the appropriate skills that the education system must provide for citizens to face the challenges of the new century. Skills such as learning to innovate, digital and office literacy, improving people’s personal and professional life, as well as axiological and ethical training, are some of those that stand out in the current century. Authors such asLuna(2015) and Figueroa (2017) coincide in the need to acquire skills such as those indicated which prepare citizens for current challenges and demands, thus highlighting the need to rethink the learning methodology towards roles and training spaces that are more participatory and applied to experiential contexts. In this sense, from different international contexts the appropriate skills for this century havebeendefined, fromdiversemodelsofdevelopmentarisingfromtheassociationofuni- versities such as Partnership for 21st Century (2009); from international organisms such asUNESCO (2008 2016) and OECD (2018), from the European Union ( Vuorikari, Punie, Carretero, & Brande, 2016) or from the national scope, in this case Costa Rica (Zúñiga, Núñez, Brenes, & Chacón, 2013). However, from the responsibility that universities must assume in providing solutions to the demands of society, Shank(2011) criticizes that, from the reality of the system, there is a decontextualized training of the needs of each population. That is to say a learning system which lacks meaning and in its absence, reproduces contents that are not significant for
system which lacks meaning and in its absence, reproduces contents that are not significant for the students in their training, and develops tough competition, instrumental abilities and skills without the necessary understanding to be adapted to real scenarios. As stated by Alabart (sf) (quoted in Borafull 2014), “the current educational system forces everyone to go through the tube of homogenization, not considering individual talents and instilling knowledge of a generic and non-significant character” (p. 156). According to the scenario presented and focusing on digital and research competen- cies, it can be assured that the student body in its training process receives instruction about the use of technological resources and knowledge mainly of bibliographic research processes (Campos & Chinchilla, 2009; Jou & Wang, 2013; López, 2013; Rectores, 2017), However, none of these inputs refer to the acquisition of digital and research competencies from an innate understanding, nor, to how the development of such skills allows students to transfer the knowledge acquired to other scenarios from intrinsic processes. 1. 1 Digital competencies Digital competency, as such, appears in the European Reference Framework in 2006 in recognition of the European Union of basic skills that every citizen of the 21st century should develop in order to be competent: Recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 18, 2006 on key competencies for lifelong learning. Although digital competency was recognized and defined as one of the 8 basic competen- Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research, 8(2) j2019 jhttps://doi.org/10.7821/naer.2019.7.438 228
Carolina, Ávalos; et al. Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies cies, it was not until 2013 ( Ferrari, 2013) that a well-founded definition was established: Digital competency is a set of knowledge, skills, attitudes, strategies, values and awareness required when using ICT and digital media to perform tasks, solve problems, communicate, manage information, collaborate, create and share con- tent and build knowledge in an effective, efficient, appropriate, critical, creative, autonomous, flexible, ethical and reflective way for work, leisure, participation, learning, socialization, consumption and empowerment (Ferrari, 2013, p. 4) This study takes the European Reference Framework as a theoretical base, in which the ref- erence framework and understanding of digital competency is developed in 2013 ( Ferrari, 2013)andrevisedin2016( Vuorikarietal.,2016). Followingthis, thefollowingdigitalcom- petencies have been identified for our study (Vuorikari et al., 2016) • Information management: related to effective searches, evaluation, storage and retrieval of information. • Communication: including all communicative actions carried out through ICT tools (social networks, blogs, chats, etc.). • Content creation: such as the ability to create all kinds of content (blogs, websites, wikis, presentations, infographics, etc.). • Problem solving: with a specific focus on critical thinking and problem solving cen- tered on technology and with the effective ability to find answers to questions posed. • Security: related to digital identity management, privacy, configuration of tools and profiles, etc. 1.2 Research competencies In 2010, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development established a series of research competencies to be developed in the twenty-first century, those that would pro- mote problem solving actions to solve problems for reflective thinking, ethical and social impact, communication, adaptability and
solve problems for reflective thinking, ethical and social impact, communication, adaptability and organization; such competencies will be consid- ered in the analysis of this research, since they have been reinforced thanks to studies con- ducted by Jou and Wang (2013),Davison and Palermo (2015), Luna(2015) and Anderson (2016), which have coincided with the approaches of the OECD. Currently one of the main concerns of the education system is the lack of research skills in the training of its professionals, as has been demonstrated in recent years, from statisti- cal reports such as the State of Education and studies developed in Costa Rican territory, highlighting the lack of research productions from this sector ( Ávalos, 2018). Taking into account the competency needs of the 21st century and considering the con- tributions of Riyanti, Sandroto, and DW (2017) , Borafull (2014),Luna(2015), and Gisbert and Lázaro (2015), on the skills that every professional must develop in this century, the search for emerging methods was carried out. This took place in those disciplines where successfulresultshadbeenidentifiedallowingforthedevelopmentofmetacognitionspaces, which were missing in the teacher training of UNED students. In this way, the Lean Startup Method became relevant to be applied as a learning methodology.

Carolina, Ávalos; et al. Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies 1.3 Lean Startup as a learning methodology The Lean Startup method was created by Erick Ries in 2011. According to Ries, the method enhancesthose”practicesthatfavorthecreationofStartupssuccessfullyandwithlittlelike- lihood of experiencing losses” (Ries, 2011, p. 39). It is based on the scientific method for its execution and considers a series of steps that are fundamental in its development: creating, measuring and learning. Authorssuchas Fishbein (2014),GutiérrezandApaolaza (2014),Ritika(2015)and Peñalver (2017) perceive a diversified implementation of the method from areas other than Business Administration, thereby promoting the development of a new learning methodology that favors processes such as: • The contextualization of knowledge: working with learning experiences with a real- istic approach, promoting an improvement of mindset and problem solving. • The development of entrepreneurial attitudes: by enhancing collaborative work, cre- ative mentality, effective communication, permanent observation, experimentation, analysis of situations, development of innovative proposals. All of which, together with technological resources can appropriate the student body with digital compe- tencyandfromdesignprocesses, withthemeasurementofproposals, theverification and socialization of results and the research competency. • The development of soft skills is encouraged: those that predispose students to adopt changes and adjust to them in a proactive way, to be empathetic, to know how to look for solutions to different situations, to develop divergent thinking, processes of self-motivation and thus flexible and innovative thinking. 2METHOD The study took place in three stages during the years 2015-2017, and included as a study population the student body of the School of Educational Sciences, who were taking the course Mixed Methods Research (MMR). Duringthe
School of Educational Sciences, who were taking the course Mixed Methods Research (MMR). Duringthe assessment stage, a documentary review was developed, as well as the imple- mentation of instruments to students and teachers, together with processes to improve the learning methodology. In the processual stage and final stage of research, the course was developed with the incorporation of the Lean Startup method as a learning methodology. ThisimpliedmakinguseoftechniquesandstrategiessuchasProjectBasedLearning(PBL), research seedbeds, collaborative work and mediating the development of conceptual and procedural knowledge of the subject through the use of tools such as: wiki, reflective jour- nals, academic forums, chat, Skype, WhatsApp and Google drive, all conducive to effective communication, self-regulationoflearning, teamwork, divergentthinkingandsolvingsitu- ations, conducive to learning for life ( Riyanti et al., 2017). These modifications were gener- ated in 2016 and implemented in 2017, with the objective of testing the effectiveness of the Lean Startup method as a learning methodology to guarantee building digital and research competencies in the student body of the subject Mixed Methods Research.

Carolina, Ávalos; et al. Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies The s tudy is framed within a descriptive, explanatory and applied research which has been developed in three stages: diagnostic, processual and final ( Pérez, 2006). It is an explanatory sequential mixed type ( Creswell, 2015), which seeks to respond to the phe- nomenon studied by contrasting qualitative and quantitative data ( Pérez, Galán, & Quin- tanal, 2012). 2. 1 Sample ThestudywascarriedoutwithstudentsfromdifferentdegreesoftheFacultyofEducational Sciences who were studying the course Mixed Methods Research during the years 2015 to 2017andprofessorswhoofferedthesubjectduringthoseyears. Inpractice,therewasatotal sample of 531 subjects of which 319 were women and 212 were men; the average age of the participants was between 30 to 50 years old. Sampling was carried out for the diagnostic and processual stage in a simple random probability with 95% reliability and a 5% margin of error, considering 116 students and 3 teachers in the diagnostic stage, 201 students in the processual stage who participated in the survey and a review of performance reports of 173 other students in the subject. The final stage was done in a non-probabilistic way for convenience, working with a group of 33 students and 5 teachers from the course ( Sáez, 2017). 2.2 Creation of the survey In the diagnostic and processual stage, two surveys were designed as data collection instru- ments with the intention of knowing the achievement of digital and research competencies reached by the students in the course. Each survey consisted of 5 parts: sociodemographic information, methodology used, methodological strategies, ICT resources used, research skills and abilities achieved at the end of the course; Likert scales were used in its deploy- ment. Also, interviews were conducted with teachers in the diagnostic stage. In the final stage, interviews were conducted with students and
teachers in the diagnostic stage. In the final stage, interviews were conducted with students and teachers, as well as observation pro- cesses using checklists. The validation of the surveys and interviews was carried out by experts in the areas of Technology, Pedagogy and Research prior to deploying them to the participating sample ( McMillan & Schumacher, 2005). The variables to be analyzed were: theacquisitionofdigitalandresearchcompetenciesasdependentvariablesandasindepen- dent variables: learning methodology, ICT resources and learning experiences. 2.3 Reliability of the survey For the quantitative part of the survey, the statistical package SPSS was used, highlighting a normal distribution in the behavior of the variables, the factorial analysis technique was used to determine the correlation of the variables; from the results of KMO and Bartlett tests, a high level of correlation between the factors 0.903 was shown, with a high signif- icance.

was first carried out to group the competencies, highlighting from the matrix of components a reduction of factors to two predominant components in the digital com- petency (CD): information management (.649) and problem solving using critical thinking (-.617). In the case of research competencies (IQ) one component was highlighted: com- munication (.701). Once the competency factors were identified, the correlation was made with the methodology used by the teaching staff, highlighting a significance in the digi- tal information management competency (CD 2, see Table 2) with regard to the other two competencies. The results in table 2 demonstrate a high significance that is changing in information management (CD2) in contrast with the methodology variables, with p < .05. This means that the (CD2) is going to increase or decrease according to the type of methodology devel- oped by the teaching staff in the subject. Problem solving (CD1) and communication com- petencies(CI)didnotachievethissignificancewhich,accordingtothedatapresented,seem to require another type of methodology that favors the development of these competencies in learning processes.

As a result, more than 50% of the research
of new knowledge construction processes ( Ávalos, 2018). As a result, more than 50% of the research competencies focused on information search and content analysis capacities, and in percentages lower than 50% other relevant competencies, such as: problem solving, critical and reflective thinking, ethical-social impact and communication, based on studies by Jou and Wang (2013), and OECD (2018). Among the digital competencies achieved according to the student body and in a percent- age greater than 50% were: a positive attitude towards the use of technological resources and the use of certain tools on the platform, leaving other competencies undeveloped with a percentage data below 40%. These included: communication and collaboration, the creation of digital content in problem solving, which have been supported in studies Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research, 8(2) j2019 jhttps://doi.org/10.7821/naer.2019.7.438 234

Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies LMS pl atform, identifying those that would be of greater benefit in the student’s analysis and reflection processes for the subject’s learning experiences and those which, in addition, would promote collaborative work. Therefore, the use of reflective journals and wiki were some of the tools incorporated into the learning experience, as well as others detailed in the previous table. The aim was to level the workload on the platform based on the observations made in previous periods (2016-1 and 2016-2), ensuring that the activities were interrelated, so that the group’s efforts to generate an electronic dictionary on research topics using the Wiki and individual reflections developed in reflective journals were contributions that assigned more weight to the knowledge of each student in the subject (MMR). This was done in order to generate their own research project approach and make an effective pedagogical use of technological tools that they had not used before, which allowed them to increase their knowledge and practice in the use of technology while developing research knowl- edge, encouraging also the use of other tools such as Skype, WhatsApp and Chat, and more accompaniment and motivation that was highlighted by the students in the SWOT’s ( Áva- los, 2018). As for the development of the subject improvements (MMR), prior to the changes it was necessary to develop a learning methodology, which is presented inFigure 3 with the Figur e 2Redesign of teaching strategies Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research, 8(2) j2019 jhttps://doi.org/10.7821/naer.2019.7.438 236
Carolina, Ávalos; et al. Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies implementation of the Lean Startup method as a learning methodology. By materializing the system that underpins the Lean Startup build-measure-learn methodology, it was possible for students to move from a methodology focused on instruc- tionallearningtoonebydoing. Inthisway,inthebuildingstagethestudentbodydeveloped activities that allowed them to reinforce observation, inquiry, analysis and reflection. They interacted constantly with different tools such as Wiki in collaborative learning spaces for the development of a digital dictionary on research topics, with the reflective diary in the development of weekly annotations, sensitizing their observations on the object of study to be researched. With videos to reinforce thematic contents of the subject, they developed processes of synthesis, verification and application of the theory in identifying their object of study for the development of their research project through the technique (PBL) and collaborative work actions. The teacher was a facilitating agent and mentor who promoted the development of attitudes such as critical thinking, collaborative work, originality, lead- ership,creativityandtransversalvaluesintheeducationofthestudentbodysuchasrespect, tolerance, empathy and ethics.

Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies trainin g processes from actions such as self-evaluation, co-evaluation and one-way evalua- tion. This was carried out through progress reviews, delivery of reports, participant obser- vation processes, SWOT’s delivered by the students themselves on the improvements to be developed in thesubject and theworkdone usingwiki, chats, forums andnetworked media such as Skype. All of this was developed from a philosophy of evaluating to learn. Finally, in the learning process the student body evidenced a change on the importance of research for the improvement of its own didactic model from their work with “Semilleros de investi- gación” (Seas, 2016), recognizing the importance of collaborative work in the development ofresearchprocessesandfromtheuseofamethodologyorientedtowardsdoing,supported by technological tools of greater interaction. This led to the development of digital and research competencies, which had not been attended, although they had been identified, in the stages of diagnostic and processual research. As for the interviews with teachers and students in order to validate the effectiveness of a new learning methodology, an electronic interview was conducted1; in which both actors agreedthatinordertoestablishimprovementsinthelearningmethodologyitwasnecessary to consider aspects such as follow-up, continuous evaluation, development of clear instruc- tions, collaborative work and permanent feedback (interview with teachers, December 22, 2017) and that in order to achieve such improvements it was advisable to first train the teaching team in the Lean Startup methodology and in the tools to be used in virtual envi- ronments before implementing a new methodology. They highlighted the importance of entering into new learning practices for achieving contextualized and significant learning, and on the other hand, the need to bear in mind the interests of
and significant learning, and on the other hand, the need to bear in mind the interests of the university, the increase in the working hours of the team of trainers, since with the current dedication (1 4T) lit tle can be done to generate innovation processes. It also highlights some of the teachers’ own impressions of the proposed methodology: P4. ”Yes, I agree, being an entrepreneur is an excellent option for the development of competent professionals who are open to the chal- lengesoftoday’smarketandlaborcontext”. (Professor4, personalcommunication, Decem- ber 22, 2017) (Ávalos, 2018, p. 291), other teacher contributions are also highlighted: P1. Yes, I agree, from my point of view it is necessary to do different things to obtain different results, it seems to me a viable proposal from the resources required for its implementation and to test different methodologies. (Professor 4, personal communication, December 22, 2017). P3. Nowadays an entrepreneurial attitude is necessary in any area of life, there- fore, in education, considering that it is a field that is continually being renewed, being innovative is a necessity.

Carolina, Ávalos; et al. Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies 4DISCUSSION AND CONCL USIONS The changes evidenced in the role of the teacher, the methodology used, the techniques and didactic strategies used with technological support from an effective and didactic mediation, favored in the final stage of the research, the achievement of the learning expe- rience and the development of research and digital competencies such as collaborative work, problem solving, critical and reflective thinking, communication and ethical atti- tude. These results reinforce the conclusions of other similar studies by Gupte(2015),Link (2016),Siddiq,Scherer,andTondeur (2016), and Patiño,Cruz,andGómez (2016), inwhich it was demonstrated that the inclusion of innovative methodological practices fostered the transversal competency development of students. Furthermore, from the acquisition of digital competencies, the results of the research made it clear that in the initial and processual stages, only the competence of an open atti- tude towards the knowledge society and the use of digital resources had been evidenced in a percentage greater than 50%, prevailing among learners a lack of knowledge of office automation skills and a complete lack of ubiquitous understanding of technological tools to transform the learning achieved in real-world solutions. This complemented the contribu- tions of López(2013), Sevillano and Vázquez (2015) and Sepúlveda et al. (2017). Therefore, with the implementation of the Lean Startup methodology, it was possible to show that digital competencies based on the approaches of Rangel (2015), Fernández and Fernández (2016), –referring to the effective use of information, communication from network spaces, information management, use of ethics, creation of educational content, responsible use of technologies, improvement proposals from concrete and realistic appli- cable actions– could be developed during the
proposals from concrete and realistic appli- cable actions– could be developed during the different learning experiences and work methodology implementing the phases of the Lean Startup method: building, measuring and learning. Bearingthisinmindtheacquisitionofsoftskillssuchasself-regulation,self-motivation, a mind set for coping with change, communication, leadership and empathy is empha- sized (Patiño et al., 2016). Coincidentally, the skills mentioned are compatible with others favoredbytheLeanStartupMethodestablishedby Riyantietal. (2017)and Peñalver (2017): namely communication, teamwork, creativity and problem solving. According to Borafull (2014) the contributions on the reality of companies are, as he states: “currently developed within networks of cells with their own knowledge and not in pyramids; they do not compete, they communicate, cooperate and create online”, (p. 156). Followingthis,itwouldappearnecessarytorethinkthemethodologiesusedtoeducatepro- fessionals, considering from their educational curriculum, the opportunities offered by the Lean Startup method, it can be concluded from their research, that this method is a driver of soft skills within which entrepreneurial thinking takes strength (Gupte, 2015; Schwarts, 2016). The work presented here reinforces proactive attitudes such as those proposed by Luna (2015)and Sepúlvedaetal. (2017)thatvisualizethepossibilitiesofentrepreneurialthinking as a competency that can be transversal to several areas; from entrepreneurship ( Schwarts, 2016;Sepúlveda et al., 2017) , innovation and research ( Anderson, 2016; Davison & Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research, 8(2) j2019 jhttps://doi.org/10.7821/naer.2019.7.438 239

Because only then will the acqui- sition of research and digital competencies be executed in an innate way in the learning processes thus achieving a profile of a comprehensive professional, that meets ”in situ” with the demands of this century.

However, learning methodologies used by professors seem to be detached from reality, preventing the development of applicable learning, as well as the acquisition of those skills necessary in the twenty-first century. The main objective of the research is to analyze the Lean Startup method as a learning methodology in the creation of digital and research competencies in students from the UNED Costa Rica during the development of the course: Mixed Methods Research (MMR). The sample consisted of 531 individuals, teachers and students from different degrees of the School of Education from the UNED who took the course during the years 2015 to 2017. A mixed explanatory sequential design was used, with a theoretical part of an exploration of the method, a quantitative part (descriptive analysis and contrast of means) and another qualitative part by means of content analysis. The results showed the effectiveness of an
another qualitative part by means of content analysis. The results showed the effectiveness of an innovative methodology such as Lean Startup in the development of digital and research skills, and the change of the teacher’s role in the teaching process.

However, certain authors in their research, such as Cajide et al. (2002),Voogt and Roblin (2012), Clemente and Escribá (2013) have pointed out the need for universities to be more linked to the requirements of companies as well as to the needs and demands of society, taking into account the daily reality which is where the different skills and abilities acquired during the years of study How to cite this article (APA): Ávalos, C., Pérez-Escoda, A., & Monge, L.

Carolina, Ávalos; et al. Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies are put to test. In this way, the other conglomerate of capacities, abilities and skills for the integral development of the professional can start to be considered in the processes of professional training. From research carried out on the subject ever since the beginning of the 21st cen- tury (OCDE, 2005; OECD, 2018; Rychen & Salganik, 2000) we can find an international concern towards the appropriate skills that the education system must provide for citizens to face the challenges of the new century. Skills such as learning to innovate, digital and office literacy, improving people’s personal and professional life, as well as axiological and ethical training, are some of those that stand out in the current century. Authors such asLuna(2015) and Figueroa (2017) coincide in the need to acquire skills such as those indicated which prepare citizens for current challenges and demands, thus highlighting the need to rethink the learning methodology towards roles and training spaces that are more participatory and applied to experiential contexts. In this sense, from different international contexts the appropriate skills for this century havebeendefined, fromdiversemodelsofdevelopmentarisingfromtheassociationofuni- versities such as Partnership for 21st Century (2009); from international organisms such asUNESCO (2008 2016) and OECD (2018), from the European Union ( Vuorikari, Punie, Carretero, & Brande, 2016) or from the national scope, in this case Costa Rica (Zúñiga, Núñez, Brenes, & Chacón, 2013). However, from the responsibility that universities must assume in providing solutions to the demands of society, Shank(2011) criticizes that, from the reality of the system, there is a decontextualized training of the needs of each population. That is to say a learning system which lacks meaning and in its absence, reproduces contents that are not significant for
system which lacks meaning and in its absence, reproduces contents that are not significant for the students in their training, and develops tough competition, instrumental abilities and skills without the necessary understanding to be adapted to real scenarios. As stated by Alabart (sf) (quoted in Borafull 2014), “the current educational system forces everyone to go through the tube of homogenization, not considering individual talents and instilling knowledge of a generic and non-significant character” (p. 156). According to the scenario presented and focusing on digital and research competen- cies, it can be assured that the student body in its training process receives instruction about the use of technological resources and knowledge mainly of bibliographic research processes (Campos & Chinchilla, 2009; Jou & Wang, 2013; López, 2013; Rectores, 2017), However, none of these inputs refer to the acquisition of digital and research competencies from an innate understanding, nor, to how the development of such skills allows students to transfer the knowledge acquired to other scenarios from intrinsic processes. 1. 1 Digital competencies Digital competency, as such, appears in the European Reference Framework in 2006 in recognition of the European Union of basic skills that every citizen of the 21st century should develop in order to be competent: Recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 18, 2006 on key competencies for lifelong learning. Although digital competency was recognized and defined as one of the 8 basic competen- Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research, 8(2) j2019 jhttps://doi.org/10.7821/naer.2019.7.438 228
Carolina, Ávalos; et al. Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies cies, it was not until 2013 ( Ferrari, 2013) that a well-founded definition was established: Digital competency is a set of knowledge, skills, attitudes, strategies, values and awareness required when using ICT and digital media to perform tasks, solve problems, communicate, manage information, collaborate, create and share con- tent and build knowledge in an effective, efficient, appropriate, critical, creative, autonomous, flexible, ethical and reflective way for work, leisure, participation, learning, socialization, consumption and empowerment (Ferrari, 2013, p. 4) This study takes the European Reference Framework as a theoretical base, in which the ref- erence framework and understanding of digital competency is developed in 2013 ( Ferrari, 2013)andrevisedin2016( Vuorikarietal.,2016). Followingthis, thefollowingdigitalcom- petencies have been identified for our study (Vuorikari et al., 2016) • Information management: related to effective searches, evaluation, storage and retrieval of information. • Communication: including all communicative actions carried out through ICT tools (social networks, blogs, chats, etc.). • Content creation: such as the ability to create all kinds of content (blogs, websites, wikis, presentations, infographics, etc.). • Problem solving: with a specific focus on critical thinking and problem solving cen- tered on technology and with the effective ability to find answers to questions posed. • Security: related to digital identity management, privacy, configuration of tools and profiles, etc. 1.2 Research competencies In 2010, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development established a series of research competencies to be developed in the twenty-first century, those that would pro- mote problem solving actions to solve problems for reflective thinking, ethical and social impact, communication, adaptability and
solve problems for reflective thinking, ethical and social impact, communication, adaptability and organization; such competencies will be consid- ered in the analysis of this research, since they have been reinforced thanks to studies con- ducted by Jou and Wang (2013),Davison and Palermo (2015), Luna(2015) and Anderson (2016), which have coincided with the approaches of the OECD. Currently one of the main concerns of the education system is the lack of research skills in the training of its professionals, as has been demonstrated in recent years, from statisti- cal reports such as the State of Education and studies developed in Costa Rican territory, highlighting the lack of research productions from this sector ( Ávalos, 2018). Taking into account the competency needs of the 21st century and considering the con- tributions of Riyanti, Sandroto, and DW (2017) , Borafull (2014),Luna(2015), and Gisbert and Lázaro (2015), on the skills that every professional must develop in this century, the search for emerging methods was carried out. This took place in those disciplines where successfulresultshadbeenidentifiedallowingforthedevelopmentofmetacognitionspaces, which were missing in the teacher training of UNED students. In this way, the Lean Startup Method became relevant to be applied as a learning methodology.

Carolina, Ávalos; et al. Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies 1.3 Lean Startup as a learning methodology The Lean Startup method was created by Erick Ries in 2011. According to Ries, the method enhancesthose”practicesthatfavorthecreationofStartupssuccessfullyandwithlittlelike- lihood of experiencing losses” (Ries, 2011, p. 39). It is based on the scientific method for its execution and considers a series of steps that are fundamental in its development: creating, measuring and learning. Authorssuchas Fishbein (2014),GutiérrezandApaolaza (2014),Ritika(2015)and Peñalver (2017) perceive a diversified implementation of the method from areas other than Business Administration, thereby promoting the development of a new learning methodology that favors processes such as: • The contextualization of knowledge: working with learning experiences with a real- istic approach, promoting an improvement of mindset and problem solving. • The development of entrepreneurial attitudes: by enhancing collaborative work, cre- ative mentality, effective communication, permanent observation, experimentation, analysis of situations, development of innovative proposals. All of which, together with technological resources can appropriate the student body with digital compe- tencyandfromdesignprocesses, withthemeasurementofproposals, theverification and socialization of results and the research competency. • The development of soft skills is encouraged: those that predispose students to adopt changes and adjust to them in a proactive way, to be empathetic, to know how to look for solutions to different situations, to develop divergent thinking, processes of self-motivation and thus flexible and innovative thinking. 2METHOD The study took place in three stages during the years 2015-2017, and included as a study population the student body of the School of Educational Sciences, who were taking the course Mixed Methods Research (MMR).

Carolina, Ávalos; et al. Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies The s tudy is framed within a descriptive, explanatory and applied research which has been developed in three stages: diagnostic, processual and final ( Pérez, 2006). It is an explanatory sequential mixed type ( Creswell, 2015), which seeks to respond to the phe- nomenon studied by contrasting qualitative and quantitative data ( Pérez, Galán, & Quin- tanal, 2012). 2. 1 Sample ThestudywascarriedoutwithstudentsfromdifferentdegreesoftheFacultyofEducational Sciences who were studying the course Mixed Methods Research during the years 2015 to 2017andprofessorswhoofferedthesubjectduringthoseyears. Inpractice,therewasatotal sample of 531 subjects of which 319 were women and 212 were men; the average age of the participants was between 30 to 50 years old. Sampling was carried out for the diagnostic and processual stage in a simple random probability with 95% reliability and a 5% margin of error, considering 116 students and 3 teachers in the diagnostic stage, 201 students in the processual stage who participated in the survey and a review of performance reports of 173 other students in the subject. The final stage was done in a non-probabilistic way for convenience, working with a group of 33 students and 5 teachers from the course ( Sáez, 2017). 2.2 Creation of the survey In the diagnostic and processual stage, two surveys were designed as data collection instru- ments with the intention of knowing the achievement of digital and research competencies reached by the students in the course. Each survey consisted of 5 parts: sociodemographic information, methodology used, methodological strategies, ICT resources used, research skills and abilities achieved at the end of the course; Likert scales were used in its deploy- ment. Also, interviews were conducted with teachers in the diagnostic stage. In the final stage, interviews were conducted with students and --- teachers in the diagnostic stage. In the final stage, interviews were conducted with students and teachers, as well as observation pro- cesses using checklists. The validation of the surveys and interviews was carried out by experts in the areas of Technology, Pedagogy and Research prior to deploying them to the participating sample ( McMillan & Schumacher, 2005). The variables to be analyzed were: theacquisitionofdigitalandresearchcompetenciesasdependentvariablesandasindepen- dent variables: learning methodology, ICT resources and learning experiences. 2.3 Reliability of the survey For the quantitative part of the survey, the statistical package SPSS was used, highlighting a normal distribution in the behavior of the variables, the factorial analysis technique was used to determine the correlation of the variables; from the results of KMO and Bartlett tests, a high level of correlation between the factors 0.903 was shown, with a high signif- icance.

was first carried out to group the competencies, highlighting from the matrix of components a reduction of factors to two predominant components in the digital com- petency (CD): information management (.649) and problem solving using critical thinking (-.617). In the case of research competencies (IQ) one component was highlighted: com- munication (.701). Once the competency factors were identified, the correlation was made with the methodology used by the teaching staff, highlighting a significance in the digi- tal information management competency (CD 2, see Table 2) with regard to the other two competencies. The results in table 2 demonstrate a high significance that is changing in information management (CD2) in contrast with the methodology variables, with p < .05. This means that the (CD2) is going to increase or decrease according to the type of methodology devel- oped by the teaching staff in the subject. Problem solving (CD1) and communication com- petencies(CI)didnotachievethissignificancewhich,accordingtothedatapresented,seem to require another type of methodology that favors the development of these competencies in learning processes.

As a result, more than 50% of the research
of new knowledge construction processes ( Ávalos, 2018). As a result, more than 50% of the research competencies focused on information search and content analysis capacities, and in percentages lower than 50% other relevant competencies, such as: problem solving, critical and reflective thinking, ethical-social impact and communication, based on studies by Jou and Wang (2013), and OECD (2018). Among the digital competencies achieved according to the student body and in a percent- age greater than 50% were: a positive attitude towards the use of technological resources and the use of certain tools on the platform, leaving other competencies undeveloped with a percentage data below 40%. These included: communication and collaboration, the creation of digital content in problem solving, which have been supported in studies Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research, 8(2) j2019 jhttps://doi.org/10.7821/naer.2019.7.438 234

Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies LMS pl atform, identifying those that would be of greater benefit in the student’s analysis and reflection processes for the subject’s learning experiences and those which, in addition, would promote collaborative work. Therefore, the use of reflective journals and wiki were some of the tools incorporated into the learning experience, as well as others detailed in the previous table. The aim was to level the workload on the platform based on the observations made in previous periods (2016-1 and 2016-2), ensuring that the activities were interrelated, so that the group’s efforts to generate an electronic dictionary on research topics using the Wiki and individual reflections developed in reflective journals were contributions that assigned more weight to the knowledge of each student in the subject (MMR). This was done in order to generate their own research project approach and make an effective pedagogical use of technological tools that they had not used before, which allowed them to increase their knowledge and practice in the use of technology while developing research knowl- edge, encouraging also the use of other tools such as Skype, WhatsApp and Chat, and more accompaniment and motivation that was highlighted by the students in the SWOT’s ( Áva- los, 2018). As for the development of the subject improvements (MMR), prior to the changes it was necessary to develop a learning methodology, which is presented inFigure 3 with the Figur e 2Redesign of teaching strategies Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research, 8(2) j2019 jhttps://doi.org/10.7821/naer.2019.7.438 236
Carolina, Ávalos; et al. Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies implementation of the Lean Startup method as a learning methodology. By materializing the system that underpins the Lean Startup build-measure-learn methodology, it was possible for students to move from a methodology focused on instruc- tionallearningtoonebydoing. Inthisway,inthebuildingstagethestudentbodydeveloped activities that allowed them to reinforce observation, inquiry, analysis and reflection. They interacted constantly with different tools such as Wiki in collaborative learning spaces for the development of a digital dictionary on research topics, with the reflective diary in the development of weekly annotations, sensitizing their observations on the object of study to be researched. With videos to reinforce thematic contents of the subject, they developed processes of synthesis, verification and application of the theory in identifying their object of study for the development of their research project through the technique (PBL) and collaborative work actions. The teacher was a facilitating agent and mentor who promoted the development of attitudes such as critical thinking, collaborative work, originality, lead- ership,creativityandtransversalvaluesintheeducationofthestudentbodysuchasrespect, tolerance, empathy and ethics.

Carolina, Ávalos; et al. Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies trainin g processes from actions such as self-evaluation, co-evaluation and one-way evalua- tion. This was carried out through progress reviews, delivery of reports, participant obser- vation processes, SWOT’s delivered by the students themselves on the improvements to be developed in thesubject and theworkdone usingwiki, chats, forums andnetworked media such as Skype. All of this was developed from a philosophy of evaluating to learn. Finally, in the learning process the student body evidenced a change on the importance of research for the improvement of its own didactic model from their work with “Semilleros de investi- gación” (Seas, 2016), recognizing the importance of collaborative work in the development ofresearchprocessesandfromtheuseofamethodologyorientedtowardsdoing,supported by technological tools of greater interaction. This led to the development of digital and research competencies, which had not been attended, although they had been identified, in the stages of diagnostic and processual research. As for the interviews with teachers and students in order to validate the effectiveness of a new learning methodology, an electronic interview was conducted1; in which both actors agreedthatinordertoestablishimprovementsinthelearningmethodologyitwasnecessary to consider aspects such as follow-up, continuous evaluation, development of clear instruc- tions, collaborative work and permanent feedback (interview with teachers, December 22, 2017) and that in order to achieve such improvements it was advisable to first train the teaching team in the Lean Startup methodology and in the tools to be used in virtual envi- ronments before implementing a new methodology. They highlighted the importance of entering into new learning practices for achieving contextualized and significant learning, and on the other hand, the need to bear in mind the interests of
Carolina, Ávalos; et al. Lean Startup as a Learning Methodology for Developing Digital and Research Competencies 4DISCUSSION AND CONCL USIONS The changes evidenced in the role of the teacher, the methodology used, the techniques and didactic strategies used with technological support from an effective and didactic mediation, favored in the final stage of the research, the achievement of the learning expe- rience and the development of research and digital competencies such as collaborative work, problem solving, critical and reflective thinking, communication and ethical atti- tude. These results reinforce the conclusions of other similar studies by Gupte(2015),Link (2016),Siddiq,Scherer,andTondeur (2016), and Patiño,Cruz,andGómez (2016), inwhich it was demonstrated that the inclusion of innovative methodological practices fostered the transversal competency development of students. Furthermore, from the acquisition of digital competencies, the results of the research made it clear that in the initial and processual stages, only the competence of an open atti- tude towards the knowledge society and the use of digital resources had been evidenced in a percentage greater than 50%, prevailing among learners a lack of knowledge of office automation skills and a complete lack of ubiquitous understanding of technological tools to transform the learning achieved in real-world solutions. This complemented the contribu- tions of López(2013), Sevillano and Vázquez (2015) and Sepúlveda et al. (2017). Therefore, with the implementation of the Lean Startup methodology, it was possible to show that digital competencies based on the approaches of Rangel (2015), Fernández and Fernández (2016), –referring to the effective use of information, communication from network spaces, information management, use of ethics, creation of educational content, responsible use of technologies, improvement proposals from concrete and realistic appli- cable actions– could be developed during the
proposals from concrete and realistic appli- cable actions– could be developed during the different learning experiences and work methodology implementing the phases of the Lean Startup method: building, measuring and learning. Bearingthisinmindtheacquisitionofsoftskillssuchasself-regulation,self-motivation, a mind set for coping with change, communication, leadership and empathy is empha- sized (Patiño et al., 2016). Coincidentally, the skills mentioned are compatible with others favoredbytheLeanStartupMethodestablishedby Riyantietal. (2017)and Peñalver (2017): namely communication, teamwork, creativity and problem solving. According to Borafull (2014) the contributions on the reality of companies are, as he states: “currently developed within networks of cells with their own knowledge and not in pyramids; they do not compete, they communicate, cooperate and create online”, (p. 156). Followingthis,itwouldappearnecessarytorethinkthemethodologiesusedtoeducatepro- fessionals, considering from their educational curriculum, the opportunities offered by the Lean Startup method, it can be concluded from their research, that this method is a driver of soft skills within which entrepreneurial thinking takes strength (Gupte, 2015; Schwarts, 2016). The work presented here reinforces proactive attitudes such as those proposed by Luna (2015)and Sepúlvedaetal. (2017)thatvisualizethepossibilitiesofentrepreneurialthinking as a competency that can be transversal to several areas; from entrepreneurship ( Schwarts, 2016;Sepúlveda et al., 2017) , innovation and research ( Anderson, 2016; Davison & Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research, 8(2) j2019 jhttps://doi.org/10.7821/naer.2019.7.438 239

Because only then will the acqui- sition of research and digital competencies be executed in an innate way in the learning processes thus achieving a profile of a comprehensive professional, that meets ”in situ” with the demands of this century.
