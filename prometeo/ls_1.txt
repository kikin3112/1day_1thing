A set of pragmatic methods drawing on lean and agile principles has recently been proposed to support digital entrepreneurs facing Business Model Innovation (BMI), known as Lean StartupApproaches (LSAs). However, the theoretical and practical relationship between BMI and LSAs in dynamic di- gital environments has seldom been investigated. To ﬁll this gap, our study draws on an exploratory multiple- case study based on three digital multisided platform startups to craft a uni ﬁed framework that can disclose the relationship between BMI, LSAs and Agile Development (AD), within the context of Strategic Agility. Our ﬁn- dings, which emerge from the uni ﬁed framework, show that LSAs can be employed as agile methods to enable Business Model Innovation in Digital Entrepreneurship. These ﬁndings are then organized around a set of propositions, with the aim of developing a research agenda directed towards integrating BMI, LSAs and AD processes and methods. 1. Introduction In the early stages of their development, new ventures and startups frequently undergo change and innovation ( McDougall & Oviatt, 1996 ), because of their need to tackle resource scarcity and align their internal acquired resources to the external conditions ( Hanlon & Saunders, 2007 ;Katila & Shane, 2005 ). This is particularly true for
conditions ( Hanlon & Saunders, 2007 ;Katila & Shane, 2005 ). This is particularly true for startups op- erating in a dynamic and uncertain digital context ( Courtney, Kirkland, & Viguerie, 1997; Sirmon, Hitt, & Ireland, 2007), where the impact of pervasive and multipurpose digital technologies increases the pace of change, leading to signi ﬁcant transformations in a number of industries (Bharadwaj, El Sawy, Pavlou, & Venkatraman, 2013 ;Ghezzi, Cortimiglia, & Frank, 2015 ;Kalakota & Robinson, 1999). Within such a dynamic context, innovating is an intricate exercise that demands idiosyncratic and seemingly divergent approaches and tools which digital startups can select as required, depending on the direction they intend to take when embarking upon their innovation process. We argue that the theoretical and practical relationship between these approaches and tools is worth investigating, and should speci ﬁ- cally examine the way in which early stage digital startups innovatetheir business model by leveraging on emerging agile and lean prac- tices. Innovation in early stage digital startups moves along two di ﬀerentalbeit intertwined paths: (i) innovation necessary to modify and adapt their products, services and value proposition to changing internal and/ or market conditions - and mostly refers to the process of New Product Development (NPD) ( Brown & Eisenhardt, 1995 ;Krishnan & Ulrich, 2001 ); and (ii) innovation to their business model - i.e. the overall value architecture and related mechanisms they set around their value pro- position to generate value for target customers, place such value on the market and retain part of it to ensure economic and ﬁnancial viability (Rappa, 2001; Teece, 2010 ;Timmers, 1998; Weill & Vitale, 2013 ). This second path expands the concept of NPD to embrace the fragmented but rapidly growing research stream and practice onBusiness Model Innovation (BMI) ( Schneider & Spieth, 2013 ;Teece, 2010 ;Zott, Amit, & Massa, 2011), referred
Innovation (BMI) ( Schneider & Spieth, 2013 ;Teece, 2010 ;Zott, Amit, & Massa, 2011), referred to as the design and in- troduction of “novel, non-trivial changes to the key elements of a ﬁrm's business model and/or the architecture linking these elements ”(Foss and Saebi, 2018, p. 201). Although NPD and BMI research streams and practices should inherently be related, so far they have evolved in a largely disconnected fashion. In their path to bring about product, service and value proposition innovation, startups operating in this digital age can exploit a number of approaches that fall under the domain of agile methods. Within this group, Agile Development (AD) refers to practices for software devel- opment based on the centrality of individuals and interaction, incre- mental delivery of working software, collaboration with customers and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.06.013 Received 1 February 2017; Received in revised form 18 June 2018; Accepted 19 June 2018⁎Corresponding author.

response to change (e.g. see Beck et al., 2001 ;Senapathi & Srinivasan, 2012 ;Rigby, Sutherland, & Takeuchi, 2016 ;Cram & Newell, 2016; Paluch et al., 2017 ). With reference to the second path, the question of how to innovate a digital startup's overall business model - which includes and comple- ments its value proposition ( Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010 ;Teece, 2010 ) - was recently tackled through a set of pragmatic approaches referred toas the Lean Startup ( Ries, 2011 ) and Customer Development ( Blank, 2013 ). Both of these Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs) were conceived as a means to support entrepreneurs in the process of validating and in- novating their business model ( Trimi & Berbegal-Mirabent, 2012 ) through market tests and early customer feedback, thus triggering aprocess known as the “build-measure-learn ”loop ( Blank, 2013 ;Ries, 2011 ). Despite being wide-spread throughout the entrepreneurial community ( Maurya, 2012 ;Yang, Sun, & Zhao, 2018), LSAs' academic relevance and soundness is still met with scepticism among scholars. Asa result, there is as yet no strong theoretical foundation for these ap- proaches in the literature, although it would be of great help for ac- cumulating knowledge in the ﬁeld. With reference to the theoretical underpinnings and antecedents, Ries (2011) andBlank (2013) clearly connect LSAs with “lean philo- sophy ”- and its ﬁrst application in the manufacturing world ( Womack & Jones, 1997 ) - by deﬁ ning LSAs as a startup's attempts to cut its waste, understood as all its operations and processes which the targetcustomer does not want or does not ask for ( Blank, 2013 ;Ries, 2011 ); however, such connection has never been deeply or thoroughly in-vestigated. A similar problem emerges concerning the relationship between LSAs and Agile Development methods, where this link, despite poten- tially being intuitive ( Blank, 2013 ), is seldom elaborated on further. Extant research in the manufacturing ﬁeld proposes a “leagile ”method
seldom elaborated on further. Extant research in the manufacturing ﬁeld proposes a “leagile ”method that crosses agile with lean philosophies (e.g. see Naylor, Naim, & Berry, 1999; Mason-Jones, Naylor, & Towill, 2000 ;Agarwal, Shankar, & Tiwari, 2006), although this discussion does not touch upon LSAs -probably because of the recent and as yet non-systematic application of these principles to the domains of strategy, entrepreneurship and in- novation. Moreover, while there appears to be an explicit link between the process of iteration carried out on the business model components and mechanisms set out in LSAs and the process of Business ModelInnovation, this relationship is seldom recognized within the relatively fragmented literature on BMI, which still su ﬀers from paradigmatic problems ( Foss & Saebi, 2018 ;Zott et al., 2011 ). The proliferation of di ﬀerent practices that can possibly help en- trepreneurs in their innovation endeavors, together with the substantiallack of a clear and uniﬁ ed theory backing such practices, together contribute towards creating a rather confusing setting that ampli ﬁes the problems that startups are already having to face, thus jeopardizing their quest for survival. These considerations are even more relevant in the context of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems ( Cavallo, Ghezzi, & Balocco, 2018; Nambisan, 2017), where digital startups have to cope with environ-mental dynamism that either forces them to adapt their business model to the volatile environment in which they operate, or o ﬀers them the chance to innovate their business model and so trigger more dynamicphenomena ( Downes & Nunes, 2013 ). This study aims at positioning our contribution at the crossroads of the above discussions and gaps in theory and practice, by exploring how LSAs act as agile methods for Business Model Innovation in Digital Entrepreneurship. To this end, we will design an exploratory multiple case study based on three digital startups, using it to
end, we will design an exploratory multiple case study based on three digital startups, using it to investigate: (i) whether and how BMI carried out by early stage digital multisided platform startups in moderately or highly dynamic environments is related to LSAs and AD; and (ii) whether and how the focus of BMI processes - in terms of its steps and constituent elements - changes when considering amoderately dynamic environment (Case A) or a highly dynamic en- vironment in which the digital startup operates (Case B), or a highly dynamic environment determined by the digital startup itself (Case C). Our study will contribute to both theory and practice in a number of ways. First, we found that LSAs are tightly connected to agile methods and, as a result, we claim that LSAs can be understood as a form of Agile Development applied to products, services, value propositions and whole business models. This argument adds to the open debate cur-rently questioning the range of application for agile practices in busi- ness and management ( Cooper & Sommer, 2016 ). Second, according to our reasoning, LSAs are agile methods for Business Model Innovation,and therefore the theoretical foundations of LSAs are grounded in the BMIﬁeld. Third, we have developed a uniﬁ ed framework and set of propositions that connect Business Model Innovation, Lean StartupApproaches and Agile Development and position this relationship within the context of Strategic Agility. Fourth, concerning practice, digital entrepreneurs may ﬁnd our framework and propositions useful while designing and innovating their business models under varyingconditions of environmental dynamism and with the startup taking on diﬀerent roles when confronting or determining these conditions. The remainder of the study is organized as follows. In Section 2,w e illustrate the theoretical background at the basis of our investigation. In Section 3, we describe the research design and the cases, then presented inSection 4; and in
In Section 3, we describe the research design and the cases, then presented inSection 4; and in Sections 5 and 6 we show and discuss the results of our empirical analysis. Finally, in Section 7, we draw the conclusions, opening the avenues for further research. 2. Theory 2.1. Business Model Innovation The research stream of Business Models and Business Model Innovation (BMI) springs from a combination of various Strategic Management theories, such as transaction cost economics, resource- based views of a ﬁrm, system theory and strategic network theory ( Amit & Zott, 2001 ;Hedman & Kalling, 2001 ;Morris, Schindehutte, & Allen, 2005 ). The business model, both as a concept and a related construct, has largely referred to the value architecture of a business ( Foss & Saebi, 2018 ;Rappa, 2001; Teece, 2010 ;Timmers, 1998 ;Weill & Vitale, 2013), that is, how the ﬁrm creates value, delivers this value to its customers and entices them to pay, eventually converting these payments to pro ﬁt (Teece, 2010 ). BMI, by contrast, deals with “designed, novel, non-trivial changes to the key elements of a ﬁrm's business model and/or the ar- chitecture linking these elements ”(Foss and Saebi, 2018, p. 201). Notwithstanding the great emphasis that the literature has recently placed on developing an understanding of Business Models and their innovation ( Zott et al., 2011), this research stream and the associated practice both still su ﬀer from a severe lack of homogeneity, clarity and direction ( Ghezzi, 2013 ;Johnson, Christensen, & Kagermann, 2008; Wirtz, Pistoia, Ullrich, & Göttel, 2016 ). Massa, Tucci and Afuah recently tackled this controversial state in the current academic debate (2016), ﬁnding that, beyond the tradi- tional interpretation whereby business models are seen as formal con- ceptual representations of how a business is structured and functions - i.e. aﬁrm's value architecture -, two further perspectives have emerged from the management literature: (i) business
architecture -, two further perspectives have emerged from the management literature: (i) business models as attributes ofrealﬁrms; and (ii) business models as cognitive/linguistic schemas. This fragmentation has led scholars to debate whether de ﬁning business models and BMI is actually a “wicked ”problem - a problem so poorly deﬁ ned and structured that inquiry appears hopeless ( Buchanan, 1992 ).Foss and Saebi (2018) eventually argued that, instead of being a wicked problem, what burdens business models and BMI research is rather a “paradigmatic ”issue, where a lack of construct clarity, little agreement about deﬁ nitions and the di ﬃculty in ﬁnding the dimensions for assessing core constructs together currently limit cumulative theoryA.

from being built and tested. In an attempt to solve this issue, Foss and Saebi (2018) proposed that business models and BMI should be assessed in terms of the architecture of the ﬁrm's value creation, delivery and capture mechanisms - in line with Teece (2010) . The deﬁ nition and assessment of business models and their in- novation process has become a topic of paramount importance in the ﬁelds of strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship, because a growing number of scholars and practitioners agree that well-established com-panies and startups should now look beyond their isolated product, service or process innovation and focus instead on innovating their entire business model, which becomes the new unit of analysis for in- novation e ﬀorts ( Chesbrough, 2007, 2010 ;Lindgardt, Reeves, Stalk, & Deimler, 2009 ). BMI involves innovation to at least one of the foundational elements of value creation, delivery and capture, and thereby gives a ﬁrm the potential to activate overlooked value sources within the company or create news systems that are di ﬃcult to imitate ( Amit & Zott, 2012 ). To date, the literature contains notable contributions and evidence on successful examples of Business Model Innovation processes relating mainly to large organizations ( Amit & Zott, 2012 ;Chesbrough, 2007; Johnson et al., 2008 ;Schaltegger, Lüdeke-Freund, & Hansen, 2012; Sosna, Trevinyo-Rodríguez, & Velamuri, 2010), although BMI also re- fers to smaller organizations and startups ( Klewitz & Hansen, 2014 ). More importantly, scholars and practitioners alike are calling for thedevelopment of practical tools and approaches to support Business Model Innovation (e.g. Foss & Saebi, 2018 ;Trimi & Berbegal-Mirabent, 2012 ). In line with this concluding remark, we will argue that Lean Startup Approaches should be interpreted as a ﬁrst - albeit still mostly unrecognized - attempt to ﬁll this gap. 2.2. Lean Startup Approaches “Lean philosophy ”and its principles originated in the manu-
this gap. 2.2. Lean Startup Approaches “Lean philosophy ”and its principles originated in the manu- facturing world ( Hines, Holweg, & Rich, 2004 ;Womack & Jones, 1997 ) after the end of the Second World War, as a result of customers' needs evolving towards higher value in combination with companies' in- creasingly diverse o ﬀer. This signi ﬁcant redirection of production sys- tems towards customer value is summarized in the “ﬁve principles of lean ”described below ( Womack & Jones, 1997): 1.Create value for the customer . Value is created when internal waste decreases and so costs are reduced, and is increased by o ﬀering new services and/or functions valued by the customer. 2.Identify the value stream . The concept of value stream must not hide behind a wall of obscurity. The costs of every ﬁrm must be trans- parent to all supply chain partners. 3.Create ﬂow. The principle of creating ﬂow has the aim of avoiding any stoppage in the value stream by preventing the main causes ofsuch stoppages (i.e. changes in production, breakdowns, incorrect batches in terms of quantity or timing, lack of necessary information and re-entrant loops). 4.Produce only what is pulled by the customer . This principle implies high responsiveness while producing the highest quality products in an eﬃcient and valuable way. The production pull is extended up- hill to the suppliers and the whole upstream supply chain. 5.Pursue perfection by continuously identifying and eliminating waste. As emerges from these principles, lean can be de ﬁned as a customer and value-centric approach to creating a ﬂow of activities that con- tinuously generate customer value by eliminating non-value-addingactivities or “waste ”(Feld, 2000; Liker, 1997 ;Womack & Jones, 1997 ). While the lean philosophy arose in the manufacturing ﬁeld, recent attempts were made to extend its application and impact to neigh- bouring areas. For instance, Reinertsen and Shaeﬀ er (2005) showed that, if carefully implemented, this
areas. For instance, Reinertsen and Shaeﬀ er (2005) showed that, if carefully implemented, this philosophy can enhance R&D resultsand psychological motivation during exploration operations.Similarly, Ries (2011) andBlank (2013) made an attempt to adapt and combine the lean philosophy and its principles to the startups' development area by elaborating “Lean Startup ”and “Customer De- velopment ”methods - which we have grouped under the title of Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs). Borrowing from the overall deﬁ nition of lean, LSAs are deﬁ ned as the startup's attempt to cut its own waste, understood as all the activ- ities and processes which the target customer does not want or does not ask for ( Blank, 2013; Ries, 2011). LSAs consist of a scienti ﬁc, hypothesis-driven approach to en- trepreneurship, where entrepreneurs translate their vision - i.e. business idea - into falsi ﬁable hypotheses which are embedded in a ﬁrst version of a business model. These hypotheses are then tested through a seriesof minimum viable products (MVPs), which are “the smallest set of activities needed to disprove a hypothesis ”(Eisenmann  et al. 2012 - p. 2). In line with the scienti ﬁc method, hypotheses testing is performed through experiments that involve “evangelists ”, that is, expert prospects who can provide informed and useful feedback to the startup. Directly involving evangelists to test ideas and MVPs - rather than basing ones' evaluations merely on secondary data or “desk research” - is a clear illustration of the “get out of the building” approach advocated by Blank (2013) . On the basis of the test outcomes, entrepreneurs are faced with three main options: (i) persevere with their proposed business model - if the hypotheses are proven to be right; (ii) modify or pivot to a revised business model, where the business models parameters con ﬁrmed by the tests are retained and the others are improved on; (iii) or perish,that is, drop the business idea and, in turn, the startup that
are improved on; (iii) or perish,that is, drop the business idea and, in turn, the startup that was to have been launched around it. The process is iterated until all key hypotheses are con ﬁrmed or validated through MVP tests. When this condition is reached, the startup has achieved its “product-market ﬁt”(Eisenmann et al., 2012), which means that the value proposition designed and iteratively revised by the startup actually satis ﬁes the needs of its target customers. Product-market ﬁt hence represents the successful conclusion of the “build-measure-learn ”loop, where the startup builds an MVP and as- sociated tests, measures the test results and customer feedback andlearns how to change its business idea and business model accordingly. In a similar vein, Blank and Dorf's (2012) andBlank's (2013) Cus- tomer Development holds that entrepreneurs are ﬁrst called to “search ” for a scalable and replicable business model along the stages of cus-tomer discovery - i.e. identi ﬁcation of evangelists - and validation - i.e. experimenting and testing. This search is followed by the executionphase, where the startups consolidates and scales up their business validation model through customer creation - i.e. marketing spending - and company building - i.e. the structuring of organizational teams, functions and units. 2.3. Agile development According to Qumer and Henderson-Sellers (2006) , agility is the ability to accommodate and adapt to changes in a dynamic environ- ment. Being agile means applying previous knowledge while learning from current experience in order to deliver high-quality products, under budget constraints and in short time frames ( Jyothi & Rao, 2012). Agility hence encompasses the features of ﬂexibility, velocity, learning and response to change and leanness ( Campanelli & Parreiras, 2015; Conboy & Fitzgerald, 2004 ). Agile Development refers to a number of agility-enabling practices for software development ( Jalali & Wohlin, 2010 ;Lee & Yong, 2013 )
of agility-enabling practices for software development ( Jalali & Wohlin, 2010 ;Lee & Yong, 2013 ) that value the centrality of individuals and interaction, the incrementaldelivery of working software, collaboration with customers and re- sponse to change (e.g. Beck et al., 2001; Cram & Newell, 2016 ;Paluch et al., 2017 ;Rigby et al., 2016; Senapathi & Srinivasan, 2012). Campanelli and Parreiras (2015) recently carried out a survey on AD methods, ﬁnding that the most widely used methods are ExtremeA. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 521
Programming, Scrum, Kanban, Lean, Feature-Driven Development, Dynamic Systems Development Method, Adaptive Software Develop- ment, Crystal and Rational Uni ﬁed Process. These lists indicate that, in the extant literature, it is nothing new or indeed surprising for a leanpractice to be also considered an agile practice. For instance, the Kanban system - a popular lean tool created to manage manufacturing operations ( Ikonen, Kettunen, Oza, & Abrahamsson, 2010 ) - has also been applied to software development, and is therefore included amongthe agile methods ( Campanelli & Parreiras, 2015 ). Similarly, Barton (2009) argues that Scrum uses a lean “pull ”technique to smooth the ﬂow of the system. It follows that, although agile and lean are con- sidered to be distinct concepts (e.g. Hallgren & Olhager, 2009), scholars agree that agility includes “leanness ”as one of its most important at- tributes ( Conboy & Fitzgerald, 2004 ). In the supply chain and in soft- ware development ﬁelds, this recognized integration has led to the proposal of a combined lean and agile practice, called “leagile ”(Mason- Jones et al., 2000 ;Naylor et al., 1999; Wang, Conboy, & Cawley, 2012 ). In a similar vein to lean, agile methods are associated to a common “philosophy ”, where the main values and principles of focus are: (i) individuals and interaction; (ii) working software; (iii) customer col-laboration; and (iv) responding to change ( Campanelli & Parreiras, 2015 ). Although such overarching values and principles typically have a high level of abstraction, they were put forward by experienced prac-titioners ( Beck et al., 2001), who later worked to embed them into the AD methods employed today. The bene ﬁts for practice stemming from the application of AD methods have been widely recognized ( Cram & Newell, 2016 ;De Cesare, Lycett, Macredie, Patel, & Paul, 2010). AD methods are meant to take dynamism and uncertainty into fair account within the product innovation process, by including
take dynamism and uncertainty into fair account within the product innovation process, by including iterations, feed- back-feedforward cycles and intense testing procedures that depart signiﬁcantly from a well-structured - although often rigid plan-based - Stage-Gate approach ( Cooper, 2008). The Stage-Gate approach em- phasizes the crucial importance of extremely detailed upfront planning,to avoid wasting resources later during the execution and maintenance phases ( Cooper, 1990 ). Change is, therefore, perceived as something to possibly limit, and every step ahead is the result of a top down decision(Sommer, Hedegaard, Dukovska-Popovska, & Steger-Jensen, 2015 ). This point reveals that a pure Stage-Gate approach is most likely un-suitable in dynamic environments where change seems necessary on a regular basis. Conversely, Agile Development practices involve multiple short plan-execution cycles governed by customer feedback and rapid change ( Beck et al., 2001 ;Wang et al., 2012 ). A minimum amount of upfront planning and customer involvement in the development processare key elements in agile practices ( Wang et al., 2012 ). As well as the wide-spread adoption of agile methods and practices, scholars also highlight their possible shortcomings, such as deployment diﬃculties, sometimes ambiguous bene ﬁts and the lack of project ownership and accountability ( Balijepally, Mahapatra, Nerur, & Price, 2009 ;Cram & Newell, 2016 ;Drury, Conboy, & Power, 2012; Janes & Succi, 2012; Laanti, Salo, & Abrahamsson, 2011 ). A recent study by Conboy and Fitzgerald (2010) also sheds light on the need for organi- zations to customize AD methods to ﬁnd their own version, the one that bestﬁts their speci ﬁc challenges and objectives, all of which makes the method application less straightforward than commonly expected. Moreover, a current debate in business research is questioning the range of application for agile methods. Agile works well when handlingcomplex problems that can be
range of application for agile methods. Agile works well when handlingcomplex problems that can be broken down into distinct modules where iterations are feasible and mistakes are a chance to learn - rather than something to be necessarily avoided ( Rigby et al., 2016 ). Complex products with limited modularity may, instead, require a Stage-Gate,plan-based approach or a hybrid agile and Stage-Gate model, as sug- gested by Cooper and Sommer (2016) . This latter remark brings up another question and related gap in literature concerning the suitabilityof agile for validating and innovating a whole business model built around a product, service or value proposition. To date, few studiesfollow this promising research direction: however, since the business model is considered to be a complex and modular system of value (Massa, Tucci, & Afuah, 2016 ), the opportunity of applying forms of agile and AD when innovating a BM - understood as a modular object orsystem - is worth investigating. We will argue that the LSAs are the emerging form of a BMI-supporting AD. 3. Material and methods This research has been designed as an exploratory multiple case study ( Eisenhardt, 1989 ;Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007; Yin, 1984 ). A case study is an “empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context; when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident; and in which multiple sources of evidence are used ”(Yin, 1984 - p. 23 ). Within our multiple case study, we have examined the early stage Business Model Innovation process undertaken by three di ﬀerent digital multisided platform startups in real-life contexts that vary in terms ofenvironmental dynamism - moderate or high - and the relative role played by the startup - which can be subject to or instead determine this dynamism. Following Van Maanen (1979) and Clark, Gioia, Ketchen Jr., and Thomas (2010) , we selected an interpretive research approach, which “gives voice in the
Jr., and Thomas (2010) , we selected an interpretive research approach, which “gives voice in the interpretation of events in a ﬁrst-order ana- lysis to the people actually experiencing those events ”(Clark et al., 2010 - p. 403 ). We then formulated a second order interpretation of the informants' voices which referred to - but was not limited to - BusinessModel Innovation theory, possibly contributing to theory building. Although exploratory theory building research should start with little or no theory under consideration and no hypotheses to test - since“preordained theoretical perspectives or propositions may bias and limit the ﬁndings ”- according to Eisenhardt (1989 - p. 536) , it is vir- tually impossible to start with a “clear theoretical slate ”. Nonetheless, in an attempt to follow an exploratory approach coherently, we strivedto maintain a neutral point of view when asking our informants to re- member the BMI process they went through when their startup was in its early stages. In getting the multiple case study o ﬀthe ground, BMI theory was needed solely to act as a starting point to draw up a su ﬃ- ciently broad research question, and so initiate the data gathering process ( Eisenhardt, 1989; Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007). The in- formants were not exposed to any preordained relationships with othertheories or approaches, such as LSAs and AD, before or during the in- terviews. Case sampling was performed theoretically ( Eisenhardt, 1989; Meredith, 1998 ), and following our interpretive stance, cases were se- lected according to how heterogeneous they were in terms of two re-levant variables that could have had an in ﬂuence over the BMI process: (i) environmental dynamism - moderate or high; and (ii) the startup'srole in terms of being subject to or determining such dynamism. Fol- lowing this choice, we identi ﬁed three relevant cases concerning digital mobile platform startups that either operate in a moderately dynamicenvironment (Case A) or a highly
platform startups that either operate in a moderately dynamicenvironment (Case A) or a highly dynamic environment (Case B) to which they are subject, or in a highly dynamic environment determined by the digital startup itself (Case C). The level of environmental dy- namism and the digital startups' role within their environment were informed by the analysis of secondary sources, as suggested in Meredith (1998) . Despite competing in di ﬀerent industries - namely, home maintenance and repair services for Case A, cashless payments for Case B and accommodation services for Case C - a common factor for all three digital startups was that they operated a multisided platform business connecting di ﬀerent pools of customers ( Evans & Schmalensee, 2016 ;Gawer, 2014 ) and, having selected similar business approaches, it was easier to carry our comparisons and cross-case analysis. We opted for a multiple case study since this approach potentially reinforces the process of generalizing results ( McGrath, 2010 ;Meredith, 1998 ), while enabling a comparative analysis of the ﬁndings, because the theoretical sample can possibly include extreme cases, polar typesA. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 522
or niche situations ( Meredith, 1998 ). Despite this, the limited number of digital startups included in the sample allowed us to retain the po- sitive properties of a single case study methodology in terms of ac- quiring an extensive qualitative description and analysis of BMI in the early stages of the startups' development, together with the needed depth and insight, which is di ﬃcult to replicate on a wider sample (Handﬁeld & Melnyk, 1998). For all three cases, our unit of analysis was the early stage BMI process undertaken by each digital startup, with its steps and constituent elements as possible sub-units of analysis. 3.1. Data gathering In our multiple case study, data were collected through multiple sources of information ( Yin, 1984). Face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were the primary source of information. Because the interviews used in the data collection process were semi-structured, this meant that the interviewers could start from several key issues identi ﬁed from the research question - and so not risk leaving the interviewer at the interviewee's mercy - while allowing anyinnovative matter to emerge from the ensuing open discussion (Walsham, 1995 ;Yin, 1984). The researchers ﬁrst crafted and carried out two pilot interviews with two founders of a digital startup not included in the theoretical sample, known to the researchers from being involved in previous studies. The pilot interviews allowed us to con ﬁrm that the research questions and related sub-questions were clear to the informants andcould lead to insightful discussions - although the pilot informants'feedback did lead to minor changes in the wording of the questions to improve clarity. Following the pilot interviews, the researchers carried out thirteen semi-structured interviews over three distinct waves with the three digital startups in the theoretical sample.

in Case A took place between February and July 2015 with the four founders of the digital startup - the current Chief Executive O ﬃcer (CEO), Chief Operations O ﬃcer (COO), Chief Digital Oﬃcer (CDO) and Chief Financial O ﬃcer (CFO) (one interview each) - and its Marketing Vice President (two interviews). The four interviews in Case B took place between April and October 2017 with the three founders - the startup's CEO (two interviews), COO and CFO (one in- terview each). The three interviews in Case C took place between September and October 2017 with one of the startup's founders - its Chief Marketing O ﬃcer (CMO) - one Project Manager and one Product Specialist (one interview each). In Case C, one researcher was a parti-cipant observer at two strategic meetings between the CMO and his team, where they spent a total of 130 min covering the BMI process, allowing us to gain further understanding of the process under scrutiny. The interviews lasted between 70 and 90 min each, with an average of 84 min. The protocol of the interviews was consistent with the study's re- search question: the informants were asked to describe and comment on the Business Model Innovation process undertaken in their digital startup during the early stages of its development - where by early stage we mean the period when the startup's business model was undergoing its most signi ﬁcant innovations leading to its ﬁrst consolidation. In addition, the informants were invited to discuss the key steps in thisBMI process, as well as the constituent elements they dealt with and focused on. As a result, the interviews included a ﬁrst set of questions on the initial working version of their business model in the early stagesof its development (with questions like: “What was your value propo- sition? Who were your initial target customers? How did you organize your digital startup to create and deliver your value proposition to customers? Were you already making a pro ﬁt (i.e. capturing value)? If
your value proposition to customers? Were you already making a pro ﬁt (i.e. capturing value)? If yes, how? If not, why not? ”). These questions were based on the widely accepted conceptualization of a business model as the process whereby an organization creates, delivers and captures value ( Kulins, Leonardy, & Weber, 2016 ;Saebi, Lien, & Foss, 2017 ;Teece, 2010; Zott et al.,2011 ). Similarly, a second set of questions centred on the startup's current version of their business model, the one that emerged from theinnovation process. Then, based on Foss and Saebi's (2018) concepts on BMI, we devised a third set of questions to investigate the businessmodel's innovation steps and its process (including questions such as: “What are the main changes to your digital startup concerning the way you create, deliver and capture value? Why did you make thesechanges? ”). It is worth mentioning that, when tackling complex phenomena in their real-world context, it is very common for both the interviewers and the interviewees to unconsciously miss or neglect some points. To handle these observer biases ( Yin, 1984 ), we included the ﬁrst and second sets of questions, to obtain a clear picture of the business modelbefore and after the BMI process; these distinct and comparable sets of data on ex ante and ex post business models helped us to interact with the interviewees further, repeating the questions relating to evidentchanges in the BM that the interviewee had yet to mention. This combination of the ﬁrst, second and third sets of questions helped us to avoid missing any information on key BM changes. We concluded witha fourth and ﬁnal set of questions to ask about the approach that had guided the BMI process in terms of its steps and constituent elements(with questions like: “How did you identify the problem and the need for making changes to your previous BM con ﬁguration? How did you reach a solution? How did you know it was the right solution? Did you employ any
How did you reach a solution? How did you know it was the right solution? Did you employ any methodology, model, approach, tool or instrument to support and enable this process? Can you describe the di ﬃculties you had to manage during the process of identifying the problems andﬁnding a solution? How would you deﬁ ne the changes introduced to your innovated business model? Radical or incremental? What wouldyou say were the most critical steps, elements and concepts that best describe this process of Business Model Innovation within your early stage digital startup? ”). A detailed list of questions driving the semi- structured interviews is given in Appendix A . As case studies rely heavily on the correctness of the information provided by the interviewees for their validity and reliability, and these can be enhanced by using multiple sources or “looking at data in multiple ways ”(Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 2003 ), several secondary sources of evidence and archival data were also added to supplement the interview data, including business plans (one for each case); stra- tegic reports (one for Case A; two each for Cases B and C); informal e- mails (thirty-four for Case A; twenty- ﬁve for Case B; ﬁve for Case C); meeting minutes (six pages for Case A; twenty pages for Case B); in-ternet pages (sixteen for Case A; ﬁfteen for Case B; forty-two for Case C); newspaper articles (three for Case A; seven for Case B; twelve forCase C); and whitepapers (two for Case A; one for Case B; three for Case C). This array of sources led to “data  triangulation ”essential for qua- litative research to be trustworthy and persuasive ( Bonoma, 1985; Siggelkow, 2007 ). In view of the fact that, according to Yin (2013) , with respect to “operational procedures for carrying out triangulations [ …] no benchmarks exist to deﬁ ne when triangulation might be considered ‘strong’ or‘weak ’or‘complete ’or‘incomplete ’”(p. 324), we followed an iterative process, gathering and considering a ﬁrst set of
’”(p. 324), we followed an iterative process, gathering and considering a ﬁrst set of secondary sources before conducting the interviews, as well as assembling a second set of secondary sources that were cited or delivered by the informants during or right after the interviews. The data triangulation process considered all the secondary sources (i.e. data from interviews, participants' observations, archival data and external documents) ob- tained at di ﬀerent steps of the process - see Appendix B . 3.2. Data analysis The responses from the interviewees were recorded and fully tran- scribed. If any information was still unclear and/or more data was needed, the informants were later contacted by telephone to ask for clariﬁ cation.A. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 523
Then, following the recommendations of Eisenhardt (1989) ,a within-case data analysis was carried out to generate the necessary insight into the issues under scrutiny; a subsequent cross-case analysis allowed us to make a comparison between the di ﬀerent responses given by the informants from the three di ﬀerent startups. Concerning the within-case analysis, interview content analysis was performed by borrowing the open coding practice from GroundedTheory methodology ( Glaser & Strauss, 1967 ;Strauss & Corbin, 1998 ), a method suitable to study complex phenomena through a clearly de-ﬁned procedure based on coding - i.e. labels, concepts and words used to produce theory from interviews, rather than the mere ﬁnding of facts (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The empirical material was codi ﬁed through textual analysis, and archived using a software package. For each of the three cases, we built an inductive coding tree based on both “in vivo ”and constructed codes ( Glaser & Strauss, 1967), re- cording the exact wording used by the informants to describe the pro- cess being investigated, as well as the constructed wording induced by the researchers. The codes relating to the interviews for each startup were iteratively contrasted and compared in order to group them into sets of ﬁrst order concepts. These ﬁrst order concepts were then further grouped around a set of second order themes or categories, allowing usto view the data at a higher level of abstraction ( Clark et al., 2010 ). Eventually, as a third and concluding step, the second order themeswere grouped into overarching dimensions that captured the most im- portant steps and constituent elements in a BMI process. Through the inductive coding tree, ﬁne-grained in vivo codes were transformed into aggregated concepts, and the real-world content obtained from thequalitative interviews enabled us to proceed with the abstraction and theory building ( Saldaña, 2009). With reference to cross-case analysis, we looked for
and theory building ( Saldaña, 2009). With reference to cross-case analysis, we looked for similarities and diﬀerences between Cases A, B and C with reference to the ﬁrst order concepts, second order themes and, above all, the overarching dimen-sions ( Yin, 1984). This concluding procedure allowed us to contrast and compare the BMI process steps and constituent elements within the three very di ﬀerent digital startups under investigation, allowing us to make the best use of our multiple case study on Digital Entrepreneur-ship to “capture the novel ﬁndings that may appear in the data ” (Eisenhardt, 1989 - p. 541). To conclude, the case results were reviewed and con ﬁrmed by the interviewees, to potentially amend any error or bias and ultimatelyenhance the correctness of our interpretations. 4. Cases The multiple case studies relate to three digital startups undergoing early stage Business Model Innovation, heterogeneously positioned in terms of their environmental dynamism - moderate or high - and role in determining such dynamism. 4.1. Case A - moderate environmental dynamism imposed upon the digital startup Case A refers to a digital startup founded in 2011. The founders recognized the need for a two-sided platform capable of matching theoﬀer (i.e. from SMEs and individual providers) and demand (from private customers) for services and errands such as cleaning, housemaintenance and repairs. When private users post a request for a ser- vice or errand on Case A's platform, SMEs and individual providers viewing it can send a description of their services and relative quota- tions to their potential customers, who will then select the serviceprovider who o ﬀers the best service description-quotation trade-o ﬀ, activate the transaction and execute a payment; the startup receives aservice fee of between 5% and 7% for each transaction - this is the pay per transaction model. The digital startup operates in a moderately dynamic environment - that of traditional house
model. The digital startup operates in a moderately dynamic environment - that of traditional house maintenance and repairs services and errands -and, although it innovated its model, it did not dramatically reshape itsindustry or intensify the industry volatility and turbulence. In the early stages of its development, the digital startup went through several BMI cycles, which tackled di ﬀerent sides of its business model, with a focus on the mechanisms for capturing value. 4.2. Case B - high environmental dynamism imposed upon the digital startup Case B refers to a digital startup founded in 2013 that handles electronic payments between individuals and merchants. The platform allows end-users (buyers) to make feeless cashless micropayments, while it charges merchants (sellers) a ﬁxed fee for transactions of more than 10€. When users register on the platform, they are automaticallyassigned a virtual wallet; users can designate a weekly budget to be paid to the platform, and an algorithm automatically uses SSD (Single Europe Payment Area - SEPA - Direct Debit) to collect this sum from the user's bank account and place it in their virtual wallet. This weekly budget is capped at 200€. At the end of every week, the users' budget is automatically reset by collecting the amount spent or depositing the excess - built up whenever the user receives a peer-to-peer payment from other users. Considering the merchants' side, every night the platform makes an SCT (SEPA Credit Transfer) transaction to move the sums collected during the day directly into the merchants' bank ac- count. The startup's main strategic goal was to pursue fast growth, enabled by integrating the platform into di ﬀerent channels, thus allowing in- creased market coverage while facilitating its adoption by both usersand merchant - in line with its positioning as a two-sided platform. The startup illustrated in Case B operates in the “ﬁnancial tech- nology ”(or FinTech) industry, where digital technologies
in Case B operates in the “ﬁnancial tech- nology ”(or FinTech) industry, where digital technologies can enable innovation in the standard ﬁnancial services typically provided by banks and insurance companies. As a result, the ﬁnancial services in- dustry - with speci ﬁc reference to e-payments - has been the “land of conquest ”for many newcomers having to compete against each other as well as against the incumbent ﬁnancial services companies ( Mills & McCarthy, 2017), thereby increasing market turbulence. The digitalstartup investigated in Case B operates in a highly dynamic environ- ment (i.e. the e-payments sector), although this dynamism was the outcome of various macro-trends rather than the startup's own strategy and innovation; nevertheless, the startup was interested in innovating its BM with a focus on value delivery mechanisms, in order to adapt to and align itself with this highly dynamic environment. 4.3. Case C - high environmental dynamism determined by the digital startup Case C relates to a digital startup founded in 2007 that o ﬀers an accommodation booking service, whereby people can list, ﬁnd and book various types of accommodation - e.g. apartments, rooms, villas - around the world through their mobile phones or over the internet. The startup's original aim was to target and enter a niche market by re- designing the whole customer experience, allowing users to reserve accommodation in a few clicks using digital technologies. As a result, the founders created a two-sided platform capable of matching the o ﬀer (i.e. house-owners or hosts) and demand (i.e. private individuals orguests) for overnight stays in periods when hotels are potentially ex- pensive or hard to come by because of popular or busy events held inthe surrounding areas. Once private individuals have registered on the platform, they can easily ﬁnd and contact the best house-owners or hosts for their desired overnight stay. Considering the hosts' side, upon registration, house-owners
for their desired overnight stay. Considering the hosts' side, upon registration, house-owners can post a description of their o ﬀer and chat with potential guests, giving them more information about their ac-commodation. When the expectations of both sides of the platform - guest and host - are matched, the payment can be transferred through the platform, with the digital startup in Case C retaining a booking fee - a small percentage from the host and a bigger one from the guest.A. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 524
While the digital startup initially targeted a speci ﬁc niche, its in- novation proceedings eventually introduced a disruption to the entire accommodation industry. The startup's matching platform largely contributed to the uprise of the informal tourism accommodation market, directly in ﬂuencing other traditional competing o ﬀers from hotels and resorts. By redesigning the entire customer experience, thedigital startup helped to create a new standard for customer expecta- tions and satisfaction, a ﬀecting other traditional companies operating in the tourism market - e.g. traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies- which, in turn, found it di ﬃcult to adapt and exploit the opportunities deriving from digital technologies ( Candela & Figini, 2012; Kracht & Wang, 2010). As a result of the shakeout in the tourism sector induced by this digital startup, several incumbent businesses went bankrupt relatively abruptly, in line with the expected implications of the what is known as “big-bang disruption ”(Downes & Nunes, 2013). This dis- ruption came about through the digital startup's BMI, which largelyfocuses on radically new value creation mechanisms that triggered high environmental dynamism within the whole tourism industry. 5. Results In line with the methods presented in Section 3 , we have described the three inductive coding trees for the digital startups involved in our multiple case study. These representations allowed us to structure within-case results that converge towards the more theoretical over- arching dimensions or concepts. Table 1 shows the inductive coding tree for Case A, while the coding trees for Cases B and C are given in Appendix C . It is worth noting that Table 1 is not meant to be either a causal or a dynamic model in itself, but rather a representation of the core concepts and their relationships. These inductive coding trees were derived from the interviews' protocol discussed in Section 3.1 . More speci ﬁcally, for Case A, the ﬁrst order
the interviews' protocol discussed in Section 3.1 . More speci ﬁcally, for Case A, the ﬁrst order concepts and second order themes that determined the over-arching dimensions of value delivery and value capture largely derive from the semi-structured questions belonging to the ﬁrst three sets of questions - as reported in the Annex, while the content that had beenstructured during the overarching dimensions of experimenting and testing, operational agility and entrepreneurial and innovative organi- zational culture mostly come from the fourth set of questions. With reference to Case B and Case C, the content and overarching dimensions relating to value creation, value delivery and value capture came mainly from the ﬁrst three sets of questions, while most of the content relating to experimenting and testing, operational agility, strategicagility and entrepreneurial and innovative organizational culture was derived from the fourth set of questions on the BMI steps and its con- stituent elements. While the interviews' protocol and sequence of questions helped in crafting the study's results and the ensuing discussion, because the in- terviews were conducted in an open and semi-structured manner, it is not possible make a straightforward connection between every question and each coded concept, theme or dimension, as these results often originated in the combination of multiple answers to di ﬀerent ques- tions. A cross-case comparison was also performed to complement the within-case analysis and underscore the main similarities and di ﬀer- ences between the three cases and search for any patterns followed by the digital startups during their early stage Business Model Innovation process. In line with Eisenhardt (1989) , a cross-case analysis was conducted along two di ﬀerent strategies. First, the digital startups A, B and C were compared to examine the divergence between the two variables used in the theoretical sampling: (i) level of environmental dynamism - mod-
the two variables used in the theoretical sampling: (i) level of environmental dynamism - mod- erate to high - and (ii) role of the startup with reference to this dyna- mism - whether it had been imposed on or determined by the startup. Second, the cases were compared with reference to the ﬁrst orderconcepts, second order themes and, most importantly, overarching di-mensions, to identify any possible pattern match or mismatch: this was operationally achieved by merging the coding trees of the three cases. The cross-case analysis ultimately fed into a uni ﬁed framework to generate our propositions, and these could be used as a research agenda to investigate the relationships between Business Model Innovation, Lean Startup Approaches and Agile Development in varying combina- tions of environmental dynamism and the startup's relative role therein. 6. Discussion The exploratory multiple case study revealed several ﬁndings about how digital startups carry out Business Model Innovation in contexts where the levels of environmental dynamism vary as does the role played by the startup in determining this dynamism - or not. In an attempt to extract a contribution from our exploratory re- search for both theory and practice, our discussion will ﬁrst treat each case in isolation, elaborating on each coding tree and the relativewithin-case ﬁndings. Subsequently, the cross-case analysis will provide the basis for a reference framework and set forth a set of propositionsand resulting research agenda. 6.1. Discussion of within-case ﬁndings In Case A, the digital startup operates in an industry of moderate dynamism which the startup had no direct part in generating. During the early stages of its development, the startup touched upon allfoundational elements of a business model - as revealed by the over- arching dimensions of value creation, value delivery and value capture. Value creation consisted mostly of crafting a di ﬀerentiated o ﬀer that satisﬁed both sides of the platform
consisted mostly of crafting a di ﬀerentiated o ﬀer that satisﬁed both sides of the platform set up by the startup - a critical task for any multisided platform business ( Gawer, 2014 ) - and value delivery focused on managing multiple delivery channels, with the startupplaying an intermediary role between demand and o ﬀer, together with setting up the right strategic partnerships. The startup's focal innova-tion activity concerned its value capture proceedings. Informants fre- quently redirected the conversation towards their e ﬀorts to ﬁnd the right pricing strategy - e.g. fees for users and merchants, with the optionof both sides of the platform paying for the service -, introducing new revenue streams into their revenue models and properly balancing revenue with their cost structure. Not being forced to compete in a highly volatile environment, the digital startup concentrated its BMI on discovering the most pro ﬁtable mechanism to capture value. This was con ﬁrmed by the CEO: “Our business idea was clear to us ,as was how we were to deliver it .The real questions puzzling us in those ﬁrst months were :are users or merchants ,or users and merchants ,willing to pay for it? And how much? On top of that , we were trying to ﬁgure out the actual costs to build and maintain our platform ”. This close attention to the operation's economic and ﬁnancial via- bility was re ﬂected in the testing dimension: most testing - in terms of hypotheses, minimum viable product and metrics - were meant to va-lidate their assumptions on pricing, fee balancing and customer ac- quisition costs. All such assumptions were proved or disproved by carefully assessing customer feedback. The startup's positioning in a moderately dynamic industry, with little ambition to trigger dramatic changes, led to its strong commit- ment to operational agility, where Business Model Innovation had the function of ensuring constant operational alignment - with the COO having a key role in leading BMI - and
of ensuring constant operational alignment - with the COO having a key role in leading BMI - and managing its existing endow-ment of resources to meet the challenges and complexity of its internal and external environment. When managing projects, the startup also achieved agility in its operations and tactics by systematically in- troducing a number of agile and lean methods, like Scrum Sprints, use cases from the Rational Uni ﬁed Process (RUP) and Feature-Driven Development. As the COO stated, “being constantly ﬂexible, agile and leanA. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 525

when innovating our business model was a top priority for us ,and lean and agile tools and methods came in handy ”. This within-case ﬁnding con ﬁrms the fact that LSAs and AD methods are often tightly coupled and used jointly within the same organization. The main barriers to BMI mentioned by the interviewees referred to their tests on pricing and costs, con ﬁrming their marked focus on op- erating well-performing value capture mechanisms. A strong entrepreneurial and innovative organizational culture ran through the entire BMI process - traditionally a given for startups(Gartner, 1985 ) - manifesting itself through opportunity-seeking beha- vior, heavy reliance on the entrepreneurial team's leadership, thecreation of cross-functional teams collaborating with one another and informal ﬂows of communication. This clearly emerges from a story told by the co-founder about their regular “Saturday Future ”meeting: “every Saturday ,my co -founders and I meet for co ﬀee;we each then spend an hour alone thinking about our future as a company ,coming together to share and discuss our ideas about future opportunities and the challenges ahead ,as well as how we should grab these opportunities and tackle the challenges in the upcoming week .The whole thing lasts for a couple of hours. You may think that's too long for a co ﬀee[laughs], but it's how we keep our eyes and minds open to running our startup better ”. The digital startup illustrated in Case B faced a highly dynamic environment battered by technology innovation; the startup needed toadapt to - and possibly leverage on - this environmental turbulence. While all the business model's foundational elements were subject to innovation in the early stages of its development, the startup focused mainly on testing and changing its value delivery mechanisms. This included the actions of developing a user-friendly mobile app interface; carving out a position in the crowded competitive payment services arena by targeting
interface; carving out a position in the crowded competitive payment services arena by targeting micro-payments and transactions; ﬁlling a structural hole in the cashless payment value network ( Gulati, Nohria, & Zaheer, 2000 ) by connecting users and merchants directly; and obtaining all the necessary accreditations and o ﬃcial partnerships with formal institu- tions. Due to the dynamism of the environment in which the startup op- erates, it clearly intended to place itself within a network or ecosystemthat could enhance its position and advantage, while ensuring its ca- pacity to transfer value to customers, although the industry's “[…] winds of change blew in our faces all day and all night long ,and we had to ﬁnd some kind of ‘safe house ’to sit tight in :inﬁnancial services ,that meant getting as many accreditations as possible and building up strong partner-ships ”, as the CFO put it. Consistently with the goal of innovating its value delivery me- chanisms, the startup's testing was based on hypothesizing about the industry's future value network structure; evaluating the performance of the di ﬀerent channels; assessing customer feedback relating to the channels' conversion rates; and focusing on local areas to increasedensity, penetration and network e ﬀects. Although the digital startup did not trigger the market dynamism, this situation called for agility at both operational and strategic levels when proceeding with BMI. The startup's operational agility relied on several factors. These included exploiting the synergies both within the technology infra- structure and among the salesforce involved in propelling the mer- chants' adoption of the service; properly orchestrating their existing resources derived from ﬁnancial technologies; quickly adapting to FinTech trends; and leveraging on a combination of agile and leanapproaches. The highest operational barriers to BMI encountered by the startup referred to organizational and compliance issues, in line with
to BMI encountered by the startup referred to organizational and compliance issues, in line with its strategic objective to ﬁnd its place in the marketspace. In parallel, a certain level of strategic agility was needed to deal with this dynamicenvironment, in terms of reinventing traditional ways of doing things by exploiting digital technologies in an original manner; and setting up an alternative to the traditional banking and payment system, one diﬃcult for competitors to replicate. When it came to strategic agility, the startup worked hard to adjust to emerging trends and evolvingcustomer needs, consistently with how companies immersed in chaoticenvironments should act, according to Fartash, Davoudi, and Semnan (2012) and Weber and Tarba (2014) . Interestingly, when discussing BMI and the need to be strategically agile, our informants often referred to Lean Startup and Customer Development approaches. As the CEO put it,“when dealing with changing trends and customer expectations ,Lean Startup and Customer Development (we actually see them as pretty much overlapping in some of their phases )helped us to learn and pivot fast ;scale fast if the innovation we wanted to implement was ok ;or fail fast if it was a mistake nobody liked or cared for ”. All of these actions were enabled by an organization sporting a clear vision, where the founders had strong control over their strategies and operations, with highly skilled cross-functional teams and a preference for informal communication ﬂowing both top-down and bottom-up. As the COO said, “it is still relatively easy for me and my co -founders to meet our employees every day ,and is a no -brainer if you want to understand what's going on in your organization and want to move forward consistently , despite all the mess we are regularly coming up against ”. In Case C, the digital startup's BMI determined the high dynamism of its environment. In the early stages of its development, the startup's value delivery and
of its environment. In the early stages of its development, the startup's value delivery and capture mechanisms were both subject to innova- tion. Rather than focusing on a well-performing pro ﬁt formula or de- signing suitable ways to transfer value for its matchmaking platform-based services value, the innovation e ﬀort targeted value creation. During his interview, the founder reinforced this idea many times: “At that time,the other members of the team and I knew that there was some- thing wrong with the [accommodation ]industry ,but we had little idea of what to do to make things better for both guests and hosts .[…]We kept on wondering how to create a di ﬀerent experience .[…]Our problem was that the hotel market was there :but it was not the market we had in mind …we had to make things di ﬀerent, way di ﬀerent, and we needed to ﬁgure out how ”. Introducing actual disruption through BMI requires a great e ﬀort to converge on value proposition innovation, and so come up withsomething both e ﬃcient and e ﬀective - in line with the big-bang dis- ruption tenets that claim to break the cost-value trade o ﬀ, by leveraging on inexpensive technologies to drop costs, while recombining them in an original way to increase value ( Downes & Nunes, 2013 ). Therefore, tests were run based on di ﬀerent assumptions about how to generate alternative sources of value for property owners and renters, which departed radically from the current accommodation business status quo. Operational agility was a constituent element of the startup's BMI process - in the form of e ﬃciently managing the existing pool of re- sources and a combination of agile and lean methods to run projects inshort iterations. This was reinforced by the Product Specialist: “we used Lean Startup extensively together with several agile methods like Scrum andFDD,because they tell you how not to waste resources ;considering that we had so few resources at that time ,it made total sense not to waste them …”. The
that we had so few resources at that time ,it made total sense not to waste them …”. The main operational BMI barrier was related to engaging new custo- mers and onboarding them so that they could start their customer journey with a radically new value proposition and experience. However, the core part of the startup's BMI referred to strategic agility, where the startup was concerned with ﬁghting with well-entrenched incumbents in possession of strong resources - e.g. brand, customerbase, marketing budget, ﬁnancial resources, track record. To achieve this, it created an innovative value system based on complex inter-connections of assets, know-how and relationships that, in turn, could generate a defensible competitive advantage. Rather than striving to maintain internal consistency, within its BMI process, the startup created tensions that tended to break the con- sistency of its business model elements, with its ultimate objective being to trigger industry-wide disruption. The resulting business model was constantly under pressure, “stressed  and stretched ”in the words of the Product Specialist. This was the toll the startup had to pay for its attempt to induceA. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 527
discontinuous innovation. Again, quoting one of the founders: “If you plan to radically change a whole market, and you don't really know how ,the only things you should do are to keep looking ,keep listening ,keep learning and be able to disrupt yourself any time you have the chance ”. This ap- proach is quite an accurate representation of what Doz and Kosonen (2008, 2010) described as strategic sensitivity, which they deﬁ ned as the sharpness of perception of, and the intensity of awareness and at- tention to, strategic developments, which lead to experimenting, dis- tancing an organization from its original business model and reframing it in the light of what is learned through experiments. This case shares a similar organizational structure and culture fa- voring entrepreneurial and innovative behavior with the two previous cases and, in addition, it places signi ﬁcant emphasis on the founding members' leadership, foresight and enlightenment, on introducing in-centives for risk-taking and assigning a primary role to knowledge generated through customer feedback. 6.2. Discussion of cross-case ﬁndings: uni ﬁed framework and developing a research agenda Through the cross-case analysis, we were able to obtain an overall view of the ﬁndings that had emerged from the exploratory multiple case study. In the attempt to o ﬀer a vivid picture of these multidimensional ﬁndings, and so develop both our propositions and research agenda, we built a uni ﬁed framework to organize the results into the sets of vari- ables, dimensions and domains discussed in this study. First, we con- sidered the two elements used to theoretically sample early stage digital startups and increase the heterogeneity of the cases: (i) moderate or low level of environmental dynamism; and (ii) the startup's role in terms ofwhether it was subject to or had determined this dynamism. Second, we included the seven overarching dimensions that emerged from the in- ductive coding trees of the three cases: (1)
seven overarching dimensions that emerged from the in- ductive coding trees of the three cases: (1) Value Capture; (2) Value Delivery; (3) Value Creation; (4) Testing; (5) Operational Agility; (6) Strategic Agility; and (7) Entrepreneurial and Innovative Organizational Culture. Third, we introduced three domains involvingconcepts, constructs and approaches, linked by the relationship that we wished to explore inductively in this study, namely: (A) Business Model Innovation; (B) Lean Startup Approaches; and (C) Agile Development. The resulting uniﬁ ed framework is shown in Fig. 1, where all ele- ments listed above are identi ﬁed by their name and label in brackets. With regards to the sampling variables in the cases, as suggested by Eisenhardt (1989) , we intersected them to design a map where the axes indicate the level of dynamism and digital startup's role; each variableor axis can take two levels - moderate or high, and indicate for each whether the startup is subject to dynamism or determines such dyna- mism. The resulting space shows where our Cases A, B and C were positioned, allowing for cross-case comparisons. It is useful to note that the intersection of these two variables and their associated levels does not immediately lead to a 2 × 2 matrix, since the thresholds separating the diﬀerent levels are blurred and, in the real-world, positioning can be to some extent fuzzy - and deﬁ ning such thresholds lies outside the objectives of this study. As a second step in building the framework, we charted the seven overarching dimensions which had emerged from the exploratory re- search on the three cases. All the constituent elements of a business model, i.e. value creation, delivery and capture, were at the core of the early stage BMI process carried out by the startups, as has clearly emerged from our interviews - with speci ﬁc reference to the ﬁrst, second and third sets of questions set out in Appendix A .

third sets of questions set out in Appendix A .  This con ﬁrms that, even in the ﬁeld of digital startups and with reference to the early stages of their development, the business model is ultimately intendedto be a value architecture ( Foss & Saebi, 2018 ;Ghezzi et al., 2015; Teece, 2010 ). Building on this ﬁnding, we set forth the following pro- position: Proposition 1. Early stage Business Model Innovation for digital startups revolves around the value architecture elements of value creation, value delivery and value capture. Although all startups strived to innovate all of their business models' fundamental elements, the relevant insight comes from the di ﬀerent emphases put on the process: Case A - where the startup was subject toDIGITAL  STARTUP’S  ROLE (ii) L Y T I C I M A N Y D G N I N I M R E T E D Y T I C I M A N Y D O T T C E J B U S ENVIRONMENTAL  DYNAMICITY LEVEL (i)MODERATE DYNAMICITY HIGH DYNAMICITYOPERATIONAL AGILITY (5)STRATEGIC AGILITY (6) BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION (A)ENTREPRENEURIAL AND INNOVATIVE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE (7) AGILE DEVELOPMENT (C)VALUE  CAPTURE  (1)LEAN STARTUP  APPROACHES (B) VALUE  DELIVERY (2)VALUE  CREATION (3) EXPERIMENTING &  TESTING (4) Fig. 1.

moderate dynamism - focused on value capture, caused by its need to improve its viability in a relatively stable environment that it did not wish to modify in any discontinuous measure; Case B operated under the conditions where the high and uncontrollable environmental vola- tility forced the startup to embed itself deeply into a network and/or ecosystem of partnerships, while trying to transfer value to its custo- mers; and Case C exempli ﬁed a condition where a traditional market is disrupted by the Business Model Innovation introduced by the startup,which had concentrated on ﬁnding an original and ground-breaking way of creating customer value. Based on these aspects, we specifyProposition 1 as follows: Proposition 1(a). The emphasis of the Business Model Innovation process for early stage digital startups varies according to the level of environmental dynamism and the startup's role in being subject to or determining this dynamism. When the degree of dynamism is moderateand imposes itself on the startup, the startup's focus is on value capture; when the degree of dynamism is high and imposes itself on the startup, the focus is on value delivery; when the degree of dynamism is high and the startup has itself determined this condition, the focus is on value creation. The study also revealed how the BMI of early stage digital startups revolves around the dimension of experimenting and testing - mostly relating to the fourth set of questions listed in Appendix A . All startups relied heavily on formulating hypotheses, setting metrics, iteration andpivoting, involving the overall business model - rather than products and services. This leads to an additional proposition: Proposition 2. Experimenting and testing the overall business model, rather than products and services, is a core step of Business Model Innovation in early stage digital startups. Another insightful ﬁnding derived from the multiple case study, and one that makes it stand out for its implicit
ﬁnding derived from the multiple case study, and one that makes it stand out for its implicit theoretical contribution, islinked to the ensuing emergence of the operational and Strategic Agility dimensions. These dimensions concern the di ﬀerent focus and tensions that digital startups need to orchestrate when the external and internalconditions - i.e. dynamism and the startup's role - changed. Operational agility mostly referred to implementing agile and lean methods and practices that allow the startups to properly orchestrate their existing pool of resources, adapting them to external complexities; the ultimate goal being to maintain internal consistency. This is aligned with Foss and Saebi's (2018) assertion that BMI should deal with co- ordinating an intricate set of complementarities and synergies betweenthe various resources and activities. The need for operational agility is more evident in Cases A and B, where the startups took a more passive role concerning environmental change, thus showing a rather inward- facing focus. Strategic Agility is deﬁ ned as “the ability to continuously adjust and adapt strategic direction in core business, as a function of strategic ambitions and changing circumstances, and create not just new product and services, but also new business models and innovative ways to create value for a company ”(Doz & Kosonen, 2008 ). This notion was set out as being the thoughtful and purposive interplay between threemeta-capabilities carried out by top management: (i) strategic sensi- tivity, that is, the sharpness of perception of, and the intensity of awareness and attention to, strategic developments; (ii) resource ﬂuidity, that is, the internal capability to recon ﬁgure capabilities and redeploy resources rapidly; and (iii) leadership unity, that is, the abilityof the top management team to make bold, quick decisions ( Doz & Kosonen, 2008, 2010 ;Vecchiato, 2015 ;Weber & Tarba, 2014 ). Startup B and Startup C in particular show signi
2010 ;Vecchiato, 2015 ;Weber & Tarba, 2014 ). Startup B and Startup C in particular show signi ﬁcant alignment between the constituent elements of their BMI processes and the way they conceiveStrategic Agility: both startups operated in a highly dynamic environ- ment, and used strategic sensitivity, resource ﬂuidity and leadership unity to set up new value systems and business models to navigatethrough the market.Case C proved that strategically agile behavior is key to playing an active role in a disruption: the informants underscored how sensingnew strategic opportunities, creating new resources and ultimately triggering complexity - rather than simply managing it - were essentialin their early stage BMI. Intriguingly, in Case C, BMI largely consisted of constantly creating internal tensions that could break resource stabilityand business model complementarities, enabling the recombination and renewal of resources; these tensions could then propagate to the ex- ternal environment and determine the big-bang disruption's singularity (Downes & Nunes, 2013 ). Certainly, our research found that operational and Strategic Agility may coexist - as shown in Fig. 1, where the dotted boxes representing these two overarching dimensions overlap to a large extent; however, inthe agility continuum, we experience a gradual shift from operational to Strategic Agility as we move towards the top-right corner of our fra- mework, that is, where dynamism and the startup's active role in its determination both increase. The inclusion of operational and Strategic Agility in our framework allows us to produce the following propositions: Proposition 3. Business Model Innovation for early stage digital startups entails a combination of operational and Strategic Agility.Proposition 3(a). The lower the environmental dynamism and the more passive the role of the early stage digital startup having to cope with this dynamism, the greater the emphasis, within the BMI process, on operational
having to cope with this dynamism, the greater the emphasis, within the BMI process, on operational agility. Proposition 3(b). The higher the environmental dynamism and the more active the role of the early stage digital startup having to cope with this dynamism, the greater the emphasis, within the BMI process, on Strategic Agility. Proposition 3(c). The greater the emphasis placed on operational agility, the more BMI processes in early stage digital startups will focus on managing their existing resource endowment; maintaining their business model's internal consistency and complementarities; and managing complexity. Proposition 3(d). The greater the emphasis placed on Strategic Agility, the more BMI processes in early stage digital startups will focus on creating and recombining new resources; constantly creating internal tensions that break the business model's internal consistency and complementarities; and triggering complexity. The cross-case analysis also showed a pattern common to all the startups, in the form of a strong entrepreneurial and innovative orga-nizational culture, supported by clear vision, the founders' driving role, cross-functional and multidimensional teams and informal, and cus- tomer feedback-centric information ﬂows. This dimension constitutes a contextual factor that permeates throughout the whole framework. Inline with this, we propose the following: Proposition 4. A strong Entrepreneurial and Innovative organizational culture fosters BMI in early stage digital startups, irrespectively of the level of environmental dynamism and the role played by the startup has when faced with this dynamism. Beyond the seven overarching dimensions, we enriched the frame- work by including the three domains whose relationships we were ex- ploring: (A) Business Model Innovation; (B) Lean Startup Approaches; and (C) Agile Development. These domains frequently emerged during our interviews, with speci ﬁc reference to the question on the metho- dology,
emerged during our interviews, with speci ﬁc reference to the question on the metho- dology, model, approach, tool or instrument used to support and enablethe BMI process, as well as that on the primary steps, elements and concepts that best describe BMI (see Appendix A ). BMI, which acts as our driving research question for all our cases, spans across the whole map, although its distinctive features emerge more clearly when the dynamism and the startup's active role both increase (Case C), and we move towards Strategic Agility. Naturally,A. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 529
BMI encompasses the dimensions of value creation, delivery and cap- ture - as well as that of testing the business model's constituent ele- ments. Concerning AD, the interviews and the archival data underscore how the digital startups actually leveraged on Agile Development methods for their daily project management operations. Our informants frequently mentioned a number of terms explicitly - and we collected them as both in vivo and constructed codes -, having drawn them from their adoption of agile methods, such as “sprints ”and Scrum ( Schwaber & Sutherland, 2011 ), Feature-Driven Development ( Palmer & Felsing, 2001 ), and Adaptive Software Development ( Highsmith, 2000 ). The adoption of AD is more apparent in Cases A and B, where the startup isonly subject to environmental change; moreover, our ﬁndings indicate that agile methods still act on the business model's dimensions of value,but chie ﬂy in an operational, incremental and tactical way. Agile De- velopment hence largely falls into the area of operational agility. To assess the role and positioning of startups in Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs), we took into account the fact that all informantsexplicitly mentioned that LSAs had been adopted when undertaking BMI proceedings, and that they indicated testing as being an over- arching dimension of the BMI process. Since experimenting on the business model is at the heart of Lean Startup Approaches, LSAs are considered to be a method to support entrepreneurs in their BMI en- deavors. At the same time, when the informants described how they use agile methods to support their operational testing, they also mentioned lean principles. Within our ﬁndings, several touchpoints emerge that connect LSAs and AD: for instance, the concept of MVP (MinimumViable Products) in LSAs is consistent with the agile principle of minimum upfront planning; similarly, AD and LSAs share the iterative “feedback and change ”process, which should involve customers ac- tively in the
share the iterative “feedback and change ”process, which should involve customers ac- tively in the testing phase. As a result, our exploration allowed us to infer that BMI, LSAs and AD are indeed related, and LSAs belong to both the BMI and AD ﬁelds, thus representing an area where these domains connect and overlap. We then argue that Lean Startup Approaches stand at the crossroads of Business Model Innovation and Agile Development, and are a form ofthe agile methods that can be applied to products, services, value propositions andwhole business models. The tight connection we found between lean and agile was already pointed at by extant literature: for instance, Smits (2007) argued that the future of agile methods lies in its origins, that is, lean principles; andSerignese (2010) wrote that lean is both the precursor and the future of agile. Our study contributes to extending such connections, by focusingon the LSAs-AD relationship and moving it from the domain of opera- tions to that of strategy, using BMI as a leit-motif and common unit of analysis. In the light of the arguments provided, we advance the following propositions: Proposition 5. In the context of early stage digital startups, the concepts and constructs used in Lean Startup Approaches stand at the crossroads of Business Model Innovation and Agile Development. Proposition 5(a). In the context of early stage digital startups, Lean Startup Approaches are a form of Agile Development applied to products, services, value propositions and whole Business Model Innovation. In addition to the above discussion, we suggest that LSAs also cut across operational and Strategic Agility, providing entrepreneurs with aset of concepts and constructs to orchestrate the tensions between using existing scarce resources to the best advantage and constantly renewing and recombining new and existing resources into other, original ones (Teece, 2007 ). This consideration is reformulated in the following propositions:
original ones (Teece, 2007 ). This consideration is reformulated in the following propositions: Proposition 6. In the context of early stage digital startups, the concepts and constructs used in Lean Startup Approaches cut acrossoperational and Strategic Agility.Proposition 6(a). In the context of early stage digital startups, adopting Lean Startup Approaches helps to orchestrate the tensions arising from concurrently managing the startup's existing endowment of resources and recombining them into new and original resources. To summarize, clarifying the relationship between BMI, LSAs and AD opens up a number of opportunities for cross-fertilization between theseﬁelds and the associated concepts and constructs. While having no ambition to be exhaustive, we point to the four directions mentionedin our introduction ( Section 1) and literature review ( Section 2). First, by linking BMI research to LSAs, this could help to solve the paradig-matic problem that weighs on Business Model Innovation theory ( Foss & Saebi, 2018 ), inviting BMI researchers to accrue cumulative empirics through LSA cases: for instance, the metrics for measuring BMI could mirror the LSA metrics found in the startups' cases. This cross-fertili- zation could be bidirectional, as the LSAs could explicitly include BMI concepts, such as the notion of complementarity between the business models' di ﬀerent constituent elements - thus encouraging the design of MVPs that could be tested for more hypotheses and BM parameters atthe same time. Second, recognizing how BMI and LSAs are related could provide further evidence that the business model concept is shifting to include demand-side value ( Massa et al., 2016). This theory is fully aligned and consistent with LSAs, where a value proposition can bedesigned and innovated on the basis of demand-side elements - e.g. the customer's perception of value. Third, BMI research could look for a strategic application of other agile methods beyond lean, thus ex-
BMI research could look for a strategic application of other agile methods beyond lean, thus ex- tending the range of applications for AD, a point currently under question ( Cooper & Sommer, 2016 ). Fourth, Agile Development could possibly expand and deepen its theoretical foundations by taking ele-ments from the Business Model Innovation and the Strategic Agility streams. 7. Conclusions This study investigated how digital startups in the early stages of their development engage with Business Model Innovation, in contexts with di ﬀerent levels of environmental dynamism and where the startups take on changing roles, in terms of whether they determinesuch dynamism or not. More speci ﬁcally, we designed a multiple case study to explore whether BMI is related with Lean Startup Approachesand Agile Development, and how environmental dynamism and/or the startup's role therein can in ﬂuence this relationship. Like all research attempting to frame reality in a model, our study is not free from limitations. These for the most part depend on: the pe- culiarity of the context under examination - digital startups in the early stages of their development - as well as the small sample size, which could limit the generalization and relevance of our ﬁndings; and the observer bias typical of qualitative studies, which could lead to the lossof valuable information and insight and is dependent on several factors - e.g. the informants' poor understanding of the researchers' questions and their inaccurate recollection of events -; and the researchers' in- ability to properly grasp, interpret and inductively aggregate the in- formation provided by the informants. Concerning the ﬁrst limitation, we started from the assumption that early digital startups could providea relatively novel case within a fast-growing empirical ﬁeld where we could adventure into BMI, LSAs and AD processes and relations. Havingsaid this, future studies should try to replicate our research in di ﬀerent and
relations. Havingsaid this, future studies should try to replicate our research in di ﬀerent and possibly more mature contexts, with broader theoretical or evenstatistical samples. With regards to the second limitation, our relianceon a well-established method, which we applied throughout the data collection and analysis steps, has possibly helped to enhance the soundness of our qualitative exploration into how the lean and agile Business Model Innovation unfolds. Despite its limitations, this study contributes to both theory and practice in multiple ways.A. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 530
Our work provides value for theory insomuch as it delivers a uni ﬁed framework that connects BMI, LSAs and AD - as well as their main steps and constituent elements - to operational and Strategic Agility ( Doz & Kosonen, 2008, 2010). Adding to the current research stream on how tobuild Strategic Agility from a resources and capabilities perspective (Battistella, De Toni, De Zan, & Pessot, 2017; Johnston, 2009 ;Teece, 2007 ), we argue that the approaches and methods discussed for LSAs and AD may be used to adequately orchestrate and manage the startup's extant resource endowment, or stimulate the creation of new resources by recombining resources di ﬀerently. Hence, BMI in a Strategic Agility framework can fruitfully draw on Agile Development and Lean StartupApproaches to nurture Doz and Kosonen's (2008) meta-capabilities of strategic sensitivity, resource ﬂuidity and leadership unity. Through our framework, we claim that Lean Startup Approaches can be perceived as a form of Agile Development operating at the levelof strategy and business models. In other words, LSAs are agile methods for Business Model Innovation. We hence explicitly embed the roots and antecedents of the practitioner-oriented LSAs in the Business Model Innovation and Agile Development ﬁelds of research. Because theo- rizing on common practices among practitioners - and LSAs are widelydiﬀused within the digital entrepreneur community - is typically a complex process ( Delery & Doty, 1996), discussing the antecedents and identifying the shared themes that connect these practices to other more established research streams - such as BMI, AD and Strategic Agility - is crucial when attempting to construct theoretical foundations (e.g. see Baker, 2007 ;Damanpour & Aravind, 2012; Lukas, Hult, & Ferrell, 1996 ;Agarwal & Malhotra, 2005 ).This study is a ﬁrst step towards building theory on LSAs, and opens up a promising research avenue that will call for further academic contribution. In order to pave the
a promising research avenue that will call for further academic contribution. In order to pave the way for future studies and foster cumulative theorizing, we also develop a set of propositions that can act as a research agenda, and point towards the opportunity of com- plementing knowledge in the BMI, LSAs and AD ﬁelds. The resulting value for practice takes the form of identifying the core steps and constituent elements that digital entrepreneurs should consider carefully and deploy in the early stages of their startup's de- velopment. Learning how these steps and the elements of value crea- tion, delivery and capture become more or less relevant as the context changes can help entrepreneurs to direct their e ﬀorts and allot their traditionally scarce resources e ﬀectively. Moreover, by recognizing that they can select from a pool of combinable lean and agile approaches and methods - e.g. MVP and minimal upfront testing; iterative “feed- back and change ”loops; and Scrum's sprints to restrict the duration of MVP testing by introducing a time box - to support innovation not only to their products, but also to their business model, o ﬀers digital en- trepreneurs a wider range of operational and strategic options that canbe put to use in the practice of both operational and Strategic Agility.

A set of pragmatic methods drawing on lean and agile principles has recently been proposed to support digital entrepreneurs facing Business Model Innovation (BMI), known as Lean StartupApproaches (LSAs). However, the theoretical and practical relationship between BMI and LSAs in dynamic di- gital environments has seldom been investigated. To ﬁll this gap, our study draws on an exploratory multiple- case study based on three digital multisided platform startups to craft a uni ﬁed framework that can disclose the relationship between BMI, LSAs and Agile Development (AD), within the context of Strategic Agility. Our ﬁn- dings, which emerge from the uni ﬁed framework, show that LSAs can be employed as agile methods to enable Business Model Innovation in Digital Entrepreneurship. These ﬁndings are then organized around a set of propositions, with the aim of developing a research agenda directed towards integrating BMI, LSAs and AD processes and methods. 1. Introduction In the early stages of their development, new ventures and startups frequently undergo change and innovation ( McDougall & Oviatt, 1996 ), because of their need to tackle resource scarcity and align their internal acquired resources to the external conditions ( Hanlon & Saunders, 2007 ;Katila & Shane, 2005 ). This is particularly true for --- conditions ( Hanlon & Saunders, 2007 ;Katila & Shane, 2005 ). This is particularly true for startups op- erating in a dynamic and uncertain digital context ( Courtney, Kirkland, & Viguerie, 1997; Sirmon, Hitt, & Ireland, 2007), where the impact of pervasive and multipurpose digital technologies increases the pace of change, leading to signi ﬁcant transformations in a number of industries (Bharadwaj, El Sawy, Pavlou, & Venkatraman, 2013 ;Ghezzi, Cortimiglia, & Frank, 2015 ;Kalakota & Robinson, 1999). Within such a dynamic context, innovating is an intricate exercise that demands idiosyncratic and seemingly divergent approaches and tools which digital startups can select as required, depending on the direction they intend to take when embarking upon their innovation process. We argue that the theoretical and practical relationship between these approaches and tools is worth investigating, and should speci ﬁ- cally examine the way in which early stage digital startups innovatetheir business model by leveraging on emerging agile and lean prac- tices. Innovation in early stage digital startups moves along two di ﬀerentalbeit intertwined paths: (i) innovation necessary to modify and adapt their products, services and value proposition to changing internal and/ or market conditions - and mostly refers to the process of New Product Development (NPD) ( Brown & Eisenhardt, 1995 ;Krishnan & Ulrich, 2001 ); and (ii) innovation to their business model - i.e. the overall value architecture and related mechanisms they set around their value pro- position to generate value for target customers, place such value on the market and retain part of it to ensure economic and ﬁnancial viability (Rappa, 2001; Teece, 2010 ;Timmers, 1998; Weill & Vitale, 2013 ). This second path expands the concept of NPD to embrace the fragmented but rapidly growing research stream and practice onBusiness Model Innovation (BMI) ( Schneider & Spieth, 2013 ;Teece, 2010 ;Zott, Amit, & Massa, 2011), referred --- Innovation (BMI) ( Schneider & Spieth, 2013 ;Teece, 2010 ;Zott, Amit, & Massa, 2011), referred to as the design and in- troduction of “novel, non-trivial changes to the key elements of a ﬁrm's business model and/or the architecture linking these elements ”(Foss and Saebi, 2018, p. 201). Although NPD and BMI research streams and practices should inherently be related, so far they have evolved in a largely disconnected fashion. In their path to bring about product, service and value proposition innovation, startups operating in this digital age can exploit a number of approaches that fall under the domain of agile methods. Within this group, Agile Development (AD) refers to practices for software devel- opment based on the centrality of individuals and interaction, incre- mental delivery of working software, collaboration with customers and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.06.013 Received 1 February 2017; Received in revised form 18 June 2018; Accepted 19 June 2018⁎Corresponding author.

With reference to the second path, the question of how to innovate a digital startup's overall business model - which includes and comple- ments its value proposition ( Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010 ;Teece, 2010 ) - was recently tackled through a set of pragmatic approaches referred toas the Lean Startup ( Ries, 2011 ) and Customer Development ( Blank, 2013 ). Both of these Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs) were conceived as a means to support entrepreneurs in the process of validating and in- novating their business model ( Trimi & Berbegal-Mirabent, 2012 ) through market tests and early customer feedback, thus triggering aprocess known as the “build-measure-learn ”loop ( Blank, 2013 ;Ries, 2011 ). Despite being wide-spread throughout the entrepreneurial community ( Maurya, 2012 ;Yang, Sun, & Zhao, 2018), LSAs' academic relevance and soundness is still met with scepticism among scholars. Asa result, there is as yet no strong theoretical foundation for these ap- proaches in the literature, although it would be of great help for ac- cumulating knowledge in the ﬁeld. With reference to the theoretical underpinnings and antecedents, Ries (2011) andBlank (2013) clearly connect LSAs with “lean philo- sophy ”- and its ﬁrst application in the manufacturing world ( Womack & Jones, 1997 ) - by deﬁ ning LSAs as a startup's attempts to cut its waste, understood as all its operations and processes which the targetcustomer does not want or does not ask for ( Blank, 2013 ;Ries, 2011 ); however, such connection has never been deeply or thoroughly in-vestigated. A similar problem emerges concerning the relationship between LSAs and Agile Development methods, where this link, despite poten- tially being intuitive ( Blank, 2013 ), is seldom elaborated on further. Extant research in the manufacturing ﬁeld proposes a “leagile ”method --- seldom elaborated on further. Extant research in the manufacturing ﬁeld proposes a “leagile ”method that crosses agile with lean philosophies (e.g. see Naylor, Naim, & Berry, 1999; Mason-Jones, Naylor, & Towill, 2000 ;Agarwal, Shankar, & Tiwari, 2006), although this discussion does not touch upon LSAs -probably because of the recent and as yet non-systematic application of these principles to the domains of strategy, entrepreneurship and in- novation. Moreover, while there appears to be an explicit link between the process of iteration carried out on the business model components and mechanisms set out in LSAs and the process of Business ModelInnovation, this relationship is seldom recognized within the relatively fragmented literature on BMI, which still su ﬀers from paradigmatic problems ( Foss & Saebi, 2018 ;Zott et al., 2011 ). The proliferation of di ﬀerent practices that can possibly help en- trepreneurs in their innovation endeavors, together with the substantiallack of a clear and uniﬁ ed theory backing such practices, together contribute towards creating a rather confusing setting that ampli ﬁes the problems that startups are already having to face, thus jeopardizing their quest for survival. These considerations are even more relevant in the context of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems ( Cavallo, Ghezzi, & Balocco, 2018; Nambisan, 2017), where digital startups have to cope with environ-mental dynamism that either forces them to adapt their business model to the volatile environment in which they operate, or o ﬀers them the chance to innovate their business model and so trigger more dynamicphenomena ( Downes & Nunes, 2013 ). This study aims at positioning our contribution at the crossroads of the above discussions and gaps in theory and practice, by exploring how LSAs act as agile methods for Business Model Innovation in Digital Entrepreneurship. To this end, we will design an exploratory multiple case study based on three digital startups, using it to --- end, we will design an exploratory multiple case study based on three digital startups, using it to investigate: (i) whether and how BMI carried out by early stage digital multisided platform startups in moderately or highly dynamic environments is related to LSAs and AD; and (ii) whether and how the focus of BMI processes - in terms of its steps and constituent elements - changes when considering amoderately dynamic environment (Case A) or a highly dynamic en- vironment in which the digital startup operates (Case B), or a highly dynamic environment determined by the digital startup itself (Case C). Our study will contribute to both theory and practice in a number of ways. First, we found that LSAs are tightly connected to agile methods and, as a result, we claim that LSAs can be understood as a form of Agile Development applied to products, services, value propositions and whole business models. This argument adds to the open debate cur-rently questioning the range of application for agile practices in busi- ness and management ( Cooper & Sommer, 2016 ). Second, according to our reasoning, LSAs are agile methods for Business Model Innovation,and therefore the theoretical foundations of LSAs are grounded in the BMIﬁeld. Third, we have developed a uniﬁ ed framework and set of propositions that connect Business Model Innovation, Lean StartupApproaches and Agile Development and position this relationship within the context of Strategic Agility. Fourth, concerning practice, digital entrepreneurs may ﬁnd our framework and propositions useful while designing and innovating their business models under varyingconditions of environmental dynamism and with the startup taking on diﬀerent roles when confronting or determining these conditions. The remainder of the study is organized as follows. In Section 2,w e illustrate the theoretical background at the basis of our investigation. In Section 3, we describe the research design and the cases, then presented inSection 4; and in --- In Section 3, we describe the research design and the cases, then presented inSection 4; and in Sections 5 and 6 we show and discuss the results of our empirical analysis. Finally, in Section 7, we draw the conclusions, opening the avenues for further research. 2. Theory 2.1. Business Model Innovation The research stream of Business Models and Business Model Innovation (BMI) springs from a combination of various Strategic Management theories, such as transaction cost economics, resource- based views of a ﬁrm, system theory and strategic network theory ( Amit & Zott, 2001 ;Hedman & Kalling, 2001 ;Morris, Schindehutte, & Allen, 2005 ). The business model, both as a concept and a related construct, has largely referred to the value architecture of a business ( Foss & Saebi, 2018 ;Rappa, 2001; Teece, 2010 ;Timmers, 1998 ;Weill & Vitale, 2013), that is, how the ﬁrm creates value, delivers this value to its customers and entices them to pay, eventually converting these payments to pro ﬁt (Teece, 2010 ). BMI, by contrast, deals with “designed, novel, non-trivial changes to the key elements of a ﬁrm's business model and/or the ar- chitecture linking these elements ”(Foss and Saebi, 2018, p. 201). Notwithstanding the great emphasis that the literature has recently placed on developing an understanding of Business Models and their innovation ( Zott et al., 2011), this research stream and the associated practice both still su ﬀer from a severe lack of homogeneity, clarity and direction ( Ghezzi, 2013 ;Johnson, Christensen, & Kagermann, 2008; Wirtz, Pistoia, Ullrich, & Göttel, 2016 ). Massa, Tucci and Afuah recently tackled this controversial state in the current academic debate (2016), ﬁnding that, beyond the tradi- tional interpretation whereby business models are seen as formal con- ceptual representations of how a business is structured and functions - i.e. aﬁrm's value architecture -, two further perspectives have emerged from the management literature: (i) business --- architecture -, two further perspectives have emerged from the management literature: (i) business models as attributes ofrealﬁrms; and (ii) business models as cognitive/linguistic schemas. This fragmentation has led scholars to debate whether de ﬁning business models and BMI is actually a “wicked ”problem - a problem so poorly deﬁ ned and structured that inquiry appears hopeless ( Buchanan, 1992 ).Foss and Saebi (2018) eventually argued that, instead of being a wicked problem, what burdens business models and BMI research is rather a “paradigmatic ”issue, where a lack of construct clarity, little agreement about deﬁ nitions and the di ﬃculty in ﬁnding the dimensions for assessing core constructs together currently limit cumulative theoryA. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 520 --- from being built and tested. In an attempt to solve this issue, Foss and Saebi (2018) proposed that business models and BMI should be assessed in terms of the architecture of the ﬁrm's value creation, delivery and capture mechanisms - in line with Teece (2010) . The deﬁ nition and assessment of business models and their in- novation process has become a topic of paramount importance in the ﬁelds of strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship, because a growing number of scholars and practitioners agree that well-established com-panies and startups should now look beyond their isolated product, service or process innovation and focus instead on innovating their entire business model, which becomes the new unit of analysis for in- novation e ﬀorts ( Chesbrough, 2007, 2010 ;Lindgardt, Reeves, Stalk, & Deimler, 2009 ). BMI involves innovation to at least one of the foundational elements of value creation, delivery and capture, and thereby gives a ﬁrm the potential to activate overlooked value sources within the company or create news systems that are di ﬃcult to imitate ( Amit & Zott, 2012 ). To date, the literature contains notable contributions and evidence on successful examples of Business Model Innovation processes relating mainly to large organizations ( Amit & Zott, 2012 ;Chesbrough, 2007; Johnson et al., 2008 ;Schaltegger, Lüdeke-Freund, & Hansen, 2012; Sosna, Trevinyo-Rodríguez, & Velamuri, 2010), although BMI also re- fers to smaller organizations and startups ( Klewitz & Hansen, 2014 ). More importantly, scholars and practitioners alike are calling for thedevelopment of practical tools and approaches to support Business Model Innovation (e.g. Foss & Saebi, 2018 ;Trimi & Berbegal-Mirabent, 2012 ). In line with this concluding remark, we will argue that Lean Startup Approaches should be interpreted as a ﬁrst - albeit still mostly unrecognized - attempt to ﬁll this gap. 2.2. Lean Startup Approaches “Lean philosophy ”and its principles originated in the manu- --- this gap. 2.2. Lean Startup Approaches “Lean philosophy ”and its principles originated in the manu- facturing world ( Hines, Holweg, & Rich, 2004 ;Womack & Jones, 1997 ) after the end of the Second World War, as a result of customers' needs evolving towards higher value in combination with companies' in- creasingly diverse o ﬀer. This signi ﬁcant redirection of production sys- tems towards customer value is summarized in the “ﬁve principles of lean ”described below ( Womack & Jones, 1997): 1.Create value for the customer . Value is created when internal waste decreases and so costs are reduced, and is increased by o ﬀering new services and/or functions valued by the customer. 2.Identify the value stream . The concept of value stream must not hide behind a wall of obscurity. The costs of every ﬁrm must be trans- parent to all supply chain partners. 3.Create ﬂow. The principle of creating ﬂow has the aim of avoiding any stoppage in the value stream by preventing the main causes ofsuch stoppages (i.e. changes in production, breakdowns, incorrect batches in terms of quantity or timing, lack of necessary information and re-entrant loops). 4.Produce only what is pulled by the customer . This principle implies high responsiveness while producing the highest quality products in an eﬃcient and valuable way. The production pull is extended up- hill to the suppliers and the whole upstream supply chain. 5.Pursue perfection by continuously identifying and eliminating waste. As emerges from these principles, lean can be de ﬁned as a customer and value-centric approach to creating a ﬂow of activities that con- tinuously generate customer value by eliminating non-value-addingactivities or “waste ”(Feld, 2000; Liker, 1997 ;Womack & Jones, 1997 ). While the lean philosophy arose in the manufacturing ﬁeld, recent attempts were made to extend its application and impact to neigh- bouring areas. For instance, Reinertsen and Shaeﬀ er (2005) showed that, if carefully implemented, this --- areas. For instance, Reinertsen and Shaeﬀ er (2005) showed that, if carefully implemented, this philosophy can enhance R&D resultsand psychological motivation during exploration operations.Similarly, Ries (2011) andBlank (2013) made an attempt to adapt and combine the lean philosophy and its principles to the startups' development area by elaborating “Lean Startup ”and “Customer De- velopment ”methods - which we have grouped under the title of Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs). Borrowing from the overall deﬁ nition of lean, LSAs are deﬁ ned as the startup's attempt to cut its own waste, understood as all the activ- ities and processes which the target customer does not want or does not ask for ( Blank, 2013; Ries, 2011). LSAs consist of a scienti ﬁc, hypothesis-driven approach to en- trepreneurship, where entrepreneurs translate their vision - i.e. business idea - into falsi ﬁable hypotheses which are embedded in a ﬁrst version of a business model. These hypotheses are then tested through a seriesof minimum viable products (MVPs), which are “the smallest set of activities needed to disprove a hypothesis ”(Eisenmann  et al. 2012 - p. 2). In line with the scienti ﬁc method, hypotheses testing is performed through experiments that involve “evangelists ”, that is, expert prospects who can provide informed and useful feedback to the startup. Directly involving evangelists to test ideas and MVPs - rather than basing ones' evaluations merely on secondary data or “desk research” - is a clear illustration of the “get out of the building” approach advocated by Blank (2013) . On the basis of the test outcomes, entrepreneurs are faced with three main options: (i) persevere with their proposed business model - if the hypotheses are proven to be right; (ii) modify or pivot to a revised business model, where the business models parameters con ﬁrmed by the tests are retained and the others are improved on; (iii) or perish,that is, drop the business idea and, in turn, the startup that --- are improved on; (iii) or perish,that is, drop the business idea and, in turn, the startup that was to have been launched around it. The process is iterated until all key hypotheses are con ﬁrmed or validated through MVP tests. When this condition is reached, the startup has achieved its “product-market ﬁt”(Eisenmann et al., 2012), which means that the value proposition designed and iteratively revised by the startup actually satis ﬁes the needs of its target customers. Product-market ﬁt hence represents the successful conclusion of the “build-measure-learn ”loop, where the startup builds an MVP and as- sociated tests, measures the test results and customer feedback andlearns how to change its business idea and business model accordingly. In a similar vein, Blank and Dorf's (2012) andBlank's (2013) Cus- tomer Development holds that entrepreneurs are ﬁrst called to “search ” for a scalable and replicable business model along the stages of cus-tomer discovery - i.e. identi ﬁcation of evangelists - and validation - i.e. experimenting and testing. This search is followed by the executionphase, where the startups consolidates and scales up their business validation model through customer creation - i.e. marketing spending - and company building - i.e. the structuring of organizational teams, functions and units. 2.3. Agile development According to Qumer and Henderson-Sellers (2006) , agility is the ability to accommodate and adapt to changes in a dynamic environ- ment. Being agile means applying previous knowledge while learning from current experience in order to deliver high-quality products, under budget constraints and in short time frames ( Jyothi & Rao, 2012). Agility hence encompasses the features of ﬂexibility, velocity, learning and response to change and leanness ( Campanelli & Parreiras, 2015; Conboy & Fitzgerald, 2004 ). Agile Development refers to a number of agility-enabling practices for software development ( Jalali & Wohlin, 2010 ;Lee & Yong, 2013 ) --- range of application for agile methods. Agile works well when handlingcomplex problems that can be broken down into distinct modules where iterations are feasible and mistakes are a chance to learn - rather than something to be necessarily avoided ( Rigby et al., 2016 ). Complex products with limited modularity may, instead, require a Stage-Gate,plan-based approach or a hybrid agile and Stage-Gate model, as sug- gested by Cooper and Sommer (2016) . This latter remark brings up another question and related gap in literature concerning the suitabilityof agile for validating and innovating a whole business model built around a product, service or value proposition. To date, few studiesfollow this promising research direction: however, since the business model is considered to be a complex and modular system of value (Massa, Tucci, & Afuah, 2016 ), the opportunity of applying forms of agile and AD when innovating a BM - understood as a modular object orsystem - is worth investigating. We will argue that the LSAs are the emerging form of a BMI-supporting AD. 3. Material and methods This research has been designed as an exploratory multiple case study ( Eisenhardt, 1989 ;Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007; Yin, 1984 ). A case study is an “empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context; when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident; and in which multiple sources of evidence are used ”(Yin, 1984 - p. 23 ). Within our multiple case study, we have examined the early stage Business Model Innovation process undertaken by three di ﬀerent digital multisided platform startups in real-life contexts that vary in terms ofenvironmental dynamism - moderate or high - and the relative role played by the startup - which can be subject to or instead determine this dynamism. Following Van Maanen (1979) and Clark, Gioia, Ketchen Jr., and Thomas (2010) , we selected an interpretive research approach, which “gives voice in the --- when innovating our business model was a top priority for us ,and lean and agile tools and methods came in handy ”. This within-case ﬁnding con ﬁrms the fact that LSAs and AD methods are often tightly coupled and used jointly within the same organization. The main barriers to BMI mentioned by the interviewees referred to their tests on pricing and costs, con ﬁrming their marked focus on op- erating well-performing value capture mechanisms. A strong entrepreneurial and innovative organizational culture ran through the entire BMI process - traditionally a given for startups(Gartner, 1985 ) - manifesting itself through opportunity-seeking beha- vior, heavy reliance on the entrepreneurial team's leadership, thecreation of cross-functional teams collaborating with one another and informal ﬂows of communication. This clearly emerges from a story told by the co-founder about their regular “Saturday Future ”meeting: “every Saturday ,my co -founders and I meet for co ﬀee;we each then spend an hour alone thinking about our future as a company ,coming together to share and discuss our ideas about future opportunities and the challenges ahead ,as well as how we should grab these opportunities and tackle the challenges in the upcoming week .The whole thing lasts for a couple of hours. You may think that's too long for a co ﬀee[laughs], but it's how we keep our eyes and minds open to running our startup better ”. The digital startup illustrated in Case B faced a highly dynamic environment battered by technology innovation; the startup needed toadapt to - and possibly leverage on - this environmental turbulence. While all the business model's foundational elements were subject to innovation in the early stages of its development, the startup focused mainly on testing and changing its value delivery mechanisms. This included the actions of developing a user-friendly mobile app interface; carving out a position in the crowded competitive payment services arena by targeting --- emerged during our interviews, with speci ﬁc reference to the question on the metho- dology, model, approach, tool or instrument used to support and enablethe BMI process, as well as that on the primary steps, elements and concepts that best describe BMI (see Appendix A ). BMI, which acts as our driving research question for all our cases, spans across the whole map, although its distinctive features emerge more clearly when the dynamism and the startup's active role both increase (Case C), and we move towards Strategic Agility. Naturally,A. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 529 --- BMI encompasses the dimensions of value creation, delivery and cap- ture - as well as that of testing the business model's constituent ele- ments. Concerning AD, the interviews and the archival data underscore how the digital startups actually leveraged on Agile Development methods for their daily project management operations. Our informants frequently mentioned a number of terms explicitly - and we collected them as both in vivo and constructed codes -, having drawn them from their adoption of agile methods, such as “sprints ”and Scrum ( Schwaber & Sutherland, 2011 ), Feature-Driven Development ( Palmer & Felsing, 2001 ), and Adaptive Software Development ( Highsmith, 2000 ). The adoption of AD is more apparent in Cases A and B, where the startup isonly subject to environmental change; moreover, our ﬁndings indicate that agile methods still act on the business model's dimensions of value,but chie ﬂy in an operational, incremental and tactical way. Agile De- velopment hence largely falls into the area of operational agility. To assess the role and positioning of startups in Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs), we took into account the fact that all informantsexplicitly mentioned that LSAs had been adopted when undertaking BMI proceedings, and that they indicated testing as being an over- arching dimension of the BMI process. Since experimenting on the business model is at the heart of Lean Startup Approaches, LSAs are considered to be a method to support entrepreneurs in their BMI en- deavors. At the same time, when the informants described how they use agile methods to support their operational testing, they also mentioned lean principles. Within our ﬁndings, several touchpoints emerge that connect LSAs and AD: for instance, the concept of MVP (MinimumViable Products) in LSAs is consistent with the agile principle of minimum upfront planning; similarly, AD and LSAs share the iterative “feedback and change ”process, which should involve customers ac- tively in the --- share the iterative “feedback and change ”process, which should involve customers ac- tively in the testing phase. As a result, our exploration allowed us to infer that BMI, LSAs and AD are indeed related, and LSAs belong to both the BMI and AD ﬁelds, thus representing an area where these domains connect and overlap. We then argue that Lean Startup Approaches stand at the crossroads of Business Model Innovation and Agile Development, and are a form ofthe agile methods that can be applied to products, services, value propositions andwhole business models. The tight connection we found between lean and agile was already pointed at by extant literature: for instance, Smits (2007) argued that the future of agile methods lies in its origins, that is, lean principles; andSerignese (2010) wrote that lean is both the precursor and the future of agile. Our study contributes to extending such connections, by focusingon the LSAs-AD relationship and moving it from the domain of opera- tions to that of strategy, using BMI as a leit-motif and common unit of analysis. In the light of the arguments provided, we advance the following propositions: Proposition 5. In the context of early stage digital startups, the concepts and constructs used in Lean Startup Approaches stand at the crossroads of Business Model Innovation and Agile Development. Proposition 5(a). In the context of early stage digital startups, Lean Startup Approaches are a form of Agile Development applied to products, services, value propositions and whole Business Model Innovation. In addition to the above discussion, we suggest that LSAs also cut across operational and Strategic Agility, providing entrepreneurs with aset of concepts and constructs to orchestrate the tensions between using existing scarce resources to the best advantage and constantly renewing and recombining new and existing resources into other, original ones (Teece, 2007 ). This consideration is reformulated in the following propositions: --- original ones (Teece, 2007 ). This consideration is reformulated in the following propositions: Proposition 6. In the context of early stage digital startups, the concepts and constructs used in Lean Startup Approaches cut acrossoperational and Strategic Agility.Proposition 6(a). In the context of early stage digital startups, adopting Lean Startup Approaches helps to orchestrate the tensions arising from concurrently managing the startup's existing endowment of resources and recombining them into new and original resources. To summarize, clarifying the relationship between BMI, LSAs and AD opens up a number of opportunities for cross-fertilization between theseﬁelds and the associated concepts and constructs. While having no ambition to be exhaustive, we point to the four directions mentionedin our introduction ( Section 1) and literature review ( Section 2). First, by linking BMI research to LSAs, this could help to solve the paradig-matic problem that weighs on Business Model Innovation theory ( Foss & Saebi, 2018 ), inviting BMI researchers to accrue cumulative empirics through LSA cases: for instance, the metrics for measuring BMI could mirror the LSA metrics found in the startups' cases. This cross-fertili- zation could be bidirectional, as the LSAs could explicitly include BMI concepts, such as the notion of complementarity between the business models' di ﬀerent constituent elements - thus encouraging the design of MVPs that could be tested for more hypotheses and BM parameters atthe same time. Second, recognizing how BMI and LSAs are related could provide further evidence that the business model concept is shifting to include demand-side value ( Massa et al., 2016). This theory is fully aligned and consistent with LSAs, where a value proposition can bedesigned and innovated on the basis of demand-side elements - e.g. the customer's perception of value. Third, BMI research could look for a strategic application of other agile methods beyond lean, thus ex- --- BMI research could look for a strategic application of other agile methods beyond lean, thus ex- tending the range of applications for AD, a point currently under question ( Cooper & Sommer, 2016 ). Fourth, Agile Development could possibly expand and deepen its theoretical foundations by taking ele-ments from the Business Model Innovation and the Strategic Agility streams. 7. Conclusions This study investigated how digital startups in the early stages of their development engage with Business Model Innovation, in contexts with di ﬀerent levels of environmental dynamism and where the startups take on changing roles, in terms of whether they determinesuch dynamism or not. More speci ﬁcally, we designed a multiple case study to explore whether BMI is related with Lean Startup Approachesand Agile Development, and how environmental dynamism and/or the startup's role therein can in ﬂuence this relationship. Like all research attempting to frame reality in a model, our study is not free from limitations. These for the most part depend on: the pe- culiarity of the context under examination - digital startups in the early stages of their development - as well as the small sample size, which could limit the generalization and relevance of our ﬁndings; and the observer bias typical of qualitative studies, which could lead to the lossof valuable information and insight and is dependent on several factors - e.g. the informants' poor understanding of the researchers' questions and their inaccurate recollection of events -; and the researchers' in- ability to properly grasp, interpret and inductively aggregate the in- formation provided by the informants. Concerning the ﬁrst limitation, we started from the assumption that early digital startups could providea relatively novel case within a fast-growing empirical ﬁeld where we could adventure into BMI, LSAs and AD processes and relations. Havingsaid this, future studies should try to replicate our research in di ﬀerent and --- relations. Havingsaid this, future studies should try to replicate our research in di ﬀerent and possibly more mature contexts, with broader theoretical or evenstatistical samples. With regards to the second limitation, our relianceon a well-established method, which we applied throughout the data collection and analysis steps, has possibly helped to enhance the soundness of our qualitative exploration into how the lean and agile Business Model Innovation unfolds. Despite its limitations, this study contributes to both theory and practice in multiple ways.A. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 530 --- Our work provides value for theory insomuch as it delivers a uni ﬁed framework that connects BMI, LSAs and AD - as well as their main steps and constituent elements - to operational and Strategic Agility ( Doz & Kosonen, 2008, 2010). Adding to the current research stream on how tobuild Strategic Agility from a resources and capabilities perspective (Battistella, De Toni, De Zan, & Pessot, 2017; Johnston, 2009 ;Teece, 2007 ), we argue that the approaches and methods discussed for LSAs and AD may be used to adequately orchestrate and manage the startup's extant resource endowment, or stimulate the creation of new resources by recombining resources di ﬀerently. Hence, BMI in a Strategic Agility framework can fruitfully draw on Agile Development and Lean StartupApproaches to nurture Doz and Kosonen's (2008) meta-capabilities of strategic sensitivity, resource ﬂuidity and leadership unity. Through our framework, we claim that Lean Startup Approaches can be perceived as a form of Agile Development operating at the levelof strategy and business models. In other words, LSAs are agile methods for Business Model Innovation. We hence explicitly embed the roots and antecedents of the practitioner-oriented LSAs in the Business Model Innovation and Agile Development ﬁelds of research. Because theo- rizing on common practices among practitioners - and LSAs are widelydiﬀused within the digital entrepreneur community - is typically a complex process ( Delery & Doty, 1996), discussing the antecedents and identifying the shared themes that connect these practices to other more established research streams - such as BMI, AD and Strategic Agility - is crucial when attempting to construct theoretical foundations (e.g. see Baker, 2007 ;Damanpour & Aravind, 2012; Lukas, Hult, & Ferrell, 1996 ;Agarwal & Malhotra, 2005 ).This study is a ﬁrst step towards building theory on LSAs, and opens up a promising research avenue that will call for further academic contribution. In order to pave the
of agility-enabling practices for software development ( Jalali & Wohlin, 2010 ;Lee & Yong, 2013 ) that value the centrality of individuals and interaction, the incrementaldelivery of working software, collaboration with customers and re- sponse to change (e.g. Beck et al., 2001; Cram & Newell, 2016 ;Paluch et al., 2017 ;Rigby et al., 2016; Senapathi & Srinivasan, 2012). Campanelli and Parreiras (2015) recently carried out a survey on AD methods, ﬁnding that the most widely used methods are ExtremeA. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 521 --- Programming, Scrum, Kanban, Lean, Feature-Driven Development, Dynamic Systems Development Method, Adaptive Software Develop- ment, Crystal and Rational Uni ﬁed Process. These lists indicate that, in the extant literature, it is nothing new or indeed surprising for a leanpractice to be also considered an agile practice. For instance, the Kanban system - a popular lean tool created to manage manufacturing operations ( Ikonen, Kettunen, Oza, & Abrahamsson, 2010 ) - has also been applied to software development, and is therefore included amongthe agile methods ( Campanelli & Parreiras, 2015 ). Similarly, Barton (2009) argues that Scrum uses a lean “pull ”technique to smooth the ﬂow of the system. It follows that, although agile and lean are con- sidered to be distinct concepts (e.g. Hallgren & Olhager, 2009), scholars agree that agility includes “leanness ”as one of its most important at- tributes ( Conboy & Fitzgerald, 2004 ). In the supply chain and in soft- ware development ﬁelds, this recognized integration has led to the proposal of a combined lean and agile practice, called “leagile ”(Mason- Jones et al., 2000 ;Naylor et al., 1999; Wang, Conboy, & Cawley, 2012 ). In a similar vein to lean, agile methods are associated to a common “philosophy ”, where the main values and principles of focus are: (i) individuals and interaction; (ii) working software; (iii) customer col-laboration; and (iv) responding to change ( Campanelli & Parreiras, 2015 ). Although such overarching values and principles typically have a high level of abstraction, they were put forward by experienced prac-titioners ( Beck et al., 2001), who later worked to embed them into the AD methods employed today. The bene ﬁts for practice stemming from the application of AD methods have been widely recognized ( Cram & Newell, 2016 ;De Cesare, Lycett, Macredie, Patel, & Paul, 2010). AD methods are meant to take dynamism and uncertainty into fair account within the product innovation process, by including --- take dynamism and uncertainty into fair account within the product innovation process, by including iterations, feed- back-feedforward cycles and intense testing procedures that depart signiﬁcantly from a well-structured - although often rigid plan-based - Stage-Gate approach ( Cooper, 2008). The Stage-Gate approach em- phasizes the crucial importance of extremely detailed upfront planning,to avoid wasting resources later during the execution and maintenance phases ( Cooper, 1990 ). Change is, therefore, perceived as something to possibly limit, and every step ahead is the result of a top down decision(Sommer, Hedegaard, Dukovska-Popovska, & Steger-Jensen, 2015 ). This point reveals that a pure Stage-Gate approach is most likely un-suitable in dynamic environments where change seems necessary on a regular basis. Conversely, Agile Development practices involve multiple short plan-execution cycles governed by customer feedback and rapid change ( Beck et al., 2001 ;Wang et al., 2012 ). A minimum amount of upfront planning and customer involvement in the development processare key elements in agile practices ( Wang et al., 2012 ). As well as the wide-spread adoption of agile methods and practices, scholars also highlight their possible shortcomings, such as deployment diﬃculties, sometimes ambiguous bene ﬁts and the lack of project ownership and accountability ( Balijepally, Mahapatra, Nerur, & Price, 2009 ;Cram & Newell, 2016 ;Drury, Conboy, & Power, 2012; Janes & Succi, 2012; Laanti, Salo, & Abrahamsson, 2011 ). A recent study by Conboy and Fitzgerald (2010) also sheds light on the need for organi- zations to customize AD methods to ﬁnd their own version, the one that bestﬁts their speci ﬁc challenges and objectives, all of which makes the method application less straightforward than commonly expected. Moreover, a current debate in business research is questioning the range of application for agile methods. Agile works well when handlingcomplex problems that can be --- –6)..

Jr., and Thomas (2010) , we selected an interpretive research approach, which “gives voice in the interpretation of events in a ﬁrst-order ana- lysis to the people actually experiencing those events ”(Clark et al., 2010 - p. 403 ). We then formulated a second order interpretation of the informants' voices which referred to - but was not limited to - BusinessModel Innovation theory, possibly contributing to theory building. Although exploratory theory building research should start with little or no theory under consideration and no hypotheses to test - since“preordained theoretical perspectives or propositions may bias and limit the ﬁndings ”- according to Eisenhardt (1989 - p. 536) , it is vir- tually impossible to start with a “clear theoretical slate ”. Nonetheless, in an attempt to follow an exploratory approach coherently, we strivedto maintain a neutral point of view when asking our informants to re- member the BMI process they went through when their startup was in its early stages. In getting the multiple case study o ﬀthe ground, BMI theory was needed solely to act as a starting point to draw up a su ﬃ- ciently broad research question, and so initiate the data gathering process ( Eisenhardt, 1989; Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007). The in- formants were not exposed to any preordained relationships with othertheories or approaches, such as LSAs and AD, before or during the in- terviews. Case sampling was performed theoretically ( Eisenhardt, 1989; Meredith, 1998 ), and following our interpretive stance, cases were se- lected according to how heterogeneous they were in terms of two re-levant variables that could have had an in ﬂuence over the BMI process: (i) environmental dynamism - moderate or high; and (ii) the startup'srole in terms of being subject to or determining such dynamism. Fol- lowing this choice, we identi ﬁed three relevant cases concerning digital mobile platform startups that either operate in a moderately dynamicenvironment (Case A) or a highly --- platform startups that either operate in a moderately dynamicenvironment (Case A) or a highly dynamic environment (Case B) to which they are subject, or in a highly dynamic environment determined by the digital startup itself (Case C). The level of environmental dy- namism and the digital startups' role within their environment were informed by the analysis of secondary sources, as suggested in Meredith (1998) . Despite competing in di ﬀerent industries - namely, home maintenance and repair services for Case A, cashless payments for Case B and accommodation services for Case C - a common factor for all three digital startups was that they operated a multisided platform business connecting di ﬀerent pools of customers ( Evans & Schmalensee, 2016 ;Gawer, 2014 ) and, having selected similar business approaches, it was easier to carry our comparisons and cross-case analysis. We opted for a multiple case study since this approach potentially reinforces the process of generalizing results ( McGrath, 2010 ;Meredith, 1998 ), while enabling a comparative analysis of the ﬁndings, because the theoretical sample can possibly include extreme cases, polar typesA. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 522 --- or niche situations ( Meredith, 1998 ). Despite this, the limited number of digital startups included in the sample allowed us to retain the po- sitive properties of a single case study methodology in terms of ac- quiring an extensive qualitative description and analysis of BMI in the early stages of the startups' development, together with the needed depth and insight, which is di ﬃcult to replicate on a wider sample (Handﬁeld & Melnyk, 1998). For all three cases, our unit of analysis was the early stage BMI process undertaken by each digital startup, with its steps and constituent elements as possible sub-units of analysis. 3.1. Data gathering In our multiple case study, data were collected through multiple sources of information ( Yin, 1984). Face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were the primary source of information. Because the interviews used in the data collection process were semi-structured, this meant that the interviewers could start from several key issues identi ﬁed from the research question - and so not risk leaving the interviewer at the interviewee's mercy - while allowing anyinnovative matter to emerge from the ensuing open discussion (Walsham, 1995 ;Yin, 1984). The researchers ﬁrst crafted and carried out two pilot interviews with two founders of a digital startup not included in the theoretical sample, known to the researchers from being involved in previous studies. The pilot interviews allowed us to con ﬁrm that the research questions and related sub-questions were clear to the informants andcould lead to insightful discussions - although the pilot informants'feedback did lead to minor changes in the wording of the questions to improve clarity. Following the pilot interviews, the researchers carried out thirteen semi-structured interviews over three distinct waves with the three digital startups in the theoretical sample. The six interviews in Case A took place between February and July 2015 with the four founders of the digital startup - --- ’”(p. 324), we followed an iterative process, gathering and considering a ﬁrst set of secondary sources before conducting the interviews, as well as assembling a second set of secondary sources that were cited or delivered by the informants during or right after the interviews. The data triangulation process considered all the secondary sources (i.e. data from interviews, participants' observations, archival data and external documents) ob- tained at di ﬀerent steps of the process - see Appendix B . 3.2. Data analysis The responses from the interviewees were recorded and fully tran- scribed. If any information was still unclear and/or more data was needed, the informants were later contacted by telephone to ask for clariﬁ cation.A. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 523 --- Then, following the recommendations of Eisenhardt (1989) ,a within-case data analysis was carried out to generate the necessary insight into the issues under scrutiny; a subsequent cross-case analysis allowed us to make a comparison between the di ﬀerent responses given by the informants from the three di ﬀerent startups. Concerning the within-case analysis, interview content analysis was performed by borrowing the open coding practice from GroundedTheory methodology ( Glaser & Strauss, 1967 ;Strauss & Corbin, 1998 ), a method suitable to study complex phenomena through a clearly de-ﬁned procedure based on coding - i.e. labels, concepts and words used to produce theory from interviews, rather than the mere ﬁnding of facts (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The empirical material was codi ﬁed through textual analysis, and archived using a software package. For each of the three cases, we built an inductive coding tree based on both “in vivo ”and constructed codes ( Glaser & Strauss, 1967), re- cording the exact wording used by the informants to describe the pro- cess being investigated, as well as the constructed wording induced by the researchers. The codes relating to the interviews for each startup were iteratively contrasted and compared in order to group them into sets of ﬁrst order concepts. These ﬁrst order concepts were then further grouped around a set of second order themes or categories, allowing usto view the data at a higher level of abstraction ( Clark et al., 2010 ). Eventually, as a third and concluding step, the second order themeswere grouped into overarching dimensions that captured the most im- portant steps and constituent elements in a BMI process. Through the inductive coding tree, ﬁne-grained in vivo codes were transformed into aggregated concepts, and the real-world content obtained from thequalitative interviews enabled us to proceed with the abstraction and theory building ( Saldaña, 2009). With reference to cross-case analysis, we looked for --- and theory building ( Saldaña, 2009). With reference to cross-case analysis, we looked for similarities and diﬀerences between Cases A, B and C with reference to the ﬁrst order concepts, second order themes and, above all, the overarching dimen-sions ( Yin, 1984). This concluding procedure allowed us to contrast and compare the BMI process steps and constituent elements within the three very di ﬀerent digital startups under investigation, allowing us to make the best use of our multiple case study on Digital Entrepreneur-ship to “capture the novel ﬁndings that may appear in the data ” (Eisenhardt, 1989 - p. 541). To conclude, the case results were reviewed and con ﬁrmed by the interviewees, to potentially amend any error or bias and ultimatelyenhance the correctness of our interpretations. 4. Cases The multiple case studies relate to three digital startups undergoing early stage Business Model Innovation, heterogeneously positioned in terms of their environmental dynamism - moderate or high - and role in determining such dynamism. 4.1. Case A - moderate environmental dynamism imposed upon the digital startup Case A refers to a digital startup founded in 2011. The founders recognized the need for a two-sided platform capable of matching theoﬀer (i.e. from SMEs and individual providers) and demand (from private customers) for services and errands such as cleaning, housemaintenance and repairs. When private users post a request for a ser- vice or errand on Case A's platform, SMEs and individual providers viewing it can send a description of their services and relative quota- tions to their potential customers, who will then select the serviceprovider who o ﬀers the best service description-quotation trade-o ﬀ, activate the transaction and execute a payment; the startup receives aservice fee of between 5% and 7% for each transaction - this is the pay per transaction model. The digital startup operates in a moderately dynamic environment - that of traditional house --- model. The digital startup operates in a moderately dynamic environment - that of traditional house maintenance and repairs services and errands -and, although it innovated its model, it did not dramatically reshape itsindustry or intensify the industry volatility and turbulence. In the early stages of its development, the digital startup went through several BMI cycles, which tackled di ﬀerent sides of its business model, with a focus on the mechanisms for capturing value. 4.2. Case B - high environmental dynamism imposed upon the digital startup Case B refers to a digital startup founded in 2013 that handles electronic payments between individuals and merchants. The platform allows end-users (buyers) to make feeless cashless micropayments, while it charges merchants (sellers) a ﬁxed fee for transactions of more than 10€. When users register on the platform, they are automaticallyassigned a virtual wallet; users can designate a weekly budget to be paid to the platform, and an algorithm automatically uses SSD (Single Europe Payment Area - SEPA - Direct Debit) to collect this sum from the user's bank account and place it in their virtual wallet. This weekly budget is capped at 200€. At the end of every week, the users' budget is automatically reset by collecting the amount spent or depositing the excess - built up whenever the user receives a peer-to-peer payment from other users. Considering the merchants' side, every night the platform makes an SCT (SEPA Credit Transfer) transaction to move the sums collected during the day directly into the merchants' bank ac- count. The startup's main strategic goal was to pursue fast growth, enabled by integrating the platform into di ﬀerent channels, thus allowing in- creased market coverage while facilitating its adoption by both usersand merchant - in line with its positioning as a two-sided platform. The startup illustrated in Case B operates in the “ﬁnancial tech- nology ”(or FinTech) industry, where digital technologies --- in Case B operates in the “ﬁnancial tech- nology ”(or FinTech) industry, where digital technologies can enable innovation in the standard ﬁnancial services typically provided by banks and insurance companies. As a result, the ﬁnancial services in- dustry - with speci ﬁc reference to e-payments - has been the “land of conquest ”for many newcomers having to compete against each other as well as against the incumbent ﬁnancial services companies ( Mills & McCarthy, 2017), thereby increasing market turbulence. The digitalstartup investigated in Case B operates in a highly dynamic environ- ment (i.e. the e-payments sector), although this dynamism was the outcome of various macro-trends rather than the startup's own strategy and innovation; nevertheless, the startup was interested in innovating its BM with a focus on value delivery mechanisms, in order to adapt to and align itself with this highly dynamic environment. 4.3. Case C - high environmental dynamism determined by the digital startup Case C relates to a digital startup founded in 2007 that o ﬀers an accommodation booking service, whereby people can list, ﬁnd and book various types of accommodation - e.g. apartments, rooms, villas - around the world through their mobile phones or over the internet. The startup's original aim was to target and enter a niche market by re- designing the whole customer experience, allowing users to reserve accommodation in a few clicks using digital technologies. As a result, the founders created a two-sided platform capable of matching the o ﬀer (i.e. house-owners or hosts) and demand (i.e. private individuals orguests) for overnight stays in periods when hotels are potentially ex- pensive or hard to come by because of popular or busy events held inthe surrounding areas. Once private individuals have registered on the platform, they can easily ﬁnd and contact the best house-owners or hosts for their desired overnight stay. Considering the hosts' side, upon registration, house-owners --- for their desired overnight stay. Considering the hosts' side, upon registration, house-owners can post a description of their o ﬀer and chat with potential guests, giving them more information about their ac-commodation. When the expectations of both sides of the platform - guest and host - are matched, the payment can be transferred through the platform, with the digital startup in Case C retaining a booking fee - a small percentage from the host and a bigger one from the guest.A. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 524 --- While the digital startup initially targeted a speci ﬁc niche, its in- novation proceedings eventually introduced a disruption to the entire accommodation industry. The startup's matching platform largely contributed to the uprise of the informal tourism accommodation market, directly in ﬂuencing other traditional competing o ﬀers from hotels and resorts. By redesigning the entire customer experience, thedigital startup helped to create a new standard for customer expecta- tions and satisfaction, a ﬀecting other traditional companies operating in the tourism market - e.g. traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies- which, in turn, found it di ﬃcult to adapt and exploit the opportunities deriving from digital technologies ( Candela & Figini, 2012; Kracht & Wang, 2010). As a result of the shakeout in the tourism sector induced by this digital startup, several incumbent businesses went bankrupt relatively abruptly, in line with the expected implications of the what is known as “big-bang disruption ”(Downes & Nunes, 2013). This dis- ruption came about through the digital startup's BMI, which largelyfocuses on radically new value creation mechanisms that triggered high environmental dynamism within the whole tourism industry. 5. Results In line with the methods presented in Section 3 , we have described the three inductive coding trees for the digital startups involved in our multiple case study. These representations allowed us to structure within-case results that converge towards the more theoretical over- arching dimensions or concepts. Table 1 shows the inductive coding tree for Case A, while the coding trees for Cases B and C are given in Appendix C . It is worth noting that Table 1 is not meant to be either a causal or a dynamic model in itself, but rather a representation of the core concepts and their relationships. These inductive coding trees were derived from the interviews' protocol discussed in Section 3.1 . More speci ﬁcally, for Case A, the ﬁrst order --- the interviews' protocol discussed in Section 3.1 . More speci ﬁcally, for Case A, the ﬁrst order concepts and second order themes that determined the over-arching dimensions of value delivery and value capture largely derive from the semi-structured questions belonging to the ﬁrst three sets of questions - as reported in the Annex, while the content that had beenstructured during the overarching dimensions of experimenting and testing, operational agility and entrepreneurial and innovative organi- zational culture mostly come from the fourth set of questions. With reference to Case B and Case C, the content and overarching dimensions relating to value creation, value delivery and value capture came mainly from the ﬁrst three sets of questions, while most of the content relating to experimenting and testing, operational agility, strategicagility and entrepreneurial and innovative organizational culture was derived from the fourth set of questions on the BMI steps and its con- stituent elements. While the interviews' protocol and sequence of questions helped in crafting the study's results and the ensuing discussion, because the in- terviews were conducted in an open and semi-structured manner, it is not possible make a straightforward connection between every question and each coded concept, theme or dimension, as these results often originated in the combination of multiple answers to di ﬀerent ques- tions. A cross-case comparison was also performed to complement the within-case analysis and underscore the main similarities and di ﬀer- ences between the three cases and search for any patterns followed by the digital startups during their early stage Business Model Innovation process. In line with Eisenhardt (1989) , a cross-case analysis was conducted along two di ﬀerent strategies. First, the digital startups A, B and C were compared to examine the divergence between the two variables used in the theoretical sampling: (i) level of environmental dynamism - mod- --- the two variables used in the theoretical sampling: (i) level of environmental dynamism - mod- erate to high - and (ii) role of the startup with reference to this dyna- mism - whether it had been imposed on or determined by the startup. Second, the cases were compared with reference to the ﬁrst orderconcepts, second order themes and, most importantly, overarching di-mensions, to identify any possible pattern match or mismatch: this was operationally achieved by merging the coding trees of the three cases. The cross-case analysis ultimately fed into a uni ﬁed framework to generate our propositions, and these could be used as a research agenda to investigate the relationships between Business Model Innovation, Lean Startup Approaches and Agile Development in varying combina- tions of environmental dynamism and the startup's relative role therein. 6. Discussion The exploratory multiple case study revealed several ﬁndings about how digital startups carry out Business Model Innovation in contexts where the levels of environmental dynamism vary as does the role played by the startup in determining this dynamism - or not. In an attempt to extract a contribution from our exploratory re- search for both theory and practice, our discussion will ﬁrst treat each case in isolation, elaborating on each coding tree and the relativewithin-case ﬁndings. Subsequently, the cross-case analysis will provide the basis for a reference framework and set forth a set of propositionsand resulting research agenda. 6.1. Discussion of within-case ﬁndings In Case A, the digital startup operates in an industry of moderate dynamism which the startup had no direct part in generating. During the early stages of its development, the startup touched upon allfoundational elements of a business model - as revealed by the over- arching dimensions of value creation, value delivery and value capture. Value creation consisted mostly of crafting a di ﬀerentiated o ﬀer that satisﬁed both sides of the platform --- discontinuous innovation. Again, quoting one of the founders: “If you plan to radically change a whole market, and you don't really know how ,the only things you should do are to keep looking ,keep listening ,keep learning and be able to disrupt yourself any time you have the chance ”. This ap- proach is quite an accurate representation of what Doz and Kosonen (2008, 2010) described as strategic sensitivity, which they deﬁ ned as the sharpness of perception of, and the intensity of awareness and at- tention to, strategic developments, which lead to experimenting, dis- tancing an organization from its original business model and reframing it in the light of what is learned through experiments. This case shares a similar organizational structure and culture fa- voring entrepreneurial and innovative behavior with the two previous cases and, in addition, it places signi ﬁcant emphasis on the founding members' leadership, foresight and enlightenment, on introducing in-centives for risk-taking and assigning a primary role to knowledge generated through customer feedback. 6.2. Discussion of cross-case ﬁndings: uni ﬁed framework and developing a research agenda Through the cross-case analysis, we were able to obtain an overall view of the ﬁndings that had emerged from the exploratory multiple case study. In the attempt to o ﬀer a vivid picture of these multidimensional ﬁndings, and so develop both our propositions and research agenda, we built a uni ﬁed framework to organize the results into the sets of vari- ables, dimensions and domains discussed in this study. First, we con- sidered the two elements used to theoretically sample early stage digital startups and increase the heterogeneity of the cases: (i) moderate or low level of environmental dynamism; and (ii) the startup's role in terms ofwhether it was subject to or had determined this dynamism. Second, we included the seven overarching dimensions that emerged from the in- ductive coding trees of the three cases: (1) --- seven overarching dimensions that emerged from the in- ductive coding trees of the three cases: (1) Value Capture; (2) Value Delivery; (3) Value Creation; (4) Testing; (5) Operational Agility; (6) Strategic Agility; and (7) Entrepreneurial and Innovative Organizational Culture. Third, we introduced three domains involvingconcepts, constructs and approaches, linked by the relationship that we wished to explore inductively in this study, namely: (A) Business Model Innovation; (B) Lean Startup Approaches; and (C) Agile Development. The resulting uniﬁ ed framework is shown in Fig. 1, where all ele- ments listed above are identi ﬁed by their name and label in brackets. With regards to the sampling variables in the cases, as suggested by Eisenhardt (1989) , we intersected them to design a map where the axes indicate the level of dynamism and digital startup's role; each variableor axis can take two levels - moderate or high, and indicate for each whether the startup is subject to dynamism or determines such dyna- mism. The resulting space shows where our Cases A, B and C were positioned, allowing for cross-case comparisons. It is useful to note that the intersection of these two variables and their associated levels does not immediately lead to a 2 × 2 matrix, since the thresholds separating the diﬀerent levels are blurred and, in the real-world, positioning can be to some extent fuzzy - and deﬁ ning such thresholds lies outside the objectives of this study. As a second step in building the framework, we charted the seven overarching dimensions which had emerged from the exploratory re- search on the three cases. All the constituent elements of a business model, i.e. value creation, delivery and capture, were at the core of the early stage BMI process carried out by the startups, as has clearly emerged from our interviews - with speci ﬁc reference to the ﬁrst, second and third sets of questions set out in Appendix A .  This con ﬁrms that, even in the ﬁeld of digital
in Case A took place between February and July 2015 with the four founders of the digital startup - the current Chief Executive O ﬃcer (CEO), Chief Operations O ﬃcer (COO), Chief Digital Oﬃcer (CDO) and Chief Financial O ﬃcer (CFO) (one interview each) - and its Marketing Vice President (two interviews). The four interviews in Case B took place between April and October 2017 with the three founders - the startup's CEO (two interviews), COO and CFO (one in- terview each). The three interviews in Case C took place between September and October 2017 with one of the startup's founders - its Chief Marketing O ﬃcer (CMO) - one Project Manager and one Product Specialist (one interview each). In Case C, one researcher was a parti-cipant observer at two strategic meetings between the CMO and his team, where they spent a total of 130 min covering the BMI process, allowing us to gain further understanding of the process under scrutiny. The interviews lasted between 70 and 90 min each, with an average of 84 min. The protocol of the interviews was consistent with the study's re- search question: the informants were asked to describe and comment on the Business Model Innovation process undertaken in their digital startup during the early stages of its development - where by early stage we mean the period when the startup's business model was undergoing its most signi ﬁcant innovations leading to its ﬁrst consolidation. In addition, the informants were invited to discuss the key steps in thisBMI process, as well as the constituent elements they dealt with and focused on. As a result, the interviews included a ﬁrst set of questions on the initial working version of their business model in the early stagesof its development (with questions like: “What was your value propo- sition? Who were your initial target customers? How did you organize your digital startup to create and deliver your value proposition to customers? Were you already making a pro ﬁt (i.e. capturing value)? If --- your value proposition to customers? Were you already making a pro ﬁt (i.e. capturing value)? If yes, how? If not, why not? ”). These questions were based on the widely accepted conceptualization of a business model as the process whereby an organization creates, delivers and captures value ( Kulins, Leonardy, & Weber, 2016 ;Saebi, Lien, & Foss, 2017 ;Teece, 2010; Zott et al.,2011 ). Similarly, a second set of questions centred on the startup's current version of their business model, the one that emerged from theinnovation process. Then, based on Foss and Saebi's (2018) concepts on BMI, we devised a third set of questions to investigate the businessmodel's innovation steps and its process (including questions such as: “What are the main changes to your digital startup concerning the way you create, deliver and capture value? Why did you make thesechanges? ”). It is worth mentioning that, when tackling complex phenomena in their real-world context, it is very common for both the interviewers and the interviewees to unconsciously miss or neglect some points. To handle these observer biases ( Yin, 1984 ), we included the ﬁrst and second sets of questions, to obtain a clear picture of the business modelbefore and after the BMI process; these distinct and comparable sets of data on ex ante and ex post business models helped us to interact with the interviewees further, repeating the questions relating to evidentchanges in the BM that the interviewee had yet to mention. This combination of the ﬁrst, second and third sets of questions helped us to avoid missing any information on key BM changes. We concluded witha fourth and ﬁnal set of questions to ask about the approach that had guided the BMI process in terms of its steps and constituent elements(with questions like: “How did you identify the problem and the need for making changes to your previous BM con ﬁguration? How did you reach a solution? How did you know it was the right solution? Did you employ any --- How did you reach a solution? How did you know it was the right solution? Did you employ any methodology, model, approach, tool or instrument to support and enable this process? Can you describe the di ﬃculties you had to manage during the process of identifying the problems andﬁnding a solution? How would you deﬁ ne the changes introduced to your innovated business model? Radical or incremental? What wouldyou say were the most critical steps, elements and concepts that best describe this process of Business Model Innovation within your early stage digital startup? ”). A detailed list of questions driving the semi- structured interviews is given in Appendix A . As case studies rely heavily on the correctness of the information provided by the interviewees for their validity and reliability, and these can be enhanced by using multiple sources or “looking at data in multiple ways ”(Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 2003 ), several secondary sources of evidence and archival data were also added to supplement the interview data, including business plans (one for each case); stra- tegic reports (one for Case A; two each for Cases B and C); informal e- mails (thirty-four for Case A; twenty- ﬁve for Case B; ﬁve for Case C); meeting minutes (six pages for Case A; twenty pages for Case B); in-ternet pages (sixteen for Case A; ﬁfteen for Case B; forty-two for Case C); newspaper articles (three for Case A; seven for Case B; twelve forCase C); and whitepapers (two for Case A; one for Case B; three for Case C). This array of sources led to “data  triangulation ”essential for qua- litative research to be trustworthy and persuasive ( Bonoma, 1985; Siggelkow, 2007 ). In view of the fact that, according to Yin (2013) , with respect to “operational procedures for carrying out triangulations [ …] no benchmarks exist to deﬁ ne when triangulation might be considered ‘strong’ or‘weak ’or‘complete ’or‘incomplete ’”(p. 324), we followed an iterative process, gathering and considering a ﬁrst set of --- consisted mostly of crafting a di ﬀerentiated o ﬀer that satisﬁed both sides of the platform set up by the startup - a critical task for any multisided platform business ( Gawer, 2014 ) - and value delivery focused on managing multiple delivery channels, with the startupplaying an intermediary role between demand and o ﬀer, together with setting up the right strategic partnerships. The startup's focal innova-tion activity concerned its value capture proceedings. Informants fre- quently redirected the conversation towards their e ﬀorts to ﬁnd the right pricing strategy - e.g. fees for users and merchants, with the optionof both sides of the platform paying for the service -, introducing new revenue streams into their revenue models and properly balancing revenue with their cost structure. Not being forced to compete in a highly volatile environment, the digital startup concentrated its BMI on discovering the most pro ﬁtable mechanism to capture value. This was con ﬁrmed by the CEO: “Our business idea was clear to us ,as was how we were to deliver it .The real questions puzzling us in those ﬁrst months were :are users or merchants ,or users and merchants ,willing to pay for it? And how much? On top of that , we were trying to ﬁgure out the actual costs to build and maintain our platform ”. This close attention to the operation's economic and ﬁnancial via- bility was re ﬂected in the testing dimension: most testing - in terms of hypotheses, minimum viable product and metrics - were meant to va-lidate their assumptions on pricing, fee balancing and customer ac- quisition costs. All such assumptions were proved or disproved by carefully assessing customer feedback. The startup's positioning in a moderately dynamic industry, with little ambition to trigger dramatic changes, led to its strong commit- ment to operational agility, where Business Model Innovation had the function of ensuring constant operational alignment - with the COO having a key role in leading BMI - and --- of ensuring constant operational alignment - with the COO having a key role in leading BMI - and managing its existing endow-ment of resources to meet the challenges and complexity of its internal and external environment. When managing projects, the startup also achieved agility in its operations and tactics by systematically in- troducing a number of agile and lean methods, like Scrum Sprints, use cases from the Rational Uni ﬁed Process (RUP) and Feature-Driven Development. As the COO stated, “being constantly ﬂexible, agile and leanA. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 525 --- interface; carving out a position in the crowded competitive payment services arena by targeting micro-payments and transactions; ﬁlling a structural hole in the cashless payment value network ( Gulati, Nohria, & Zaheer, 2000 ) by connecting users and merchants directly; and obtaining all the necessary accreditations and o ﬃcial partnerships with formal institu- tions. Due to the dynamism of the environment in which the startup op- erates, it clearly intended to place itself within a network or ecosystemthat could enhance its position and advantage, while ensuring its ca- pacity to transfer value to customers, although the industry's “[…] winds of change blew in our faces all day and all night long ,and we had to ﬁnd some kind of ‘safe house ’to sit tight in :inﬁnancial services ,that meant getting as many accreditations as possible and building up strong partner-ships ”, as the CFO put it. Consistently with the goal of innovating its value delivery me- chanisms, the startup's testing was based on hypothesizing about the industry's future value network structure; evaluating the performance of the di ﬀerent channels; assessing customer feedback relating to the channels' conversion rates; and focusing on local areas to increasedensity, penetration and network e ﬀects. Although the digital startup did not trigger the market dynamism, this situation called for agility at both operational and strategic levels when proceeding with BMI. The startup's operational agility relied on several factors. These included exploiting the synergies both within the technology infra- structure and among the salesforce involved in propelling the mer- chants' adoption of the service; properly orchestrating their existing resources derived from ﬁnancial technologies; quickly adapting to FinTech trends; and leveraging on a combination of agile and leanapproaches. The highest operational barriers to BMI encountered by the startup referred to organizational and compliance issues, in line with --- to BMI encountered by the startup referred to organizational and compliance issues, in line with its strategic objective to ﬁnd its place in the marketspace. In parallel, a certain level of strategic agility was needed to deal with this dynamicenvironment, in terms of reinventing traditional ways of doing things by exploiting digital technologies in an original manner; and setting up an alternative to the traditional banking and payment system, one diﬃcult for competitors to replicate. When it came to strategic agility, the startup worked hard to adjust to emerging trends and evolvingcustomer needs, consistently with how companies immersed in chaoticenvironments should act, according to Fartash, Davoudi, and Semnan (2012) and Weber and Tarba (2014) . Interestingly, when discussing BMI and the need to be strategically agile, our informants often referred to Lean Startup and Customer Development approaches. As the CEO put it,“when dealing with changing trends and customer expectations ,Lean Startup and Customer Development (we actually see them as pretty much overlapping in some of their phases )helped us to learn and pivot fast ;scale fast if the innovation we wanted to implement was ok ;or fail fast if it was a mistake nobody liked or cared for ”. All of these actions were enabled by an organization sporting a clear vision, where the founders had strong control over their strategies and operations, with highly skilled cross-functional teams and a preference for informal communication ﬂowing both top-down and bottom-up. As the COO said, “it is still relatively easy for me and my co -founders to meet our employees every day ,and is a no -brainer if you want to understand what's going on in your organization and want to move forward consistently , despite all the mess we are regularly coming up against ”. In Case C, the digital startup's BMI determined the high dynamism of its environment. In the early stages of its development, the startup's value delivery and --- of its environment. In the early stages of its development, the startup's value delivery and capture mechanisms were both subject to innova- tion. Rather than focusing on a well-performing pro ﬁt formula or de- signing suitable ways to transfer value for its matchmaking platform-based services value, the innovation e ﬀort targeted value creation. During his interview, the founder reinforced this idea many times: “At that time,the other members of the team and I knew that there was some- thing wrong with the [accommodation ]industry ,but we had little idea of what to do to make things better for both guests and hosts .[…]We kept on wondering how to create a di ﬀerent experience .[…]Our problem was that the hotel market was there :but it was not the market we had in mind …we had to make things di ﬀerent, way di ﬀerent, and we needed to ﬁgure out how ”. Introducing actual disruption through BMI requires a great e ﬀort to converge on value proposition innovation, and so come up withsomething both e ﬃcient and e ﬀective - in line with the big-bang dis- ruption tenets that claim to break the cost-value trade o ﬀ, by leveraging on inexpensive technologies to drop costs, while recombining them in an original way to increase value ( Downes & Nunes, 2013 ). Therefore, tests were run based on di ﬀerent assumptions about how to generate alternative sources of value for property owners and renters, which departed radically from the current accommodation business status quo. Operational agility was a constituent element of the startup's BMI process - in the form of e ﬃciently managing the existing pool of re- sources and a combination of agile and lean methods to run projects inshort iterations. This was reinforced by the Product Specialist: “we used Lean Startup extensively together with several agile methods like Scrum andFDD,because they tell you how not to waste resources ;considering that we had so few resources at that time ,it made total sense not to waste them …”. The --- that we had so few resources at that time ,it made total sense not to waste them …”. The main operational BMI barrier was related to engaging new custo- mers and onboarding them so that they could start their customer journey with a radically new value proposition and experience. However, the core part of the startup's BMI referred to strategic agility, where the startup was concerned with ﬁghting with well-entrenched incumbents in possession of strong resources - e.g. brand, customerbase, marketing budget, ﬁnancial resources, track record. To achieve this, it created an innovative value system based on complex inter-connections of assets, know-how and relationships that, in turn, could generate a defensible competitive advantage. Rather than striving to maintain internal consistency, within its BMI process, the startup created tensions that tended to break the con- sistency of its business model elements, with its ultimate objective being to trigger industry-wide disruption. The resulting business model was constantly under pressure, “stressed  and stretched ”in the words of the Product Specialist. This was the toll the startup had to pay for its attempt to induceA. Ghezzi, A. Cavallo Journal of Business Research 110 (2020) 519–537 527 --- third sets of questions set out in Appendix A .  This con ﬁrms that, even in the ﬁeld of digital startups and with reference to the early stages of their development, the business model is ultimately intendedto be a value architecture ( Foss & Saebi, 2018 ;Ghezzi et al., 2015; Teece, 2010 ). Building on this ﬁnding, we set forth the following pro- position: Proposition 1. Early stage Business Model Innovation for digital startups revolves around the value architecture elements of value creation, value delivery and value capture. Although all startups strived to innovate all of their business models' fundamental elements, the relevant insight comes from the di ﬀerent emphases put on the process: Case A - where the startup was subject toDIGITAL  STARTUP’S  ROLE (ii) L Y T I C I M A N Y D G N I N I M R E T E D Y T I C I M A N Y D O T T C E J B U S ENVIRONMENTAL  DYNAMICITY LEVEL (i)MODERATE DYNAMICITY HIGH DYNAMICITYOPERATIONAL AGILITY (5)STRATEGIC AGILITY (6) BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION (A)ENTREPRENEURIAL AND INNOVATIVE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE (7) AGILE DEVELOPMENT (C)VALUE  CAPTURE  (1)LEAN STARTUP  APPROACHES (B) VALUE  DELIVERY (2)VALUE  CREATION (3) EXPERIMENTING &  TESTING (4) Fig. 1.

Based on these aspects, we specifyProposition 1 as follows: Proposition 1(a). The emphasis of the Business Model Innovation process for early stage digital startups varies according to the level of environmental dynamism and the startup's role in being subject to or determining this dynamism. When the degree of dynamism is moderateand imposes itself on the startup, the startup's focus is on value capture; when the degree of dynamism is high and imposes itself on the startup, the focus is on value delivery; when the degree of dynamism is high and the startup has itself determined this condition, the focus is on value creation. The study also revealed how the BMI of early stage digital startups revolves around the dimension of experimenting and testing - mostly relating to the fourth set of questions listed in Appendix A . All startups relied heavily on formulating hypotheses, setting metrics, iteration andpivoting, involving the overall business model - rather than products and services. This leads to an additional proposition: Proposition 2. Experimenting and testing the overall business model, rather than products and services, is a core step of Business Model Innovation in early stage digital startups. Another insightful ﬁnding derived from the multiple case study, and one that makes it stand out for its implicit --- ﬁnding derived from the multiple case study, and one that makes it stand out for its implicit theoretical contribution, islinked to the ensuing emergence of the operational and Strategic Agility dimensions. These dimensions concern the di ﬀerent focus and tensions that digital startups need to orchestrate when the external and internalconditions - i.e. dynamism and the startup's role - changed. Operational agility mostly referred to implementing agile and lean methods and practices that allow the startups to properly orchestrate their existing pool of resources, adapting them to external complexities; the ultimate goal being to maintain internal consistency. This is aligned with Foss and Saebi's (2018) assertion that BMI should deal with co- ordinating an intricate set of complementarities and synergies betweenthe various resources and activities. The need for operational agility is more evident in Cases A and B, where the startups took a more passive role concerning environmental change, thus showing a rather inward- facing focus. Strategic Agility is deﬁ ned as “the ability to continuously adjust and adapt strategic direction in core business, as a function of strategic ambitions and changing circumstances, and create not just new product and services, but also new business models and innovative ways to create value for a company ”(Doz & Kosonen, 2008 ). This notion was set out as being the thoughtful and purposive interplay between threemeta-capabilities carried out by top management: (i) strategic sensi- tivity, that is, the sharpness of perception of, and the intensity of awareness and attention to, strategic developments; (ii) resource ﬂuidity, that is, the internal capability to recon ﬁgure capabilities and redeploy resources rapidly; and (iii) leadership unity, that is, the abilityof the top management team to make bold, quick decisions ( Doz & Kosonen, 2008, 2010 ;Vecchiato, 2015 ;Weber & Tarba, 2014 ). Startup B and Startup C in particular show signi --- 2010 ;Vecchiato, 2015 ;Weber & Tarba, 2014 ). Startup B and Startup C in particular show signi ﬁcant alignment between the constituent elements of their BMI processes and the way they conceiveStrategic Agility: both startups operated in a highly dynamic environ- ment, and used strategic sensitivity, resource ﬂuidity and leadership unity to set up new value systems and business models to navigatethrough the market.Case C proved that strategically agile behavior is key to playing an active role in a disruption: the informants underscored how sensingnew strategic opportunities, creating new resources and ultimately triggering complexity - rather than simply managing it - were essentialin their early stage BMI. Intriguingly, in Case C, BMI largely consisted of constantly creating internal tensions that could break resource stabilityand business model complementarities, enabling the recombination and renewal of resources; these tensions could then propagate to the ex- ternal environment and determine the big-bang disruption's singularity (Downes & Nunes, 2013 ). Certainly, our research found that operational and Strategic Agility may coexist - as shown in Fig. 1, where the dotted boxes representing these two overarching dimensions overlap to a large extent; however, inthe agility continuum, we experience a gradual shift from operational to Strategic Agility as we move towards the top-right corner of our fra- mework, that is, where dynamism and the startup's active role in its determination both increase. The inclusion of operational and Strategic Agility in our framework allows us to produce the following propositions: Proposition 3. Business Model Innovation for early stage digital startups entails a combination of operational and Strategic Agility.Proposition 3(a). The lower the environmental dynamism and the more passive the role of the early stage digital startup having to cope with this dynamism, the greater the emphasis, within the BMI process, on operational --- having to cope with this dynamism, the greater the emphasis, within the BMI process, on operational agility. Proposition 3(b). The higher the environmental dynamism and the more active the role of the early stage digital startup having to cope with this dynamism, the greater the emphasis, within the BMI process, on Strategic Agility. Proposition 3(c). The greater the emphasis placed on operational agility, the more BMI processes in early stage digital startups will focus on managing their existing resource endowment; maintaining their business model's internal consistency and complementarities; and managing complexity. Proposition 3(d). The greater the emphasis placed on Strategic Agility, the more BMI processes in early stage digital startups will focus on creating and recombining new resources; constantly creating internal tensions that break the business model's internal consistency and complementarities; and triggering complexity. The cross-case analysis also showed a pattern common to all the startups, in the form of a strong entrepreneurial and innovative orga-nizational culture, supported by clear vision, the founders' driving role, cross-functional and multidimensional teams and informal, and cus- tomer feedback-centric information ﬂows. This dimension constitutes a contextual factor that permeates throughout the whole framework. Inline with this, we propose the following: Proposition 4. A strong Entrepreneurial and Innovative organizational culture fosters BMI in early stage digital startups, irrespectively of the level of environmental dynamism and the role played by the startup has when faced with this dynamism. Beyond the seven overarching dimensions, we enriched the frame- work by including the three domains whose relationships we were ex- ploring: (A) Business Model Innovation; (B) Lean Startup Approaches; and (C) Agile Development. These domains frequently emerged during our interviews, with speci ﬁc reference to the question on the metho- dology, --- a promising research avenue that will call for further academic contribution. In order to pave the way for future studies and foster cumulative theorizing, we also develop a set of propositions that can act as a research agenda, and point towards the opportunity of com- plementing knowledge in the BMI, LSAs and AD ﬁelds. The resulting value for practice takes the form of identifying the core steps and constituent elements that digital entrepreneurs should consider carefully and deploy in the early stages of their startup's de- velopment. Learning how these steps and the elements of value crea- tion, delivery and capture become more or less relevant as the context changes can help entrepreneurs to direct their e ﬀorts and allot their traditionally scarce resources e ﬀectively. Moreover, by recognizing that they can select from a pool of combinable lean and agile approaches and methods - e.g. MVP and minimal upfront testing; iterative “feed- back and change ”loops; and Scrum's sprints to restrict the duration of MVP testing by introducing a time box - to support innovation not only to their products, but also to their business model, o ﬀers digital en- trepreneurs a wider range of operational and strategic options that canbe put to use in the practice of both operational and Strategic Agility.

Se proponen una serie de proposiciones que buscan guiar futuros estudios para integrar estos conceptos y explorar sus relaciones de manera más profunda. Se destaca cómo las LSAs pueden ser utilizadas como métodos ágiles para facilitar la Innovación del Modelo de Negocio en el Emprendimiento Digital, especialmente en entornos dinámicos.

Se enfatiza la importancia de comprender la interacción entre BMI, LSAs y AD en el contexto del emprendimiento digital, con el objetivo de inspirar investigaciones adicionales en esta área y ayudar a las startups a prosperar en el cambiante panorama digital. Se discute la aplicación de métodos ágiles en el desarrollo de software, resaltando la importancia de la interacción, la entrega incremental de software funcional, la colaboración con los clientes y la capacidad de respuesta al cambio. Se mencionan varios métodos ágiles populares, como Extreme Programming, Scrum, Kanban, Lean y Feature-Driven Development, y se destaca la relación entre lean y ágil, señalando que la agilidad incluye la "leaneza" como un atributo clave.

Se describe un estudio de caso realizado con los fundadores de una startup digital y el Vicepresidente de Marketing, donde se analizaron los procesos de innovación del modelo de negocio en las primeras etapas de desarrollo de la empresa. Se identificaron siete dimensiones clave que influyen en la innovación del modelo de negocio en las startups digitales, incluyendo la agilidad operativa y estratégica, la cultura organizacional emprendedora e innovadora, y la importancia de experimentar y probar el modelo de negocio en su totalidad.

Se proponen varias proposiciones basadas en los hallazgos del estudio, destacando la importancia de la agilidad operativa y estratégica, así como la influencia de la cultura organizacional en la innovación del modelo de negocio en las startups digitales. Se sugiere que la combinación de métodos ágiles y lean puede apoyar la innovación en productos y modelos de negocio. En resumen, el estudio proporciona una visión detallada de los procesos de innovación del modelo de negocio en las startups digitales, resaltando la importancia de la agilidad operativa y estratégica, así como de una cultura organizacional emprendedora e innovadora.
