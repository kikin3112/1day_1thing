In November 2022, OpenAI, a San Francisco-based lab that develops arti ﬁcial in- telligence (AI) technologies, released a powerful conversational chatbot called ChatGPT for public use ( OpenAI, 2022 ). It became the most rapidly adopted consumer product in history ( Hu, 2023 ), with its website registering 1.8 billion visits in April 2023 ( Nerdynav, 2023 ). Its impact on early adopters ’performance was immediately apparent, with Microsoft, OpenAI ’s chief funder, reporting a signi ﬁcant increase in their Bing search engine visits in February 2023 after integrating ChatGPT capabilities(Carr, 2023 ). The global adoption of ChatGPT has demonstrated a wide range of uses for the technology, from information acquisition an d software development and testing, to writing poetry and generating ideas for birthday parties. ChatGPT is but one example of generative AI-based products with new capabilities emerging weekly ( Wardini, 2023 ). While ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot, many AI t ools are directed at research and education in a more specialized manner. Researchers and students can make use of readily availabletools to facilitate scholarly tasks, including s earching and mapping ar ticles (e.g., Research Rabbit, VosViewer and Elicit), summarizing and understanding those articles (e.g., Scholarcy, SciSpace), analyz ing data (e.g., RTutor), acade mic writing assistance (e.g., Grammarly, Magic Write, Wr itefull), and even presentin g their work in a more vivid manner (e.g., Midjourney, DALL-E). In education, students discovered that ChatGPT and its extensions can be quite helpful with essays and other assignments, while their teachers started using it in lectures and exam preparatio ns. Educators and administrators also started sounding the alarm bells, noting the potentia l of these tools to be used by their students to a v o i dl e a r n i n ga n dt os u b m i tw o r kg e n e r a t e db yA Ia st h e i ro w n .

kg e n e r a t e db yA Ia st h e i ro w n . While the mass-scale use of AI tools by consumers is a novel phenomenon, many businesses already use AI tools by integrating them, for example with their websitesand social media channels to offer personalized customer support. Several companies even built or upgraded their commercial AI products for different industries and use cases, following GPT-3 release ( Bhattacharyya, 2022 ). Big tech leaders such as Google, Microsoft and Meta integrate AI tools into their products and services ( Reuters, 2023 ), highlighting how the ﬂood of novel AI technologies and applications ( Wardini, 2023 )i s transforming the business sector. The rapid evolution, application and ubiquity of AI tools show how individuals, companies, and industries experiment with AI tools for different purposes, eyeing theirpromised bene ﬁts (Berg et al., 2023 ). It seems our world has entered a paradigm shift that mirrors the beginning of a new era not seen since the dawn of the internet. As entrepreneurship educators, we are pushed to the frontline of this development,mandated to embrace this transformative innovation to not only educate our studentsbut also use its potential to reshape our classrooms. Neither banning nor uncriticallyadopting generative AI tools will help us maximize their bene ﬁts while minimizing their downsides. Instead, we must increase our experience and leverage our conceptualcapabilities to advance our understanding. Entrepreneurship Education and Pedagogy (EE&P) is “tasked to bridge the gap between our understanding of [entrepreneurship education] with regard to what we580 Entrepreneurship Education and Pedagogy 6(4)
teach (content), how we teach (methods), who we teach (audience), and for what purpose (impact) ”(Liguori et al., 2018 , p. 6). We therefore believe that EE&P must play an essential role in shaping our understanding of how the present paradigm shift brought on by generative AI will impact varied aspects of entrepreneurship, education,and research. To this end, this editorial: ·Invites the larger entrepreneurship education community to innovate, experi- ment, and learn in order to advance our theoretical and practical understanding ofgenerative AI ’s present and future impact on our ﬁeld. ·Presents a series of inquiry questions to help guide our community to advance ourﬁeld through rigorous research and impactful learning innovations. Generative AI Overview Generative AI, the latest breakthrough in AI, machine learning and big data, can perform a vast variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It refers to a class ofAI that focuses on generating new data or content that ﬁts a given dataset ’s probability distribution. Unlike other areas of AI research that focus on classi ﬁcation or prediction, generative AI aims to create new outputs based on learning the underlying patterns and structures within observed data. Data leveraged in the training of generative AI modelsmay include text (such as ChatGPT-4), images, audio ﬁles, video ﬁles, or multi-modal ﬁles, which then generate corresponding outputs. Much of the excitement about generative AI stems from the fact that an estimated 80% of the world ’s data is un- structured, not ﬁtting into rows and columns in spreadsheets ( Harbert, 2021 ). Thus, generative AI represents an explosion of data use and human creativity in exploitingavailable data. Recent dramatic advances in generative AI have stemmed from the pairing of deep multi-layered neural networks, also known as deep learning, and massive-scale datasets. These paired breakthroughs, combined with the transformer architecture ( Vaswani et al., 2017 ), have
paired breakthroughs, combined with the transformer architecture ( Vaswani et al., 2017 ), have enabled companies such as Google, Meta, and OpenAI to build massively capable foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ability tointeract conversationally on a shocking range of topics. ChatGPT-4, OpenAI ’s most recent model, has 175 billion parameters, or individual weights in the neural network, capturing patterns and structures across a vast trove of text sources ( OpenAI, 2023 ). The model was trained on an expansive range of un- disclosed datasets, including websites, books and other text, allowing it to understandand generate human-like text across a wide range of subjects. ChatGPT-4 can un-derstand and generate text in multiple languages, making it useful to a global audience.A so-called foundational model, ChatGPT-4 can be ﬁne-tuned to speci ﬁc tasks or industries. Indeed, companies in nearly all industries are exploring the value-creationpotential of ChatGPT-4. Increasingly, ChatGPT has been leveraged in educationalsettings, assisting in creating instructional materials, aiding researchers in information synthesis and analysis, and providing personalized tutoring in various subjects. WhileWinkler et al. 581
some view AI as an existential threat to critical thinking, other prominent educators argue that generative AI may be able to dramatically improve learning outcomes ( TED, 2023 ). OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google (Bard), and Anthropic (Claude) have all put measures in place to prevent malicious use and to mitigate biases in their models, althoughchallenges remain in ensuring that the technology is used responsibly. The value of thegenerative output from large language models itself is a topic of debate, with someresearchers arguing that LLMs are in fact a deceptive, or even potentially dangerousrisk given the model ’s ability to put forth an illusion of insight, sentience and un- derstanding where no actual model of the world exists ( Bender et al., 2021 ;Chomsky et al., 2023 ). These risks are with the users themselves, who may impute human-type cognition and understanding in working collaboratively with AI models. Generative AI and Entrepreneurship Education Research and Practice To help advance our ﬁeld through research and practice in entrepreneurship education, we introduce a contextual framework to guide entrepreneurship educators, researchers, and practitioners to better understand the emerging generative AI landscape in en-trepreneurship education (see Figure 1 ). The framework highlights that work in the Research and Learning Innovation sections of Entrepreneurship Education & Pedagogyoperates at the intersection of entrepreneurship, research and education. All three areimpacted by generative AI, which affects the domain itself, how we research thedomain, and how we learn and master the domain. Regarding entrepreneurship as apractice, generative AI tools can be applied in any functional business domain (e.g., Marketing, Finance, Operations, HRM), and offer bene ﬁts at each phase of the en- trepreneurial process (generating ideas for opportunities, gathering and assessing re-sources, launching, growing and exiting the venture). Generative AI tools can beinvolved in
re-sources, launching, growing and exiting the venture). Generative AI tools can beinvolved in all phases of the research process (research design, data collection, dataanalysis, and - particularly - reporting). Finally, generative AI tools affect educationalpractices in terms of learning processes and the assessment of outcomes. Teachers andstudents must adjust to the new reality of teaching and learning in which each will have(a family of) digital assistants. As such, the framework shows the complexity as well as the scope of how generative AI will affect our journal ’s domain, which operates at the intersection of three moving targets. To help our community engage with incorporating generative AI tools in our learning innovations and studying the opportunities and challenges of generative AI forourﬁeld in our research designs, the following section offers several questions or- ganized across lines of inquiry in the areas of entrepreneurship, research, and education.These questions are a result of several rounds of brainstorming and discussion amongthe authors, supported by ChatGPT, and informed by selected literature (notably, Dwivedi et al., 2023 ).582 Entrepreneurship Education and Pedagogy 6(4)
Generative AI and Entrepreneurship Generative AI is reshaping entrepreneurship functions (e.g., marketing ﬁnance, HR) as well as core processes (e.g., oppo rtunity recognition, bu siness modeling, resource marshaling). AI technologies such as ChatGPT can help ﬁrms and startups add revenues, differentiate products and services, reduce costs, optimize risks, innovate offerings and transform their societies, as conceptualized in Mithas ’ ADROIT framework ( Dwivedi et al., 2023 ). Hence, in their (future) work lives, entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship st udents alike will want to use the latest AI technologies on the market. Entrepreneur ial practice is the ultimate determinant as well as the focus of entrepreneurship education research and learning. We proposethe following questions to inform our lin es of inquiry within the larger entrepre- neurship domain, which, for the purposes of our journal, need to be related to theaims and purpose of EE&P. 1. How will entrepreneurs exploit generative AI as a transformative technology to create new value? What new types of entrepreneurial opportunities will emergeand/or be created? 2. How are entrepreneurial behavior and cognition evolving due to the availability and use of emergent AI tools? 3. Where and in what ways might generative AI reshape core entrepreneurial functions (e.g., marketing, ﬁnance, HR) and processes (e.g., opportunity rec- ognition, business modeling, resource marshaling)? Figure 1. Context of generative AI in entrepreneurship education.Winkler et al. 583
4. When is AI more suitable to take more simple roles in entrepreneurial teams, such as research assistant and text editor; and when more sophisticated roles, such as innovator and product developer? ( Dwivedi et al., 2023 ). Generative AI and Entrepreneurship Research With the emergence of generative AI, we call for new lines of inquiry and explorations of theoretical and methodological horizons. This may require bold approaches toaddress research and practice gaps, given the present paradigm shift, and which maychallenge our current understanding of entrepreneurship. It also concerns the researchprocess itself, as generative AI technology can be expected to increasingly affect allstages of the scienti ﬁc process ( Van Dis et al., 2023 ). We propose the following inquiry questions to guide our conversation: 5. How will generative AI enable new horizons in entrepreneurship research and in entrepreneurship education research speci ﬁcally? 6. What existing theories can inform the study of generative AI in entrepre- neurship, and where is theory development needed to address critical gaps? 7. How can generative AI facilitate the examination of new measures and con- structs in entrepreneurship research, including new ways to interrogate, relateand visualize entrepreneurship phenomena? 8. How will generative AI in ﬂuence entrepreneurship education research projects and collaborations, including task distribution, data acquisition and analysis, and writing? Generative AI and Entrepreneurship Education Generative AI is conceptualized to have several bene ﬁts towards improving learning outcomes, increasing the ef ﬁciency of the educational process, and supporting a student-centered approach. It can help improve essential entrepreneurial skills such ascritical thinking, self-re ﬂection, and knowledge application among students. On the educator side, it can help with material preparation, designing assignments and sug-gesting experiential activities. The speed and ef ﬁciency
designing assignments and sug-gesting experiential activities. The speed and ef ﬁciency of AI tools allow educators to develop teaching formats and materials that were previously too time-consuming to produce ( Mollick & Mollick, 2022 ). At the same time, it is feared that AI tools can facilitate cheating and plagiarism, diminish students ’cognitive abilities, and substitute for learning and lecturers ( Kasneci et al., 2023 ;Terwiesch, 2023 ). Given the com- plexities of the potential impact on our ﬁeld, we offer several inquiry questions, ranging from general questions tobest practices and applications ;drivers and policies; and ethical challenges regarding accountability, bias, diversity and inclusion, privacy and security.584 Entrepreneurship Education and Pedagogy 6(4)
General Questions. Generative AI will require entrepreneurship trainers and educators to re-evaluate their teaching practices and perhaps consider novel ones. Generative AI will enable neoteric ways of learning in formal and informal settings as (budding) entrepreneurs will be able to call on a range of AI-enabled digital assistants. Somequestions to inform our lines of inquiry within the larger entrepreneurship educationdomain are as follows: 9. How are emergent generative AI tools supporting and challenging past and present teaching paradigms in entrepreneurship education, including the role ofthe educator and the student? 10. How can generative AI support the work of entrepreneurship educators in the preparation, delivery, and assessment of entrepreneurship courses? 11. How will generative AI impact entrepreneurial learning in informal settings? 12. How does the use of generative AI in entrepreneurship education compare to traditional teaching methods in terms of effectiveness and ef ﬁciency? 13. How will entrepreneurship education (re-)prioritize students ’skills when leveraging this new teaching paradigm across different educational levels? 14. Do generative AI tools independently generate novelty (in terms of entre- preneurship, education, and/or research), or does it merely regurgitate –or something in between ( “regurgenerate ”,Dwivedi et al., 2023 )? 15. How can entrepreneurship educators stay abreast of rapidly evolving devel- opments in generative AI and AI more generally? Best Practices and Applications. Ultimately, the learning innovation section of EE&P aims to present impactful novel approac hes to teaching and learning entrepre- neurship and we expect generative AI to spur a range of pedagogical innovations in the upcoming years. At the same time possible challenges and limitations must be acknowledged and addressed. Generative AI has the potential to promote anddeteriorate students ’learning skills more generally, particularly their creative,
to promote anddeteriorate students ’learning skills more generally, particularly their creative, critical thinking, and writing skills. The following questions may help createlearning innovations that generate pos itive economic, cultural, social and eco- logical value. 16. How can entrepreneurship educators leverage generative AI to design pow- erful, new learning experiences for students? 17. How can entrepreneurship educators use generative AI to provide learning experiences speci ﬁc to individual learners or particular groups of learners (e.g., neurodiverse)? 18. What skills, resources, and capabilities are needed to handle generative AI in the context of entrepreneurship education? 19. How can we assess the effectiveness of generative AI tools in terms of student learning and performance processes?Winkler et al. 585
20. How can generative AI technologies be utilized to foster the engagement of entrepreneurship students in online, of ﬂine, and hybrid learning environments? 21. How might generative AI in educational settings augment human creativity and group creativity in the context of entrepreneurial value creation? 22. How can generative AI support the development and re ﬁnement of entre- preneurial ideas in entrepreneurship courses and programs through rapidprototyping and testing? 23. What theoretical frameworks and practical tools can help to address and mitigate risks associated with misuse, plagiarism, and distortion in AI-enhanced entrepreneurship education? 24. How to prevent the use of AI tools from limiting the development and ap- plication of entrepreneurship students ’creativity, independent thinking and language expression skills? 25. How can entrepreneurship educators prevent the use of AI tools for creating unproductive or destructive forms of entrepreneurship? Drivers and Policies. Entrepreneurship training and courses are typically embedded in a broader institutional context. The use and adoption of generative AI for student learningand assessment need to be supported by policies and frameworks that are helpful toteachers and students and promote innovation adoption. 26. What are the drivers of generative AI adoption for innovation (economic, technological, and social) and education? 27. What programmatic and course policies promote the innovative and ethical use of AI in entrepreneurship education? 28. What frameworks can guide experimentation with generative AI in entre- preneurship education? Accountability, Bias, Diversity and Inclusion, Privacy and Security. Many authors have pointed out that the use of generative AI raises ethical issues of accountability, bias, anddiversity and inclusion ( Dwivedi et al., 2023 ). Some AI tools are currently unable to show the sources and underlying logic producing their output. Moreover, tech com- panies that release AI
the sources and underlying logic producing their output. Moreover, tech com- panies that release AI tools are reluctant or unwilling to reveal their algorithms in orderto maintain their competitive advantage. Moreover, the information that AI algorithms use to predict words and sentences may itself contain biases, even if unwittingly, which are then reproduced in generativeAI’s output ( Akter et al., 2021 ;Levy & Liguori, 2023 ). Issues of diversity and inclusion not only relate to the data used by generative AI but also to having access to the bestpossible tools. This will particularly become a concern when the paid and free versions diverge sharply in terms of the bene ﬁts they offer and how these bene ﬁts may impact certain groups and demographics differentially. Finally, signi ﬁcant questions have also emerged about data privacy and security.586 Entrepreneurship Education and Pedagogy 6(4)
29. What ethical questions does the application of generative AI to entrepre- neurship and entrepreneurship education raise? 30. What are the theoretical considerations around the ethical use, accountability, and potential bias of generative AI in entrepreneurship education? 31. How can we ensure that systemic bias and inequities will not be further perpetuated with the application of AI in entrepreneurship education? 32. How can AI potentially support more equitable entrepreneurship education?33. Will generative AI “democratize ”entrepreneurship education and its avail- ability, or will it heighten inequality and access to technology? 34. What (theoretical) approaches can be used to ensure AI promotes diversity, equity and inclusion in entrepreneurship education? 35. What theory and practical measures can guide the development of robust measures to protect student data privacy and security in AI-integrated en-trepreneurship education? Conclusion Generative AI brings promising new opportun ities to support idea generation and concept development, market and customer insight ga thering, and the rapid prototyping of en- trepreneurial ideas. M oreover, the computati onal capabilities and knowledge resource- fulness of AI applications will also have import ant implications for entrepreneurial learning given the high level of uncertainty and complexit y that characterize ent repreneurial realities (Fayolle, 2018 ;Neck & Greene, 2011 ). Still, many questions remain. This editorial is intended as a guide to help us navigate the fro ntiers of the new developments in generative AI during this unprecedented paradigm shift in entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education. EE&P is looking forward to publishing research articles and learning inno- vations in this space. Therefore, we call for o ur community of entrepreneurship scholars, educators, and prac titioners to push our ﬁeld forward by exploring, trying (and failing), and investigating this new “humanized ”technology.
ﬁeld forward by exploring, trying (and failing), and investigating this new “humanized ”technology. We hope our framework and associated inquiry questions will support and advance exc iting lines of inquiry and facilitate a larger conversation about opportunities and challenges presented by advances in generative AIthat were previously inconceivable.

ChatGPT is but one example of generative AI-based products with new capabilities emerging weekly ( Wardini, 2023 ). While ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot, many AI t ools are directed at research and education in a more specialized manner. Researchers and students can make use of readily availabletools to facilitate scholarly tasks, including s earching and mapping ar ticles (e.g., Research Rabbit, VosViewer and Elicit), summarizing and understanding those articles (e.g., Scholarcy, SciSpace), analyz ing data (e.g., RTutor), acade mic writing assistance (e.g., Grammarly, Magic Write, Wr itefull), and even presentin g their work in a more vivid manner (e.g., Midjourney, DALL-E). In education, students discovered that ChatGPT and its extensions can be quite helpful with essays and other assignments, while their teachers started using it in lectures and exam preparatio ns. Educators and administrators also started sounding the alarm bells, noting the potentia l of these tools to be used by their students to a v o i dl e a r n i n ga n dt os u b m i tw o r kg e n e r a t e db yA Ia st h e i ro w n .

kg e n e r a t e db yA Ia st h e i ro w n . While the mass-scale use of AI tools by consumers is a novel phenomenon, many businesses already use AI tools by integrating them, for example with their websitesand social media channels to offer personalized customer support. Several companies even built or upgraded their commercial AI products for different industries and use cases, following GPT-3 release ( Bhattacharyya, 2022 ). Big tech leaders such as Google, Microsoft and Meta integrate AI tools into their products and services ( Reuters, 2023 ), highlighting how the ﬂood of novel AI technologies and applications ( Wardini, 2023 )i s transforming the business sector. The rapid evolution, application and ubiquity of AI tools show how individuals, companies, and industries experiment with AI tools for different purposes, eyeing theirpromised bene ﬁts (Berg et al., 2023 ). It seems our world has entered a paradigm shift that mirrors the beginning of a new era not seen since the dawn of the internet. As entrepreneurship educators, we are pushed to the frontline of this development,mandated to embrace this transformative innovation to not only educate our studentsbut also use its potential to reshape our classrooms. Neither banning nor uncriticallyadopting generative AI tools will help us maximize their bene ﬁts while minimizing their downsides. Instead, we must increase our experience and leverage our conceptualcapabilities to advance our understanding. Entrepreneurship Education and Pedagogy (EE&P) is “tasked to bridge the gap between our understanding of [entrepreneurship education] with regard to what we580 Entrepreneurship Education and Pedagogy 6(4)
teach (content), how we teach (methods), who we teach (audience), and for what purpose (impact) ”(Liguori et al., 2018 , p. 6). We therefore believe that EE&P must play an essential role in shaping our understanding of how the present paradigm shift brought on by generative AI will impact varied aspects of entrepreneurship, education,and research. To this end, this editorial: ·Invites the larger entrepreneurship education community to innovate, experi- ment, and learn in order to advance our theoretical and practical understanding ofgenerative AI ’s present and future impact on our ﬁeld. ·Presents a series of inquiry questions to help guide our community to advance ourﬁeld through rigorous research and impactful learning innovations. Generative AI Overview Generative AI, the latest breakthrough in AI, machine learning and big data, can perform a vast variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It refers to a class ofAI that focuses on generating new data or content that ﬁts a given dataset ’s probability distribution. Unlike other areas of AI research that focus on classi ﬁcation or prediction, generative AI aims to create new outputs based on learning the underlying patterns and structures within observed data. Data leveraged in the training of generative AI modelsmay include text (such as ChatGPT-4), images, audio ﬁles, video ﬁles, or multi-modal ﬁles, which then generate corresponding outputs. Much of the excitement about generative AI stems from the fact that an estimated 80% of the world ’s data is un- structured, not ﬁtting into rows and columns in spreadsheets ( Harbert, 2021 ). Thus, generative AI represents an explosion of data use and human creativity in exploitingavailable data. Recent dramatic advances in generative AI have stemmed from the pairing of deep multi-layered neural networks, also known as deep learning, and massive-scale datasets. These paired breakthroughs, combined with the transformer architecture ( Vaswani et al., 2017 ), have
paired breakthroughs, combined with the transformer architecture ( Vaswani et al., 2017 ), have enabled companies such as Google, Meta, and OpenAI to build massively capable foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ability tointeract conversationally on a shocking range of topics. ChatGPT-4, OpenAI ’s most recent model, has 175 billion parameters, or individual weights in the neural network, capturing patterns and structures across a vast trove of text sources ( OpenAI, 2023 ). The model was trained on an expansive range of un- disclosed datasets, including websites, books and other text, allowing it to understandand generate human-like text across a wide range of subjects. ChatGPT-4 can un-derstand and generate text in multiple languages, making it useful to a global audience.A so-called foundational model, ChatGPT-4 can be ﬁne-tuned to speci ﬁc tasks or industries. Indeed, companies in nearly all industries are exploring the value-creationpotential of ChatGPT-4. Increasingly, ChatGPT has been leveraged in educationalsettings, assisting in creating instructional materials, aiding researchers in information synthesis and analysis, and providing personalized tutoring in various subjects. WhileWinkler et al. 581
some view AI as an existential threat to critical thinking, other prominent educators argue that generative AI may be able to dramatically improve learning outcomes ( TED, 2023 ). OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google (Bard), and Anthropic (Claude) have all put measures in place to prevent malicious use and to mitigate biases in their models, althoughchallenges remain in ensuring that the technology is used responsibly. The value of thegenerative output from large language models itself is a topic of debate, with someresearchers arguing that LLMs are in fact a deceptive, or even potentially dangerousrisk given the model ’s ability to put forth an illusion of insight, sentience and un- derstanding where no actual model of the world exists ( Bender et al., 2021 ;Chomsky et al., 2023 ). These risks are with the users themselves, who may impute human-type cognition and understanding in working collaboratively with AI models. Generative AI and Entrepreneurship Education Research and Practice To help advance our ﬁeld through research and practice in entrepreneurship education, we introduce a contextual framework to guide entrepreneurship educators, researchers, and practitioners to better understand the emerging generative AI landscape in en-trepreneurship education (see Figure 1 ). The framework highlights that work in the Research and Learning Innovation sections of Entrepreneurship Education & Pedagogyoperates at the intersection of entrepreneurship, research and education. All three areimpacted by generative AI, which affects the domain itself, how we research thedomain, and how we learn and master the domain. Regarding entrepreneurship as apractice, generative AI tools can be applied in any functional business domain (e.g., Marketing, Finance, Operations, HRM), and offer bene ﬁts at each phase of the en- trepreneurial process (generating ideas for opportunities, gathering and assessing re-sources, launching, growing and exiting the venture). Generative AI tools can beinvolved in
re-sources, launching, growing and exiting the venture). Generative AI tools can beinvolved in all phases of the research process (research design, data collection, dataanalysis, and - particularly - reporting). Finally, generative AI tools affect educationalpractices in terms of learning processes and the assessment of outcomes. Teachers andstudents must adjust to the new reality of teaching and learning in which each will have(a family of) digital assistants. As such, the framework shows the complexity as well as the scope of how generative AI will affect our journal ’s domain, which operates at the intersection of three moving targets. To help our community engage with incorporating generative AI tools in our learning innovations and studying the opportunities and challenges of generative AI forourﬁeld in our research designs, the following section offers several questions or- ganized across lines of inquiry in the areas of entrepreneurship, research, and education.These questions are a result of several rounds of brainstorming and discussion amongthe authors, supported by ChatGPT, and informed by selected literature (notably, Dwivedi et al., 2023 ).582 Entrepreneurship Education and Pedagogy 6(4)
Generative AI and Entrepreneurship Generative AI is reshaping entrepreneurship functions (e.g., marketing ﬁnance, HR) as well as core processes (e.g., oppo rtunity recognition, bu siness modeling, resource marshaling). AI technologies such as ChatGPT can help ﬁrms and startups add revenues, differentiate products and services, reduce costs, optimize risks, innovate offerings and transform their societies, as conceptualized in Mithas ’ ADROIT framework ( Dwivedi et al., 2023 ). Hence, in their (future) work lives, entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship st udents alike will want to use the latest AI technologies on the market. Entrepreneur ial practice is the ultimate determinant as well as the focus of entrepreneurship education research and learning. We proposethe following questions to inform our lin es of inquiry within the larger entrepre- neurship domain, which, for the purposes of our journal, need to be related to theaims and purpose of EE&P. 1. How will entrepreneurs exploit generative AI as a transformative technology to create new value? What new types of entrepreneurial opportunities will emergeand/or be created? 2. How are entrepreneurial behavior and cognition evolving due to the availability and use of emergent AI tools? 3. Where and in what ways might generative AI reshape core entrepreneurial functions (e.g., marketing, ﬁnance, HR) and processes (e.g., opportunity rec- ognition, business modeling, resource marshaling)? Figure 1. Context of generative AI in entrepreneurship education.Winkler et al. 583
4. When is AI more suitable to take more simple roles in entrepreneurial teams, such as research assistant and text editor; and when more sophisticated roles, such as innovator and product developer? ( Dwivedi et al., 2023 ). Generative AI and Entrepreneurship Research With the emergence of generative AI, we call for new lines of inquiry and explorations of theoretical and methodological horizons. This may require bold approaches toaddress research and practice gaps, given the present paradigm shift, and which maychallenge our current understanding of entrepreneurship. It also concerns the researchprocess itself, as generative AI technology can be expected to increasingly affect allstages of the scienti ﬁc process ( Van Dis et al., 2023 ). We propose the following inquiry questions to guide our conversation: 5. How will generative AI enable new horizons in entrepreneurship research and in entrepreneurship education research speci ﬁcally? 6. What existing theories can inform the study of generative AI in entrepre- neurship, and where is theory development needed to address critical gaps? 7. How can generative AI facilitate the examination of new measures and con- structs in entrepreneurship research, including new ways to interrogate, relateand visualize entrepreneurship phenomena? 8. How will generative AI in ﬂuence entrepreneurship education research projects and collaborations, including task distribution, data acquisition and analysis, and writing? Generative AI and Entrepreneurship Education Generative AI is conceptualized to have several bene ﬁts towards improving learning outcomes, increasing the ef ﬁciency of the educational process, and supporting a student-centered approach. It can help improve essential entrepreneurial skills such ascritical thinking, self-re ﬂection, and knowledge application among students. On the educator side, it can help with material preparation, designing assignments and sug-gesting experiential activities. The speed and ef ﬁciency
designing assignments and sug-gesting experiential activities. The speed and ef ﬁciency of AI tools allow educators to develop teaching formats and materials that were previously too time-consuming to produce ( Mollick & Mollick, 2022 ). At the same time, it is feared that AI tools can facilitate cheating and plagiarism, diminish students ’cognitive abilities, and substitute for learning and lecturers ( Kasneci et al., 2023 ;Terwiesch, 2023 ). Given the com- plexities of the potential impact on our ﬁeld, we offer several inquiry questions, ranging from general questions tobest practices and applications ;drivers and policies; and ethical challenges regarding accountability, bias, diversity and inclusion, privacy and security.584 Entrepreneurship Education and Pedagogy 6(4)
General Questions. Generative AI will require entrepreneurship trainers and educators to re-evaluate their teaching practices and perhaps consider novel ones. Generative AI will enable neoteric ways of learning in formal and informal settings as (budding) entrepreneurs will be able to call on a range of AI-enabled digital assistants. Somequestions to inform our lines of inquiry within the larger entrepreneurship educationdomain are as follows: 9. How are emergent generative AI tools supporting and challenging past and present teaching paradigms in entrepreneurship education, including the role ofthe educator and the student? 10. How can generative AI support the work of entrepreneurship educators in the preparation, delivery, and assessment of entrepreneurship courses? 11. How will generative AI impact entrepreneurial learning in informal settings? 12. How does the use of generative AI in entrepreneurship education compare to traditional teaching methods in terms of effectiveness and ef ﬁciency? 13. How will entrepreneurship education (re-)prioritize students ’skills when leveraging this new teaching paradigm across different educational levels? 14. Do generative AI tools independently generate novelty (in terms of entre- preneurship, education, and/or research), or does it merely regurgitate –or something in between ( “regurgenerate ”,Dwivedi et al., 2023 )? 15. How can entrepreneurship educators stay abreast of rapidly evolving devel- opments in generative AI and AI more generally? Best Practices and Applications. Ultimately, the learning innovation section of EE&P aims to present impactful novel approac hes to teaching and learning entrepre- neurship and we expect generative AI to spur a range of pedagogical innovations in the upcoming years. At the same time possible challenges and limitations must be acknowledged and addressed. Generative AI has the potential to promote anddeteriorate students ’learning skills more generally, particularly their creative,
to promote anddeteriorate students ’learning skills more generally, particularly their creative, critical thinking, and writing skills. The following questions may help createlearning innovations that generate pos itive economic, cultural, social and eco- logical value. 16. How can entrepreneurship educators leverage generative AI to design pow- erful, new learning experiences for students? 17. How can entrepreneurship educators use generative AI to provide learning experiences speci ﬁc to individual learners or particular groups of learners (e.g., neurodiverse)? 18. What skills, resources, and capabilities are needed to handle generative AI in the context of entrepreneurship education? 19. How can we assess the effectiveness of generative AI tools in terms of student learning and performance processes?Winkler et al. 585
20. How can generative AI technologies be utilized to foster the engagement of entrepreneurship students in online, of ﬂine, and hybrid learning environments? 21. How might generative AI in educational settings augment human creativity and group creativity in the context of entrepreneurial value creation? 22. How can generative AI support the development and re ﬁnement of entre- preneurial ideas in entrepreneurship courses and programs through rapidprototyping and testing? 23. What theoretical frameworks and practical tools can help to address and mitigate risks associated with misuse, plagiarism, and distortion in AI-enhanced entrepreneurship education? 24. How to prevent the use of AI tools from limiting the development and ap- plication of entrepreneurship students ’creativity, independent thinking and language expression skills? 25. How can entrepreneurship educators prevent the use of AI tools for creating unproductive or destructive forms of entrepreneurship? Drivers and Policies. Entrepreneurship training and courses are typically embedded in a broader institutional context. The use and adoption of generative AI for student learningand assessment need to be supported by policies and frameworks that are helpful toteachers and students and promote innovation adoption. 26. What are the drivers of generative AI adoption for innovation (economic, technological, and social) and education? 27. What programmatic and course policies promote the innovative and ethical use of AI in entrepreneurship education? 28. What frameworks can guide experimentation with generative AI in entre- preneurship education? Accountability, Bias, Diversity and Inclusion, Privacy and Security. Many authors have pointed out that the use of generative AI raises ethical issues of accountability, bias, anddiversity and inclusion ( Dwivedi et al., 2023 ). Some AI tools are currently unable to show the sources and underlying logic producing their output. Moreover, tech com- panies that release AI
the sources and underlying logic producing their output. Moreover, tech com- panies that release AI tools are reluctant or unwilling to reveal their algorithms in orderto maintain their competitive advantage. Moreover, the information that AI algorithms use to predict words and sentences may itself contain biases, even if unwittingly, which are then reproduced in generativeAI’s output ( Akter et al., 2021 ;Levy & Liguori, 2023 ). Issues of diversity and inclusion not only relate to the data used by generative AI but also to having access to the bestpossible tools. This will particularly become a concern when the paid and free versions diverge sharply in terms of the bene ﬁts they offer and how these bene ﬁts may impact certain groups and demographics differentially. Finally, signi ﬁcant questions have also emerged about data privacy and security.586 Entrepreneurship Education and Pedagogy 6(4)
29. What ethical questions does the application of generative AI to entrepre- neurship and entrepreneurship education raise? 30. What are the theoretical considerations around the ethical use, accountability, and potential bias of generative AI in entrepreneurship education? 31. How can we ensure that systemic bias and inequities will not be further perpetuated with the application of AI in entrepreneurship education? 32. How can AI potentially support more equitable entrepreneurship education?33. Will generative AI “democratize ”entrepreneurship education and its avail- ability, or will it heighten inequality and access to technology? 34. What (theoretical) approaches can be used to ensure AI promotes diversity, equity and inclusion in entrepreneurship education? 35. What theory and practical measures can guide the development of robust measures to protect student data privacy and security in AI-integrated en-trepreneurship education? Conclusion Generative AI brings promising new opportun ities to support idea generation and concept development, market and customer insight ga thering, and the rapid prototyping of en- trepreneurial ideas. M oreover, the computati onal capabilities and knowledge resource- fulness of AI applications will also have import ant implications for entrepreneurial learning given the high level of uncertainty and complexit y that characterize ent repreneurial realities (Fayolle, 2018 ;Neck & Greene, 2011 ). Still, many questions remain. This editorial is intended as a guide to help us navigate the fro ntiers of the new developments in generative AI during this unprecedented paradigm shift in entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education. EE&P is looking forward to publishing research articles and learning inno- vations in this space. Therefore, we call for o ur community of entrepreneurship scholars, educators, and prac titioners to push our ﬁeld forward by exploring, trying (and failing), and investigating this new “humanized ”technology.
ﬁeld forward by exploring, trying (and failing), and investigating this new “humanized ”technology. We hope our framework and associated inquiry questions will support and advance exc iting lines of inquiry and facilitate a larger conversation about opportunities and challenges presented by advances in generative AIthat were previously inconceivable.
