Keywords: Innovation; lean startup ; Customer driven production; SMEs 1.Problem statement and overall objective The world is currently experiencing global changes an d  challenges inunprecedented speed .Digital Transformation,  climate changes or social inclusion have a huge impact on our  life and concern all industries. Global competition, rapid  market changes and the need for more and faster innovations lead to a new risk situation for companies. Even th ough  challenges like thatpose a risk for companies of all sizes, SMEs  are especially exposed and vulnerable.  As dynamics increase s,the reliability of success forecasts  decreases and many of the product design innovations launched on the market fail. This is forcing compan ies to innovate more  and faster . Newsabout bankruptcies of former global players  and market leaders make visible that there is a need of change  in the way how companies deal with new ideas and how they  manage innovations. Traditiona l methods such as V - Method orWaterfall- Method are complicated as well as time consuming, expensive  and inflexible.

[1]Sadly , it is becoming increasingly common  for manufacturing companies to find that, despite well- founded  market research at the beginning of the process, the customer does not want orneed the new product , because until the  product is on the market, the market needs have change . [2] To reduce th eriskof failing customer needs, agile processes  and iterative product design areof enormous im portance . It is  crucial to constantly check whether the products meet the  demand of the market and to design the product in a variable way, so that changes can be taken up immediately and learning  effects can be implemented. Therefore, c ompanies are forced to use new methods of innovation that allow faster and more  customer oriented product development . One such method is the Lean Startup Approach . This  method is based on a constant customer feedback, iterative  testing of prototypes and continuo us improvement through  learning. Originally, it was e stablished as a way of product  development for startups, which need a very fast and effective  way of product development and are therefore forced to  optimise their initial market approach through iterati ve testing  of prototypes and continuous improvement through learningfrom customer feedback . In order to deepen this idea and in order to confirm the  initial hypothesis that the Lean Startup Approach can be  applied to large companies the authors carried ou t a preliminary  study, in which specialist literature was used to demonstrate 14th CIRP Conference on Intelligent Computation in Manufacturing Engineering, CIRP ICME '20 Investigation of the “lean startup” approach in large manufacturing  companies towards customer driven product innovation in SMEs Isabella Jesemann *, Tim Beichter, Carmen Constantinescu,  Klaus Herburger, Marc Rüger Fraunhofer IAO, Allmandring 35, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany  * Corresponding author.

The authors carried out a preliminary study which show edthat global challenges such as digital transformation are urging  companies to become more dynamic and flexible, and that this method is already used by large co mpanies to meet the needs .  Based on the preliminary study, the authors conducted in -depth interviews with experts to examine the procedure for introducing the Lean  Startup Approach in large manufacturing companies, and examined the feasibility of applying the method to SMEs. .

712 Isabella Jesemann  et al. / Procedia CIRP 99 (2021) 711 –716 that the Lean Startup Approach can also be successfully applied  to larger manufacturing companies.  To support this assumption, three global companies (Daimler AG (Germany), General Electrics (USA) and Alibaba  (China)) , which have already integrated the Lean Startup  Approach into their existing product innovation processes,  were examined and challenges and opportunities were  identified. The investigation show edthat all three comp anies  achieved great success using this approach as it enables them  to react more flexible to external influences, such as market competition, new technologie s or economical shifts , due to a  fast and direct reaction to the experiences based on customer  dialogue. 2.Approach and research methodology: overview  2.1.Hypothesis and procedure Upon confirmation that the Lean Startup Approach works  both in startups and in large companies the authors established  the hypothesis that this innovation method can deliver an  important contribution to the product development process in  SMEs and thus influence their innovation potential positively.  If this transferability is possible, the Lean Startup Approach could be an innovation method applicable to companies of a ny  size. The authors state that manufacturing companies us ingthe  Lean Startup Approach will be able to react flexibly to market  situations, as well as to innovate their production process, which can lead to a faster production process. In order to find o ut how the Lean Startup Approach can help  manufacturing companies become more agile, flexible and faster, and for the sake of gaining the best possible insight of  the topic the authors defined a methodology of investigation in  four main phases: Phase I: Preliminary study aiming at definition of the  research goal and determination of the research method,  furthermore a literature research regarding state of the art  of the research topic and
method,  furthermore a literature research regarding state of the art  of the research topic and identification of challenges, chances and possible benefits. Phase II:Expert interviews to examine in detail the  procedure for introducing the Lean Startup Approach in  their company. Description of the Lean Startup Approachin its qualities and possible applications. Transfer of the  research results of the preliminary st udy and the findings  from the expert interviews to the needs and circumstances of SMEs.  Phase III: Conception of a method for customization of the  Lean Startup Approach to SMEs. Pilot- implementation of  the concept with a selected medium -sized company and  evaluation.   Phase IV: Final works: Validation, refinement and final  conclusion. Publication.In the following the authors present the results of the second  phase of the study consisting of a performed empirical study  with field investigation aiming at validating the above stated hypothesis and delivering a concept for the migration of the Lean Startup Approach to SMEs.2.2. Approach and methodology  The authors chose qualitative expert interviews as primary  data gathering method to collect information regarding experiences , convictions and opinions from experts, who have  applied th eLean Startup Approach in large manufacturing  companies. This method is particularly suitable for gathering  background information and tapping into an expert's  knowledge of a particular subject. In accordance with Adams [4] interviews can generally be  placed on a continuum of structure, from “unstructured” to highly “structured.”, which represents the amount of “control”  the interviewer will have over the interaction. [4]Following the  method also described by Harell et all [3]Adams [4]and Ahlin  [5] t he research group used semi -standardized interviews to  identify specific qualitative characteristics of responde nts on  the same topics and to find out about the different individual  experiences with
responde nts on  the same topics and to find out about the different individual  experiences with the implementation of the Lean Startup Approach . Conducted in form of a conversation with one  respondent at a time, this interview method employs a blend of closed- and open -ended questions, often accompanied by  follow- up “why”or “how”questions. Theinterviewers used an interview guide with topics and questions that had to be  covered, and which had been asked of all respondents. Even  though the dialogue could meander around the topics on th e  agenda and delve into totally unforeseen issues , the main  questions were always asked and answered. In order to qualify as an experts the interview partner had to  meet three criteria: They had to be employees of a large c ompany , They had to beoccupie d in a leading position with the  topic "innovation” . And  The company had to use L ean Startup Approach at least  as one of the component sin the irinnovation method  portfolio. For the evaluation, the experts were anonymized . Figure 1 shows a list of all interviewed participants with their assigned  identification number, gender, position and time in the organization.

Isabella Jesemann  et al. / Procedia CIRP 99 (2021) 711 –716 713 These criteria were important to determine the benefit of the  Lean Startup Approach in large companies, in order to  determine a possible transferability of the Lean Startup  Approach to SMEs.  The experts came from a wide range of industrial sectors. It  was important to cho ose experts from a wide range of industrial  sectors in order to find out if the method is applicable to all sectors.  In the following a ll subsequent expert statements are  provided with the corresponding identification number and can thus b e assigned directly . 3.Research output: p hase II 3.1.Study overview Over a period of two months, 15 expert interviews were  conducted with various companies worldwide. The expert  interviews were conducted by telephone in an open exchange. The time frame of the interviews varied between 20 and 60 minutes. The interviews were recorded and subseq uently  transcribed. An analysis of the interviews was then prepared on the base of the transcripts. Commonalities in content were identified and the respective statements of the interviewees were compared with each other. Existing structures were uncovered and evaluated. The semi -standardized expert  interviews were afterwards evaluated with the focus on  customer interaction in the Lean Startup Approach Since the expert interviews were conducted in an open  exchange and many different topics were discussed, the object area was limited to five main topics within the scope of this study. These main topics were :  Motivation for the introduction of the Lean S tartup  Approach. Presentation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Involvement of the customer in the product development process. Customer interaction. Applicability of the Lean Startup Approach to SMEs . In addition to the five main question groups , over 60 supplementary questions were formulated and divided into the  various sub -themes of the research topic. In this way, it was
formulated and divided into the  various sub -themes of the research topic. In this way, it was  possible to ask questions that matched the direction in which  the conversation with the respective expert had developed. 3.2.Output expert interviews In the following, the content of the expert interviews will be  examined focusing on the importance of the customer in the  innovation process. For this reason, the authors carried out a qualitative analysis, that highlights individual posit ions and  examine the corresponding citations. 3.2.1. Motivation for the introduction of the Lean Startup  Approach One of the reasons why companies gave consideration to  the Lean Startup Approach was that the methods of product development used until then have b ecome disappointing and  frustrating . Expert 3 commented on this : “We […] do have engineers who put in so much detailed work  and then develop a really great product and then notice that […]  nobody needs it.” (E3) Thus, the goal was to find a faster and more reliable way to  test as many ideas as possible. Companies needed an approach  who toimplement ideas at high speed and in high quantity ,  expert 3 pointed out . “We needed an approach that would allow us to test very  quickly, very many [...] ideas.” ( E3) Expert 15 explain edthat the traditional innovation methods,  like the waterfall -method or the V -method, had become too  slow and too rigid for the companies. Therefore, a change in innovation methods had to be made and the Lean Startup Approac h was considered. “[With] waterfall and [...] project management oriented  models, [you] realized that it all takes a very long time if you  stick with these models. ”(E15) Expert 1 brought out a third argument besides reliability and  speed: the costs. He stated that a gile innovation methods,  especially the Lean Startup Approach , hadbeen introduced in  his company to test ideas faster and cheaper. These properties gave agile innovation methods a clear advantage over
ideas faster and cheaper. These properties gave agile innovation methods a clear advantage over traditional innovation methods: “What wa s hoped for from more agile and lean methods in the  field of innovation was that through exploratory approaches,  [...] one could easily [innovate] very, very quickly and above  all very, very cheaply. [...]” ( E1) Speed pays off for companies in various way s. Since the  Lean Startup Approach makes it possible to test a lot of ideas very quickly and very cheaply, companies were able to take advantage of this and place products on the market earlier than their competitors , claimed expert 5. “Just because it is rapidly, it provides us an opportunity to go  and get things in front of the customer or partner or somebody  very quickly.” ( E5) Expert 10ultimately confirmed that the Lean Startup  Approach has accelerated the innovative product development  process in his company by weeks, often months: “When we started the new process, development was shortened  by months.” ( E10) The authors see all this statements as confirmation that the  Lean Startup Approach is of great importance for the innovation process of large companies in terms of reliability,  speed and costs.

714 Isabella Jesemann  et al. / Procedia CIRP 99 (2021) 711 –716 3.2.2. Presentation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) The MVP is a first unfinished product design, sometimes in  a partly primitive stage of development. In the process of the  Lean Startup Approach the idea of presentation of a product in  a very early stage is of great importance. At the time of  presentation to customers, the MVP might still be just a ro ugh  visualisation . In the course of the interviews many experts  stated, that the companies were highly concerned regarding presentation of a product in such an early state. Asemployees  are usually trained to give the customer the best possible  impression about their product and to cover up potential defects, so it proved difficult to present unfinished and not yet  perfect products.  Existing brands and a reputation built up over the years  often make it difficult to use a method in which a product is presented to the customer that, due to its type of prototype, does not come close to the classic standards of the company. Experts  9 and 11 claim ed, that the concern to damage the reputation of  a brand already built up was the main issue for the employees. . Theyfearedthat customers could misinterprete the MVP for  a real product , which could ultimately have a n egative impact  on the company's image.  “It is always a topic that companies are afraid of approaching  customers […] with half -finished products, because […] a  corporate has a completely different brand risk than a startup. ”  (E11) “There is a lot of issue behind our brands and you do not risk  brands that have taken in some cases a hundred years to  develop.” (E 9) However, experts 4 and 3 stated, that through open and  honest communication in which they explain edthat the product  actually is in an early stage as the goal of the method is learning  from customer feedback as well as iterating and improving the product based on that feedback, the understanding of the customers
as iterating and improving the product based on that feedback, the understanding of the customers grew considerably.  “When you go to the customer and say we want to listen to you  first, we want to learn from you […] the door is wide open and  it is always incredible how much the customers talk. ” (E3) “They are already prepared […] for the fact that it is not really  about the finished product, but that it is more about learning  from the customers. ” (E2) Therefore, to the authors it seems advisable to be well  prepared for the presentation of the MVP and undergo special  training before doing so as well as preparing the customer. If concerns of damaging the brand are still severe, expert 9  suggest edto carry out the presentation of the MVP  anonymously, so that no damage to the company would be done. “They will not necessarily know if it is a [corporate name]  product they are [testing] or not.” (9)3.2.3. Involvement of customers in the product development  process. Expert 6 observed that t he ever -recurring emphasis on the  practical aspect of the Lean Startup Approach was very close  to the experts' hearts . Since customer contact is very important  in the Lean Startup Approach, to get the necessary opinions  from customers and to react to them, employees need  experience in dealing with customers which they only can gain  in practice : „Lean startup has a lot to do with experience, becaus e you get  out of the comfort zone pretty quickly. As opposed to sitting  behind the computer and building slides forever, you have to  get out and get feedback at some point. So it's an experience.“  (E6) Statements by experts 11 or 15 show that t he involvem ent  of the customer may contribute to strengthen the relation between company and customer.  “The customers react great, of course. […] Especially because  people like to share their opinion.” (E11) “[Customers] usually [react] positively, so most of them find  this very pleasant, because […] we have […] topics
[react] positively, so most of them find  this very pleasant, because […] we have […] topics that are  very new […] and in this way they were involved very early  on.” (E15) Most experts suggested that customers reacted positively on  being involved into product development, were happy to  contribute and felthono ured for being consulted.  An open communication with the customer creates  understanding and solidarity which only can be beneficial in the future.  Nevertheless, some experts ( like expert 7) also experience  negative customer reactions .  “We also have had very different experiences with customers.  We had a workshop where the customers also said, "Say, what  am I actually doing here when I develop my product together  with you?” (E7) According to expert 2, it is also much easier if the c ustomer  already knows the method and uses it himself. “The fear [...] is not there to test a minimal viable product on a  customer, because […] our customers also start […] lean  startup […] so [it] is much easier for them to understand. ” (E10) Well- trained and prepared employees seem to be especially  important to approach customers differently and clarify their  role in the process, without raising false or too high  expectations. Therefore , the authors suggest that a part of the  preparation for the customer presentations should be dedicated  to training for such situation s.

Isabella Jesemann  et al. / Procedia CIRP 99 (2021) 711 –716 715 3.2.4. Customer interaction Many experts emphasized that the customer interaction was  extremely important. According to the experts , companies  should find the courage to send their employe es out and let  them interact with customers as often as possible . To guarantee  the customer contact, some companies have defined how many  customers the respective teams have to talk to. This was up to  100 customers in eight weeks, as reported by expert 3. “The teams must conduct at least 100 customer interviews in  [...] eight weeks.” (E3) Such statements make it obvious how time consuming a  procedure that is which requires appropriate resources . The  employees and teams need sufficient working time to main tain  this customer contact. Expert E13 suggested theemployees  being freed from their daily routine tasks, allowing them to  focus on the new task connected with the Lean Startup  Approach relevant customer interaction .  “But in order to have this […] team […] you need to be able to  release them from their daily job to allocate time on applying  the lean startup and discussing with customers […].“ (E13) The experts have come to this conclusion through their  innovation work , as customer contact proved too valuable. If  companies do not maintain close customer contact, this can  lead to the failure of an idea .Expert 15 stressed that if an  apparently innovative idea does not manage to enter into a  customer dialogue, the idea wil l usually not evolve .  “So the ideas that went really badly, even if the ideas were  good, [...] were those due to a lack of customer focus. [If] the  idea does not manage to talk to a customer in [...] 6 months [...],  be it an internal customer or an external customer, then it won't  be successful in general.” (E15) Companies must therefore be prepared to provide  employees with sufficient working time for customer contac t. All the same expert 12 warned against
employees with sufficient working time for customer contac t. All the same expert 12 warned against overstretching the  Lean Startup Approach . The company must be careful not to  flood the customer with too much information and only assign him doable and meaningful tasks. Therefore ,companies should  be careful not to overburden the individual customer and make everyone feel part of the development pro cess: „You don't do [ lean startup] too inflationary and too spam, it is  [a great] form of customer retention, if you give them the  feeling of being cocreative. […]“ ( E12) 3.2.5. Applicability of the Lean Startup Approach to SMEs. The experts confirmed that Lean Startup Approach intended  for startups worked well also in large companies. Thus it was  of great interest to the authors whether the experts believed in  the success of theLean Startup Approach being transferred to  SMEs. As SMEs have fewer human and financ ial resources than large companies the question arose if that could be an  obstacle .  The experts did not see a disadvantage regarding the size of  a company while implementing the Lean Startupo Approach .  Some experts like expert 10 and expert 14 believed that the  SMEs could benefit from the smaller size, in terms of shorter  way of communication and less distinctive bureaucratic  processes . “I think [the Lean Startup Approach] would work much better  for SMEs than for a large corporation [...].” ( E10) “Lean startup fits SMEs incredibly well and even better than  large companies.“ ( E14) Expert 10 was confident that the transferability of the Lean  Startup Approach to SMEs would not only succeed, but would  work even better for S MEs than for large companies becaus e  in his opinion strict administrative processes make it difficult  for large companies to use an innovation method such as Lean  Startup Approach effectively. “A corporation is already very, very complex and the decision - making processes can be very complicated. And the most
very, very complex and the decision - making processes can be very complicated. And the most  important thing about lean startup [...] is that the people who  have to work on the project have the authority to make  decisions, not wait for [a decision from] the 120th floor.” ( E10) Accodring to expert 11 s ome of the companies have already  started Lean Startup Approaches with SMEs of different sizes,  and the practical results were positive: “We have several SMEs with us. Starting with one SME with  100 people, up to 1000 people. And it works, it works great!”  (E11) From this, the authors interpret that the application of the  Lean Startup Approach is possible for SMEs. 4.Study results In conclusion ,theLean Startup Approach offers many  possibilities to companies. In that ,it contains some answers to  the urgent issues of the time, not only to large companies or  startups but also to SMEs. For one the Lean Startup Approach does accelerate product development, while it makes  innovation processes cheaper , more flexible and more reliable .  Through testing and validating the product in a very early  stage of development, products that will not work on the market can be spotted much earlier than with traditional innovation methods and excluded from further development. Because of  that, the risk of developing costly and time -consuming products  can be reduced, making the L ean Startup Approach a safer  innovation method than most previous ly used methods.  Another positive aspect is the possibility to apply theLean  Startup Approach in any industry. While many companies and  startups use the Lean Startup Approach for s oftware development , our investigation of experts from many different  industries suggests that it can be successfully used in traditional  This is a resupply of March 2023 as the template used in the publication of the original article contained errors.

716 Isabella Jesemann  et al. / Procedia CIRP 99 (2021) 711 –716 production, too. However, in order to implement Lean Startup  Approach companies need to be ready to change their corporate  philosophy as well as their structures to allow for more  flexibility.  Because customer involvement is crucial for applying the  Lean Startup Approach ,there is great need for traini ng  employees regarding engaging, communicating and interacting  with the c ustomers. The authors have also learned , that a solid  preparation for the presentation of an MVP to the customer is  crucial for succe eding. A well -informed customer can make the  difference between getting much needed customer feedback or  failing to do so.  The interviews have shown , that beside the obvious benefits  of getting customer feedback, successfully conducted customer involvement can also lead to a rise in sympathy towards the company and improve customer relations. A large preexisting  customer isadvantageous but is not crucial for applying the  Lean ean Startup Approach, as during the process, new  customers can be gained . As a result, a time -intensive and  profound customer contact must be established , continuously cultivated and maintained . This absorbs capabilities what may  be a challenge especially for smaller companies. Nevertheless, the experts agree d that the L ean Startup  Approach can be successfully implemented in companies of  any size and provide some concept suggestions on how SMEs  could establish the method .  The Lean Startup Approach fulfils necessary criteria such  as customer feedback which should be integrated i n any modern innovation process as a essential part of it . If a flexible  and iterative approach is supported, these necessary criteria can  be obtained and additionally the full potential of the existing customer base can be exploited. 5.Conclusions and next steps Due to various global challenges, companies are forced to  keep up with rapid market changes and reliably
various global challenges, companies are forced to  keep up with rapid market changes and reliably establish a  product or service on the market that is both wanted and needed  by customers. As dynamics increases, the reliability of success forecasts decreases, and many product design innovations fail. An innovation that has failed on the market can threaten the  existence of companies in particular SMEs, since they can  usually spend only limited resources –in financial, human and  material terms –on the development of n ew products . In order to strengthen the innovation potential of SMEs , this  research work considers theLean Startup Approach , which  intends to accelerate the agile innovation process and produce  a safe product through fine -meshed customer feedback , as a  promising chance .  To verify the hypotheses, that the Lean Startup Approach can be migrated to manufacturing SMEs and influence their innovat ion potential positively, the authors collect edinformation about procedures , beliefs and opinions from 15 experts, who applied this approach in large manufacturing  companies worldwide. The following is a summary of the most  important outcomes that occurred during the establishment of  the Lean Startup Approach in large companies:  In many cases the product development process was shortened by months and a sustainable connection between customer and company was established. The  product was more l ikely to be accepted on the market  and the development costs went down. Atime-intensive and profound customer contact , had to  be maintained ,what absorbed great capacities and  which is considered as potential challenge in smaller  companies.  Involving th e customer in the development process,  helped immensely to save time, work and costs.  Many experts believe , that the Lean Startup Approach can work well for SMEs despite the smaller resources  than for large companies . The smaller size can even be  an advantage due to less bureaucratic
than for large companies . The smaller size can even be  an advantage due to less bureaucratic hassle and shorter communication channels. t The Lean Startup Approach can be applied to  companies of all size and in any sector. After this theoretical customization, t he research team is  now moving to phase 3 which will consist of the elaboration of  a conception to migrate the lean -startup- approach to a SME.  This concept ion will form a guideline for a pilot phase  consisting of implementation of the conception in a sele cted  middle- size company . A subsequent evaluation of the out - come will provide the conclusion of the large scale study on the  impact of Lean Startup Approach to increase innovation in  SMEs Questions to be answered is, if theLean Startup Approach is releva nt for the process of increasing innovation potential and simultaneously cutting the duration of the innovation  process? And to which extend can it be considered? In the last phase a validation, refinement, and final conclusions as well as a publication are planned.

[1]Sadly , it is becoming increasingly common  for manufacturing companies to find that, despite well- founded  market research at the beginning of the process, the customer does not want orneed the new product , because until the  product is on the market, the market needs have change . [2] To reduce th eriskof failing customer needs, agile processes  and iterative product design areof enormous im portance . It is  crucial to constantly check whether the products meet the  demand of the market and to design the product in a variable way, so that changes can be taken up immediately and learning  effects can be implemented. Therefore, c ompanies are forced to use new methods of innovation that allow faster and more  customer oriented product development . One such method is the Lean Startup Approach . This  method is based on a constant customer feedback, iterative  testing of prototypes and continuo us improvement through  learning. Originally, it was e stablished as a way of product  development for startups, which need a very fast and effective  way of product development and are therefore forced to  optimise their initial market approach through iterati ve testing  of prototypes and continuous improvement through learningfrom customer feedback .

E -mail address: isabella.jesemann@iao.fraunhofer.de Abstract The agile product innovation method Lean Startup Approach is used by startups to quickly adapt to the fast changing market conditions and  customer needs. The authors carried out a preliminary study which show edthat global challenges such as digital transformation are urging  companies to become more dynamic and flexible, and that this method is already used by large co mpanies to meet the needs .  Based on the preliminary study, the authors conducted in -depth interviews with experts to examine the procedure for introducing the Lean  Startup Approach in large manufacturing companies, and examined the feasibility of applying the method to SMEs. .

712 Isabella Jesemann  et al. / Procedia CIRP 99 (2021) 711 –716 that the Lean Startup Approach can also be successfully applied  to larger manufacturing companies.  To support this assumption, three global companies (Daimler AG (Germany), General Electrics (USA) and Alibaba  (China)) , which have already integrated the Lean Startup  Approach into their existing product innovation processes,  were examined and challenges and opportunities were  identified. The investigation show edthat all three comp anies  achieved great success using this approach as it enables them  to react more flexible to external influences, such as market competition, new technologie s or economical shifts , due to a  fast and direct reaction to the experiences based on customer  dialogue. 2.Approach and research methodology: overview  2.1.Hypothesis and procedure Upon confirmation that the Lean Startup Approach works  both in startups and in large companies the authors established  the hypothesis that this innovation method can deliver an  important contribution to the product development process in  SMEs and thus influence their innovation potential positively.  If this transferability is possible, the Lean Startup Approach could be an innovation method applicable to companies of a ny  size. The authors state that manufacturing companies us ingthe  Lean Startup Approach will be able to react flexibly to market  situations, as well as to innovate their production process, which can lead to a faster production process. In order to find o ut how the Lean Startup Approach can help  manufacturing companies become more agile, flexible and faster, and for the sake of gaining the best possible insight of  the topic the authors defined a methodology of investigation in  four main phases: Phase I: Preliminary study aiming at definition of the  research goal and determination of the research method,  furthermore a literature research regarding state of the art  of the research topic and
method,  furthermore a literature research regarding state of the art  of the research topic and identification of challenges, chances and possible benefits. Phase II:Expert interviews to examine in detail the  procedure for introducing the Lean Startup Approach in  their company. Description of the Lean Startup Approachin its qualities and possible applications. Transfer of the  research results of the preliminary st udy and the findings  from the expert interviews to the needs and circumstances of SMEs.  Phase III: Conception of a method for customization of the  Lean Startup Approach to SMEs. Pilot- implementation of  the concept with a selected medium -sized company and  evaluation.   Phase IV: Final works: Validation, refinement and final  conclusion. Publication.In the following the authors present the results of the second  phase of the study consisting of a performed empirical study  with field investigation aiming at validating the above stated hypothesis and delivering a concept for the migration of the Lean Startup Approach to SMEs.2.2. Approach and methodology  The authors chose qualitative expert interviews as primary  data gathering method to collect information regarding experiences , convictions and opinions from experts, who have  applied th eLean Startup Approach in large manufacturing  companies. This method is particularly suitable for gathering  background information and tapping into an expert's  knowledge of a particular subject. In accordance with Adams [4] interviews can generally be  placed on a continuum of structure, from “unstructured” to highly “structured.”, which represents the amount of “control”  the interviewer will have over the interaction. [4]Following the  method also described by Harell et all [3]Adams [4]and Ahlin  [5] t he research group used semi -standardized interviews to  identify specific qualitative characteristics of responde nts on  the same topics and to find out about the different individual  experiences with
responde nts on  the same topics and to find out about the different individual  experiences with the implementation of the Lean Startup Approach . Conducted in form of a conversation with one  respondent at a time, this interview method employs a blend of closed- and open -ended questions, often accompanied by  follow- up “why”or “how”questions. Theinterviewers used an interview guide with topics and questions that had to be  covered, and which had been asked of all respondents. Even  though the dialogue could meander around the topics on th e  agenda and delve into totally unforeseen issues , the main  questions were always asked and answered. In order to qualify as an experts the interview partner had to  meet three criteria: They had to be employees of a large c ompany , They had to beoccupie d in a leading position with the  topic "innovation” . And  The company had to use L ean Startup Approach at least  as one of the component sin the irinnovation method  portfolio. For the evaluation, the experts were anonymized . Figure 1 shows a list of all interviewed participants with their assigned  identification number, gender, position and time in the organization.

In this way, it was  possible to ask questions that matched the direction in which  the conversation with the respective expert had developed. 3.2.Output expert interviews In the following, the content of the expert interviews will be  examined focusing on the importance of the customer in the  innovation process. For this reason, the authors carried out a qualitative analysis, that highlights individual posit ions and  examine the corresponding citations. 3.2.1. Motivation for the introduction of the Lean Startup  Approach One of the reasons why companies gave consideration to  the Lean Startup Approach was that the methods of product development used until then have b ecome disappointing and  frustrating . Expert 3 commented on this : “We […] do have engineers who put in so much detailed work  and then develop a really great product and then notice that […]  nobody needs it.” (E3) Thus, the goal was to find a faster and more reliable way to  test as many ideas as possible. Companies needed an approach  who toimplement ideas at high speed and in high quantity ,  expert 3 pointed out . “We needed an approach that would allow us to test very  quickly, very many [...] ideas.” ( E3) Expert 15 explain edthat the traditional innovation methods,  like the waterfall -method or the V -method, had become too  slow and too rigid for the companies. Therefore, a change in innovation methods had to be made and the Lean Startup Approac h was considered. “[With] waterfall and [...] project management oriented  models, [you] realized that it all takes a very long time if you  stick with these models. ”(E15) Expert 1 brought out a third argument besides reliability and  speed: the costs. He stated that a gile innovation methods,  especially the Lean Startup Approach , hadbeen introduced in  his company to test ideas faster and cheaper. These properties gave agile innovation methods a clear advantage over
Isabella Jesemann  et al. / Procedia CIRP 99 (2021) 711 –716 713 These criteria were important to determine the benefit of the  Lean Startup Approach in large companies, in order to  determine a possible transferability of the Lean Startup  Approach to SMEs.  The experts came from a wide range of industrial sectors. It  was important to cho ose experts from a wide range of industrial  sectors in order to find out if the method is applicable to all sectors.  In the following a ll subsequent expert statements are  provided with the corresponding identification number and can thus b e assigned directly . 3.Research output: p hase II 3.1.Study overview Over a period of two months, 15 expert interviews were  conducted with various companies worldwide. The expert  interviews were conducted by telephone in an open exchange. The time frame of the interviews varied between 20 and 60 minutes. The interviews were recorded and subseq uently  transcribed. An analysis of the interviews was then prepared on the base of the transcripts. Commonalities in content were identified and the respective statements of the interviewees were compared with each other. Existing structures were uncovered and evaluated. The semi -standardized expert  interviews were afterwards evaluated with the focus on  customer interaction in the Lean Startup Approach Since the expert interviews were conducted in an open  exchange and many different topics were discussed, the object area was limited to five main topics within the scope of this study. These main topics were :  Motivation for the introduction of the Lean S tartup  Approach. Presentation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Involvement of the customer in the product development process. Customer interaction. Applicability of the Lean Startup Approach to SMEs . In addition to the five main question groups , over 60 supplementary questions were formulated and divided into the  various sub -themes of the research topic. In this way, it was
ideas faster and cheaper. These properties gave agile innovation methods a clear advantage over traditional innovation methods: “What wa s hoped for from more agile and lean methods in the  field of innovation was that through exploratory approaches,  [...] one could easily [innovate] very, very quickly and above  all very, very cheaply. [...]” ( E1) Speed pays off for companies in various way s. Since the  Lean Startup Approach makes it possible to test a lot of ideas very quickly and very cheaply, companies were able to take advantage of this and place products on the market earlier than their competitors , claimed expert 5. “Just because it is rapidly, it provides us an opportunity to go  and get things in front of the customer or partner or somebody  very quickly.” ( E5) Expert 10ultimately confirmed that the Lean Startup  Approach has accelerated the innovative product development  process in his company by weeks, often months: “When we started the new process, development was shortened  by months.” ( E10) The authors see all this statements as confirmation that the  Lean Startup Approach is of great importance for the innovation process of large companies in terms of reliability,  speed and costs.

714 Isabella Jesemann  et al. / Procedia CIRP 99 (2021) 711 –716 3.2.2. Presentation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) The MVP is a first unfinished product design, sometimes in  a partly primitive stage of development. In the process of the  Lean Startup Approach the idea of presentation of a product in  a very early stage is of great importance. At the time of  presentation to customers, the MVP might still be just a ro ugh  visualisation . In the course of the interviews many experts  stated, that the companies were highly concerned regarding presentation of a product in such an early state. Asemployees  are usually trained to give the customer the best possible  impression about their product and to cover up potential defects, so it proved difficult to present unfinished and not yet  perfect products.  Existing brands and a reputation built up over the years  often make it difficult to use a method in which a product is presented to the customer that, due to its type of prototype, does not come close to the classic standards of the company. Experts  9 and 11 claim ed, that the concern to damage the reputation of  a brand already built up was the main issue for the employees. . Theyfearedthat customers could misinterprete the MVP for  a real product , which could ultimately have a n egative impact  on the company's image.  “It is always a topic that companies are afraid of approaching  customers […] with half -finished products, because […] a  corporate has a completely different brand risk than a startup. ”  (E11) “There is a lot of issue behind our brands and you do not risk  brands that have taken in some cases a hundred years to  develop.” (E 9) However, experts 4 and 3 stated, that through open and  honest communication in which they explain edthat the product  actually is in an early stage as the goal of the method is learning  from customer feedback as well as iterating and improving the product based on that feedback, the understanding of the customers
as iterating and improving the product based on that feedback, the understanding of the customers grew considerably.  “When you go to the customer and say we want to listen to you  first, we want to learn from you […] the door is wide open and  it is always incredible how much the customers talk. ” (E3) “They are already prepared […] for the fact that it is not really  about the finished product, but that it is more about learning  from the customers. ” (E2) Therefore, to the authors it seems advisable to be well  prepared for the presentation of the MVP and undergo special  training before doing so as well as preparing the customer. If concerns of damaging the brand are still severe, expert 9  suggest edto carry out the presentation of the MVP  anonymously, so that no damage to the company would be done. “They will not necessarily know if it is a [corporate name]  product they are [testing] or not.” (9)3.2.3. Involvement of customers in the product development  process. Expert 6 observed that t he ever -recurring emphasis on the  practical aspect of the Lean Startup Approach was very close  to the experts' hearts . Since customer contact is very important  in the Lean Startup Approach, to get the necessary opinions  from customers and to react to them, employees need  experience in dealing with customers which they only can gain  in practice : „Lean startup has a lot to do with experience, becaus e you get  out of the comfort zone pretty quickly. As opposed to sitting  behind the computer and building slides forever, you have to  get out and get feedback at some point. So it's an experience.“  (E6) Statements by experts 11 or 15 show that t he involvem ent  of the customer may contribute to strengthen the relation between company and customer.  “The customers react great, of course. […] Especially because  people like to share their opinion.” (E11) “[Customers] usually [react] positively, so most of them find  this very pleasant, because […] we have […] topics
[react] positively, so most of them find  this very pleasant, because […] we have […] topics that are  very new […] and in this way they were involved very early  on.” (E15) Most experts suggested that customers reacted positively on  being involved into product development, were happy to  contribute and felthono ured for being consulted.  An open communication with the customer creates  understanding and solidarity which only can be beneficial in the future.  Nevertheless, some experts ( like expert 7) also experience  negative customer reactions .  “We also have had very different experiences with customers.  We had a workshop where the customers also said, "Say, what  am I actually doing here when I develop my product together  with you?” (E7) According to expert 2, it is also much easier if the c ustomer  already knows the method and uses it himself. “The fear [...] is not there to test a minimal viable product on a  customer, because […] our customers also start […] lean  startup […] so [it] is much easier for them to understand. ” (E10) Well- trained and prepared employees seem to be especially  important to approach customers differently and clarify their  role in the process, without raising false or too high  expectations. Therefore , the authors suggest that a part of the  preparation for the customer presentations should be dedicated  to training for such situation s.

Isabella Jesemann  et al. / Procedia CIRP 99 (2021) 711 –716 715 3.2.4. Customer interaction Many experts emphasized that the customer interaction was  extremely important. According to the experts , companies  should find the courage to send their employe es out and let  them interact with customers as often as possible . To guarantee  the customer contact, some companies have defined how many  customers the respective teams have to talk to. This was up to  100 customers in eight weeks, as reported by expert 3. “The teams must conduct at least 100 customer interviews in  [...] eight weeks.” (E3) Such statements make it obvious how time consuming a  procedure that is which requires appropriate resources . The  employees and teams need sufficient working time to main tain  this customer contact. Expert E13 suggested theemployees  being freed from their daily routine tasks, allowing them to  focus on the new task connected with the Lean Startup  Approach relevant customer interaction .  “But in order to have this […] team […] you need to be able to  release them from their daily job to allocate time on applying  the lean startup and discussing with customers […].“ (E13) The experts have come to this conclusion through their  innovation work , as customer contact proved too valuable. If  companies do not maintain close customer contact, this can  lead to the failure of an idea .Expert 15 stressed that if an  apparently innovative idea does not manage to enter into a  customer dialogue, the idea wil l usually not evolve .  “So the ideas that went really badly, even if the ideas were  good, [...] were those due to a lack of customer focus. [If] the  idea does not manage to talk to a customer in [...] 6 months [...],  be it an internal customer or an external customer, then it won't  be successful in general.” (E15) Companies must therefore be prepared to provide  employees with sufficient working time for customer contac t. All the same expert 12 warned against
employees with sufficient working time for customer contac t. All the same expert 12 warned against overstretching the  Lean Startup Approach . The company must be careful not to  flood the customer with too much information and only assign him doable and meaningful tasks. Therefore ,companies should  be careful not to overburden the individual customer and make everyone feel part of the development pro cess: „You don't do [ lean startup] too inflationary and too spam, it is  [a great] form of customer retention, if you give them the  feeling of being cocreative. […]“ ( E12) 3.2.5. Applicability of the Lean Startup Approach to SMEs. The experts confirmed that Lean Startup Approach intended  for startups worked well also in large companies. Thus it was  of great interest to the authors whether the experts believed in  the success of theLean Startup Approach being transferred to  SMEs. As SMEs have fewer human and financ ial resources than large companies the question arose if that could be an  obstacle .  The experts did not see a disadvantage regarding the size of  a company while implementing the Lean Startupo Approach .  Some experts like expert 10 and expert 14 believed that the  SMEs could benefit from the smaller size, in terms of shorter  way of communication and less distinctive bureaucratic  processes . “I think [the Lean Startup Approach] would work much better  for SMEs than for a large corporation [...].” ( E10) “Lean startup fits SMEs incredibly well and even better than  large companies.“ ( E14) Expert 10 was confident that the transferability of the Lean  Startup Approach to SMEs would not only succeed, but would  work even better for S MEs than for large companies becaus e  in his opinion strict administrative processes make it difficult  for large companies to use an innovation method such as Lean  Startup Approach effectively. “A corporation is already very, very complex and the decision - making processes can be very complicated. And the most
very, very complex and the decision - making processes can be very complicated. And the most  important thing about lean startup [...] is that the people who  have to work on the project have the authority to make  decisions, not wait for [a decision from] the 120th floor.” ( E10) Accodring to expert 11 s ome of the companies have already  started Lean Startup Approaches with SMEs of different sizes,  and the practical results were positive: “We have several SMEs with us. Starting with one SME with  100 people, up to 1000 people. And it works, it works great!”  (E11) From this, the authors interpret that the application of the  Lean Startup Approach is possible for SMEs. 4.Study results In conclusion ,theLean Startup Approach offers many  possibilities to companies. In that ,it contains some answers to  the urgent issues of the time, not only to large companies or  startups but also to SMEs. For one the Lean Startup Approach does accelerate product development, while it makes  innovation processes cheaper , more flexible and more reliable .  Through testing and validating the product in a very early  stage of development, products that will not work on the market can be spotted much earlier than with traditional innovation methods and excluded from further development. Because of  that, the risk of developing costly and time -consuming products  can be reduced, making the L ean Startup Approach a safer  innovation method than most previous ly used methods.  Another positive aspect is the possibility to apply theLean  Startup Approach in any industry. While many companies and  startups use the Lean Startup Approach for s oftware development , our investigation of experts from many different  industries suggests that it can be successfully used in traditional  This is a resupply of March 2023 as the template used in the publication of the original article contained errors.

716 Isabella Jesemann  et al. / Procedia CIRP 99 (2021) 711 –716 production, too. However, in order to implement Lean Startup  Approach companies need to be ready to change their corporate  philosophy as well as their structures to allow for more  flexibility.  Because customer involvement is crucial for applying the  Lean Startup Approach ,there is great need for traini ng  employees regarding engaging, communicating and interacting  with the c ustomers. The authors have also learned , that a solid  preparation for the presentation of an MVP to the customer is  crucial for succe eding. A well -informed customer can make the  difference between getting much needed customer feedback or  failing to do so.  The interviews have shown , that beside the obvious benefits  of getting customer feedback, successfully conducted customer involvement can also lead to a rise in sympathy towards the company and improve customer relations. A large preexisting  customer isadvantageous but is not crucial for applying the  Lean ean Startup Approach, as during the process, new  customers can be gained . As a result, a time -intensive and  profound customer contact must be established , continuously cultivated and maintained . This absorbs capabilities what may  be a challenge especially for smaller companies. Nevertheless, the experts agree d that the L ean Startup  Approach can be successfully implemented in companies of  any size and provide some concept suggestions on how SMEs  could establish the method .  The Lean Startup Approach fulfils necessary criteria such  as customer feedback which should be integrated i n any modern innovation process as a essential part of it . If a flexible  and iterative approach is supported, these necessary criteria can  be obtained and additionally the full potential of the existing customer base can be exploited. 5.Conclusions and next steps Due to various global challenges, companies are forced to  keep up with rapid market changes and reliably
various global challenges, companies are forced to  keep up with rapid market changes and reliably establish a  product or service on the market that is both wanted and needed  by customers. As dynamics increases, the reliability of success forecasts decreases, and many product design innovations fail. An innovation that has failed on the market can threaten the  existence of companies in particular SMEs, since they can  usually spend only limited resources –in financial, human and  material terms –on the development of n ew products . In order to strengthen the innovation potential of SMEs , this  research work considers theLean Startup Approach , which  intends to accelerate the agile innovation process and produce  a safe product through fine -meshed customer feedback , as a  promising chance .  To verify the hypotheses, that the Lean Startup Approach can be migrated to manufacturing SMEs and influence their innovat ion potential positively, the authors collect edinformation about procedures , beliefs and opinions from 15 experts, who applied this approach in large manufacturing  companies worldwide. The following is a summary of the most  important outcomes that occurred during the establishment of  the Lean Startup Approach in large companies:  In many cases the product development process was shortened by months and a sustainable connection between customer and company was established. The  product was more l ikely to be accepted on the market  and the development costs went down. Atime-intensive and profound customer contact , had to  be maintained ,what absorbed great capacities and  which is considered as potential challenge in smaller  companies.  Involving th e customer in the development process,  helped immensely to save time, work and costs.  Many experts believe , that the Lean Startup Approach can work well for SMEs despite the smaller resources  than for large companies . The smaller size can even be  an advantage due to less bureaucratic
than for large companies . The smaller size can even be  an advantage due to less bureaucratic hassle and shorter communication channels. t The Lean Startup Approach can be applied to  companies of all size and in any sector. After this theoretical customization, t he research team is  now moving to phase 3 which will consist of the elaboration of  a conception to migrate the lean -startup- approach to a SME.  This concept ion will form a guideline for a pilot phase  consisting of implementation of the conception in a sele cted  middle- size company . A subsequent evaluation of the out - come will provide the conclusion of the large scale study on the  impact of Lean Startup Approach to increase innovation in  SMEs Questions to be answered is, if theLean Startup Approach is releva nt for the process of increasing innovation potential and simultaneously cutting the duration of the innovation  process? And to which extend can it be considered? In the last phase a validation, refinement, and final conclusions as well as a publication are planned.

El artículo de acceso abierto publicado por Elsevier B.V. en la revista Procedia CIRP aborda el tema de la innovación, la puesta en marcha ágil y la producción orientada al cliente en las pequeñas y medianas empresas (PYMEs) en un contexto de cambios globales y desafíos sin precedentes. Se destaca que la competencia global, los cambios rápidos en el mercado y la necesidad de innovaciones más rápidas y efectivas están creando una nueva situación de riesgo para las empresas, especialmente las PYMEs. Se menciona que los métodos tradicionales de innovación son complicados, costosos y poco flexibles, lo que lleva a muchas empresas a enfrentar situaciones de bancarrota debido a la falta de adaptación a los cambios del mercado y la incapacidad de gestionar la innovación de manera efectiva.

El artículo destaca la importancia de adoptar enfoques más ágiles y centrados en el cliente para la innovación, como el enfoque Lean Startup, que se basa en la retroalimentación constante del cliente, pruebas iterativas de prototipos y mejora continua a través del aprendizaje. Se menciona que este enfoque ha sido implementado con éxito en grandes empresas manufactureras como Daimler AG, General Electrics y Alibaba, lo que ha permitido a estas empresas adaptarse rápidamente a los cambios del mercado y mejorar su proceso de innovación de productos.

Se discute la presentación de un Producto Mínimo Viable (MVP) en el marco del Enfoque Lean Startup, destacando la importancia de presentar el producto en una etapa temprana para obtener retroalimentación del cliente y mejorar el producto de manera iterativa. Se menciona que la interacción con el cliente es fundamental en este enfoque, y se resalta la importancia de capacitar a los empleados en la interacción con los clientes para obtener retroalimentación necesaria y reaccionar a ella de manera efectiva.

Se discute la aplicabilidad del enfoque Lean Startup en empresas de todos los tamaños y sectores, destacando que las empresas más pequeñas pueden beneficiarse de su menor tamaño al tener menos burocracia y canales de comunicación más cortos. Se plantea la posibilidad de migrar este enfoque a las PYMEs para aumentar su potencial de innovación y reducir la duración del proceso de innovación. Se menciona que el estudio se encuentra en la fase de elaboración de un concepto para migrar el enfoque Lean Startup a una PYME, con el objetivo de evaluar su impacto en el aumento de la innovación en este tipo de empresas. Se destaca la importancia de mantener un contacto continuo con los clientes para el éxito de una idea innovadora, y se enfatiza la necesidad de cambiar la filosofía corporativa y las estructuras para permitir más flexibilidad en el proceso de innovación.
