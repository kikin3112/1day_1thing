total quality management   I. INTRODUCTION   Digital Transformation (DT) has recently increasingly  driven organizations to change [1] . It has become one of the  most discussed debates in business and organizational  contexts  [2]. The DT  has involved sustainable management in  coping  with these changes ; this is a vital and essential process  for organizations that  pretend to be leaders of change and be  competitive in their sector  [3], [4].   COVID -19 pandemic has mobilized research community  for developing early diagnosis systems  [5]–[11]. In addition,  this pandemic has confirmed the need to digitalize public and private org anizations (companies and educational institutions,  etc.). The pandemic was an opportunity to innovate and  accelerate the digital transformation to ensure the continuity  and sustainability of the company [12] .  In the education sector , the digital transformation has  implicated  sustainable management in dealing with these  transformation s [13]–[15]. The DT has b een significant  as a  primary focus for higher  education institutions (HEIs) [16] .  Many studies have introduced the digital transformation in  public administrations and the public sector [17], [18] , that are focusing on redefining their processes to create new forms of  public administration and interaction s with users of their  services.   In the current research, we will  focus on the Moroccan  research structures, taking as a case study our scientific research laboratory L aROSERI, which unfortunately requires  additional efforts to ensure good productivity and sustainability. Through digital transformation, it will be able  to manage efficiently and effectively  the whole research  laboratory from  different axes: performance, knowledge  management , and b usiness process re -engineering.   In our previous work [19] , we considered the research  laboratory as a non -profit organization, and then we defined  an indicator called “Global Laboratory Performance
a non -profit organization, and then we defined  an indicator called “Global Laboratory Performance Indicator  GLPI” to measure the laboratory's global performance. As a  result, it has been shown a suita ble approach should be  adopted.   For this purpose, we suggest the following rankings, which  show the necessity to rethink our managerial and strategic organization.  To define the gaps that lead us to this study, we  refer to the Ranking Web of World Research Centers as an  initiative of the Cybermetrics Lab, a research group belonging  to the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas  (CSIC) 1. CSIC is one of the leading essential research  organizations in Europe. In 2006, CSIC comprised  126 centers  and institutes throughout Spain. CSIC is  attached to the  Ministry of Education, and its primary goal is to promote scientific research to enhance  scientific and technological  progress .  The following Table I ranks the top ten research  centers/labs, according to the 2019 CSIC ranking.   The Table II  describes the global and African ranking of  Moroccan research centers. As presented, the Moroccan Institute of Scientific and Technical Information -  IMIST is  ranked 65 th in Africa and 4094th worldwide .  These rankings highlight the importance  and the need for a  set of actions to reposition the scientific research structures that are facing strategical and managerial challenges.   Furthermore, Morocco upholds digital transformation through many initiatives to accelerate its development; we can ci te  some of them as described in the Table III.                                                               1 https://research.webometrics.info/en/

MOROCCAN INITIATIVES   Moroccan  Initiative  Description   “Horizon  2020”  In Morocco, the digital transformation has been accelerated,  mainly due to the major government initiatives, "Horizon 2020", launched in 2017, and then "Horizon 2025", which  have set ambitious goals in terms  of e-government and  training of young people in innovative technologies.   The National  Plan to reform  administration (2018 -2021)  It is considered a crucial demand to upgrade  the  administration and the public Service through its restructuring and the reinforcement of its managerial and  technical capacities to be qualified to offer good  governance, ensure services of the general interest , and  provide users with quality services .

Law 51 -17 The Moroccan parliament approved the framework law 51 - 17 in August 2019, which concerns the government's  strategic plan "2015 -2030" to strengthen the national  education system. The framework law 51 -17 will mandate  the creation of  a national commission to supervise its  execution and the overall education system reform in  Morocco.   To properly define the factors that led us to this study, we  propose a SWOT analysis as described in Table IV.  As shown in the SWOT analysis, it describe s what the  research laboratory excels, identifies in which it needs to  undertake improvement s to remain competitive . In addition,  the analysis mentions factors that have the potential to harm   the research laboratory or that could provide a strategic  advant age to it. TABLE IV.

(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,   Vol. 13, No. 9, 2022  377 | Page   www.ijacsa.thesai.org  According to the points above, we have decided that  adopting a digital transformation could solve this issue, thus  digitizing, managing, and eventually repositioning the  research laboratory within the university.   This work emphasizes using a knowledge management  system (KMS) capable of filling all the gaps me ntioned.   To successfully conduct this resear ch, we focused on the  following three research questions:   • How can the laboratory develop the digital  transformation strategy?   • How clear does the management in the Lab understand  the needs for a digital transformation of its organization?   • How does the labor atory apply digital technologies and  managerial practices in its processes?   To answer the research questions, t he main contributions  of this work are the following:   • Defining the factors and limits that have forced us to  adopt a digital transfor mation using  the SWOT  analysis.   • Using a Knowledge Management System that  combines all the TQM aspects  to manage the whole  structure.   • Standardize all the research structure processes to be  expressed explicitly.   The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section I I  presents the related works and the problematic. Section III describes the proposed approach. Section IV shows the  implementation using KMS -TQM digital platform and Bizagi  Modeler. Finally, section V concludes the current work and proposes the perspective s.  II. R ELATED WORKS   Due to new needs and requirements, several sectors have  used digitalization to obtain a competitive advantage and ensure continuity [20], [21]. To discuss the state of the art, we  propose the following subsections that determine each aspect  of our work: Digitalization and Digital transformation, Knowled ge Management, Business process Re -engineering,  and their applications in the context of
Knowled ge Management, Business process Re -engineering,  and their applications in the context of HEIs.   A. Digitalization and Digital Transformation   According to [12] , the COVID- 19 pandemic has confirmed  the need and importance of digitalization  in public and private  organizations. It was an opportunity to innovate and accelerate  the digital transformation to ensure the continuity and  sustainability of organizations. To define the term 'Digitalization' and ‘Digital Transformation’, the following  Table V illustrates some definitions proposed in the literat ure.  As pointed out in [25] , digital competence is considered as  a set of skills, knowledge , and attitudes necessar y to use ICT  and digital devic es for responsibilities such as information  management, and collaboration in an effective, efficient and  ethical way. Digital transformation is considered a well-known topic at the moment, and ideas for digital products,  facilities,  and media were already widely understood in the  1990s and 2000s [26] .  TABLE V.  DIGITALIZATION AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION  DEFINITIONS   Ref Definition   [22] Digitalization is a " sustainable company -level transformation via  revised or newly created business operations and business models  achieved through value -added digitalization initiatives, ultimately  resulting in improved profitability ."  [23] The digitaliz ation is " the application of any digital technologies to all  human activities, such as personal life, social, economic and political  activities ."  [24] Digital transformation is “ a proc ess that aims to improve an entity by  triggering significant changes to its properties through combinations  of information, computing, communication, and connectivity  technologies .”  “Each organizational transformation implies a cultural  transformation”, the introduction of new technologies and  digitalization has strongly contributed to the organizational and cultural transformation of companies [27] .
has strongly contributed to the organizational and cultural transformation of companies [27] . Digital  transformation has caused a significant change in the business,  both in its activities, its organization and even in its culture  [28]. Digital transformation is the integration of new processes  within the company, such as adopting new technologies, tools,  and work methods [29]. It impacts the global functioning of  companies and transfo rms working methods and processes,  requiring managerial approaches for a long -term vision to  remain competitive, efficient, and modern [30] .  B. Total Quality Management   Total quality management is a managerial approach that  began  in Japanese industry and has received increased  attention in the West since the early 1980s [31], [32].  Total  quality refer s to a company’s  culture, attitude, and  organization that attempts to consistently offer  its customers  products and services that fulfil l their expectations [33] .  TQM is a quality management approach whose target  is to  achieve ideal quality, the entire company s hould be mobilized  and involved, by reducing waste as much as poss ible and by  continuously improving the output elements  [28]. Many agree  that the TQM movement began in Japan, the term TQM  comes from TQC, it was coined by A.V. Freignbaum, 1983   [34], [35] . Organizations that have successfully used the  principles of TQM, have integrated the customer and quality  into their business strategy  [36]. It is the result of the efforts  made to develop Qualit y Management.   Important aspects of TQM  encompass  quality management  leadership and commitment, continuous improvement, rapid response, evidence -based actions, employee involvement, and  a TQM culture [37].  In the context  of higher education, s everal quality  management models developed for use in industry have been  involved in HEIs around the world  [43], such as TQM,  EFQM, Balanced scorecard, Malcolm Baldridge award, ISO  9000,
around the world  [43], such as TQM,  EFQM, Balanced scorecard, Malcolm Baldridge award, ISO  9000, Business process re -engineering and SERVQUAL.  One  of the most well- known quality management models that have
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,   Vol. 13, No. 9, 2022  378 | Page   www.ijacsa.thesai.org  been implemented in higher education is T otal Quality  Management (TQM) as described in Table VI [44] .  The study [45]  define s the seven TQM factors as follows:   Leadership , Strategic planning , Human resource management ,  Customer orientation , Process management , Information  analysis , and Continuous process improvement . Through  the implication of TQM concepts , assists organizations  in  learning strategies to increase productivity.  The dimensions of  TQM indicate the broad ra nge of features  in organizational  cultures that promote  innovation. Yet, the success of TQM  demands  an organizational culture based on trust and  knowledge sharing [46].  TABLE VI.  TQM  APPLICATIONS IN HEI S  Ref Year  Overview   [38] 2018 Through a review of the literature, this research aims to  examine the impact of TQM on the organizational  performance of Portuguese universities and polytechnic  higher education institutions. The purpose of this study is to  point out the importance of quality in education, specif ically  in HEIs, as indicated by the recent studies, the existing  literature has highlighted the fact that educational institutions  are lagging behind other organizations in terms of total  quality culture.   [39] 2019 This research represents a survey done at two Swedish  universities, and it attempts to determine teacher educators'  use of digitalization technologies and the resulting demand  for digital competence in highe r education. Digital  competence involves, among other factors, acquiring and  familiarizing with various digital tools and apps to utilize  Internet and digital technology is a critical and educative  approach.   [40] 2019 The digital transformation strategy seeks to create the capacity to fully use the potential of new technolog ies in a  fast and innovative manner in the future. The study proves
the potential of new technolog ies in a  fast and innovative manner in the future. The study proves that planning and implementing infrastructure allow all  students and staff to effectively communicate, share  information, and collaborate in research skills, thus  improving teaching and le arning and supporting  administrative functions, students, and staff to use computer systems to boost their digital skills.   [41] 2020 This work represents a bibliometric of 1590 papers from the Scopus database. In the education sector, the Digital  transformation has necessitated the implementation of  a  long-term management strategy. The authors conclude that  HEIs are progressing in managing their economic, environmental, and social sustainability, concerning digital  transformation to reach the model of an open, digital,  innovative, and connected insti tution.   [42] 2022 Higher education institutions around the world have used  numerous quality management strategies. As mentioned in  this work, with the growing interest of the quality measures  for sustained growth in education, the potential of  developing a paradigm that reflects t he challenges of higher  education while including comprehensive quality and social responsibility ought to be considered. Therefore, the authors  proposed an approach that connects the TQM and social  responsibility of organizations and higher education  institutions.   Recently , knowledge management by the company has  constituted  a sustainable competitive advantage, forming a  common point with the objectives of the quality approach:  obtaining a competitive advantage [47]. Not only knowledge management, but the implementation of business process  management also help s organizations enhance their capacities  through individual knowledge resources and greater collective  knowledge of the organization.   The decision to manage the laboratory knowledge needs to  set a standardized process by redesigning the actual processes.   The
knowledge needs to  set a standardized process by redesigning the actual processes.   The following subsections define knowledge manage ment  and  business process re -engineering .  C. Knowledge Management   Knowledge is a valuable, scarce and non -substitutable  resource that enables an organization to gain a sustainable  competitive advantage [38]. It is a set  of experiences, values,  information and  ideas to assess and integrate new knowledge  and experiences . Knowledge is an intangible attribute that is  practically impossible to simulate and is considered a strategic  asset that has to be effectively managed by every organization   [48]. It can be explicit or tacit.   Knowledge management is the process of getting the right  knowledge to the right person at the right time. M oreover ,  knowledge management aims to  explicit the tacit knowledge   by systematizing large sets of know ledge and gathering  individual knowledge [49], [50] . The purpose is to produce  valuable knowledge, fulfill the knowledge demands of  customers, perform knowledge and innovations and strengthen  the basic competitiveness of an organization  [51]. The KM  approach is the integration of individuals, methods and technologies implied in planning and implementing the  infrastruc ture of the educational institution s [52].  Therefore, t he process of know ledge implies four  steps :  creation, retrieval/storage, transfer and application  [53]. The  different components  of KM as cited in these works  [53] in  Table VII include  five elements :  TABLE VII.  ELEMENTS  OF KM  Knowledge  Creation  The organization’s ability to create and communicate  knowledge in its services, and systems. The process of  knowledge creation consists in capturing a part of tacit  knowledge and transforming it into explicit knowledge.

is to  ensure that knowledge is productively applicable for the  organization's benefit, aiming to maximize performance.   Knowledge Sharing  Knowledge sharing is a range of behaviors that include  sharing information or helping others to inspire innovative behavior.   Knowledge Capitalization  (Storage)  It consists in identifying its crucial knowledge, preserving  it and making it sustainable while ensuring that it is shared  and used by the greatest nu mber of people. Without this  capitalization effort, collective knowledge does not exist.   Knowledge  Transfer It is the process of transferring knowledge between individuals, groups or organizations using various means or  channels of communication.

Busines s Process Re -engineering – BPR  Today, quality is identified by the process approach  of the   activities. The management of processes is a strategy adopted  by organi zations that want to become more efficient ; it would  make them more efficient in executing  their processes and  ultimately more competitiv e [54]. The term of ‘process  approach’ first appeared in its 2000 version:  "the application  of the proces s system  within an organization, as well as the  identification, interactions and management of these processes" . This definition summariz es the requirements of a  management system of quality , and treats the  customer  satisfaction by adding value to each process.   The process approach has been described and established  as the quality management basis in organizations throug h the  ISO 9001 version 2015 standard. It allows to identify, map the  processes, and understand their interactions in an organization  [55]. In addition, according to FD X50- 176 standard, “ Process  management can be applied to all types of organizations  regardless of their size, activity, and to the various  management systems implemented (quality, safety,  environment, etc.) ”[56].  E. Use case: Research Laboratory LAROSERI   1) Description : The LAROSERI research laboratory was  created in 2014. It belongs to the Computer Science  Department in the Faculty of Science in El Jadida, Morocco.  LAROSERI includes four  research teams as described in  Table VIII.   2) Challenges:  The main objective of this st udy is to  reposition the Chouaib Doukkali University in scientific research, by applying the Total Quality Management and using a Knowledge Management System .

that led us to  adopt a digital transformation . The Fig.  1 shows some  Laboratory challenges.   Aiming to address these issues, we propose an approach  based on Total Quality Management techniques that can  provide  adequate solutions to digitalize manage and steer  the  entire laboratory. The following section presents the proposed approach.   TABLE VIII.

Our case  study consists of proposing an innovative approach to properly  digitalize and manage the research laboratory.   The proposed approach can be divided in the workflow as  shown in Fig.  2. This digital transition impacts the overall  functioning of companies and disrupts working methods and processes, which requires the use of managerial approaches  for a long- term vision  to remain competitive, efficient , and  modern [57]–[59].  Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 describe the steps and tools that we used  to adopt a digital transformation in our research laboratory.   A. Knowledge Management using KMS -TQM Platform   The knowledge management concerns the way knowledge  is stocked and arranged . From a manager ial perspective, the  capitaliz ation of knowledge is a major  element in the  improvement of performance  via the establish ing of a  trustworthy resource base completed by appropriate software, and able to offer appropriate decision support.  The objective  of this function is to store relevant knowledge that assists  actors in their operations  [50].  In this work, w e
is to store relevant knowledge that assists  actors in their operations  [50].  In this work, w e propose to use a KMS (Knowledge  Management System) to capitalize and store knowledge in a repository, which is specifically designed for a scientific  research  laboratory , in order to provide relevant decision  support to the different  research laboratory’s actors .

Business Process Re -engineering using Bizagi  Modeler   Unfortunately,  for Quality module, the platform offers  only process mapping. Therefore, we  chose the Bizagi  Modeler tool for process modeling  in order  to make explicit  all the existing processes within the laboratory . The choice of  this robust process management tool aims to redesign the  research laboratory process, thus  integrating all actors,  functions, tasks, etc.   Bizagi4 is a free BPM tool  (for a single user) to create,  optimize and publish a  process. It also provides a cloud -based  collaboratio n environment, offering powerful and fast drag- and-drop design tools. In addition , it allows users to review  process models from any location and on any device and to   provide real -time feedback.                                                               2 http://37.187.48.129:9191/062021ic -canada- certified -trainings/  3 https://masoda.ch/   4 https://www.bizagi.com/en/products/bpm -suite/modeler  The KMS -TQM digital platform allows us the features   shown in Fig. 4.

Research Laboratory D igitalization and Management using KMS - TQM Digital Platform .  In this work, we intend to digitalize all the actual processes  and make them as a standard in our Laboratory.   IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   In this section, we will apply the proposed approach , first  by using KMS -TQM digital platform to digitalize and manage  knowled ge, then by using the Bizagi Modeler to manage the  laboratory processes.   The purpose of capitalizing knowledge in our case is to  make explicit functions, tasks, and competencies. It answers  the question: who did what and how ?  By using the KMS -TQM platform , we generate the  function sheets of each position in the research laboratory. We  have assigned to each position a function(s) that is linked to  numerous tasks and competencies.   The first step is to create the organizational entities and  assign each to a parent entity. For instance, in our case, a doctoral studies center depends on the doctoral college as  mentioned in Fig . 5.  The next step is to create competencies referential to tasks.  Then, assigning each task to an appropriate function becomes possible, a nd defining the function first manager and  assignments. Fig. 6 -8 below illustrate the entity's  management,  tasks, and function management.   After preparing functions with their owners, the platform  proposes to generate a functional or organizational sheet. It  summarizes all the functions depending on their relationship.

CONCLUSION   In summary, the TQM applications aiming to digitalize  and manage research structures are still very weak. This paper  analyzes the factors to adopt a digital transformation in the  research laboratory by applying the SWOT analysis and gives  an overview of some available recent studies that apply this  approach in the same context. The main objective of our  research is to integrate a Knowledge Manag ement System and  apply TQM aspects, which can apply to any research laboratory that desires to adopt a digital transformation. The  proposed approach briefly describes the steps to be followed  to digitalize and manage knowledge and redesign the current processes.   Despite the advantages of the research approach, some  limitations can be addressed through future research; the  platform used in the implementation does not link process  modeling with other modules, which means integration issues.  Therefore, to prop ose a suitable and adaptable solution, it will  be more practical to think of an open -source so lution with  huge possibilities.   In future work, as mentioned, we intend to conduct a  comparative study between laboratory management information systems (LIMS) by  selecting specific criteria to  propose an adequate digital framework. The framework will combine the quality management system (QMS) aspects and  integrate innovative solutions to digitalize and manage  research structures.

Moroccan universities, in their turn, are facing  strategic and managerial challenges due to emerging practices related to di gital transformation. To address this issue, the  proposed work sets out to define the factors that lead us to adopt  a digital transformation using SWOT  analysis and to apply total  quality management techniques to contribute to our research  laboratory's dig ital transformation, by digitalizing and managing  knowledge and processes. KMS -TQM digital platform has been  used to capitalize knowledge and profile the different existing  functions, positions, tasks, and referential competencies. Then, we analyzed all th e actual processes to propose a business process  re-engineering using Bizagi Modeler. The study’s contribution is  to standardize all the current processes in the laboratory to help  the Doctoral Studies Center successfully carry out the digital transformati on. Moreover, the aim is to make all functions and  tasks for each position explicit.   Keywords —Business process re -engineering ; digital  transformation ; knowledge management system ; Moroccan   research laboratory ; total quality management   I.

total quality management   I. INTRODUCTION   Digital Transformation (DT) has recently increasingly  driven organizations to change [1] . It has become one of the  most discussed debates in business and organizational  contexts  [2]. The DT  has involved sustainable management in  coping  with these changes ; this is a vital and essential process  for organizations that  pretend to be leaders of change and be  competitive in their sector  [3], [4].   COVID -19 pandemic has mobilized research community  for developing early diagnosis systems  [5]–[11]. In addition,  this pandemic has confirmed the need to digitalize public and private org anizations (companies and educational institutions,  etc.). The pandemic was an opportunity to innovate and  accelerate the digital transformation to ensure the continuity  and sustainability of the company [12] .  In the education sector , the digital transformation has  implicated  sustainable management in dealing with these  transformation s [13]–[15]. The DT has b een significant  as a  primary focus for higher  education institutions (HEIs) [16] .  Many studies have introduced the digital transformation in  public administrations and the public sector [17], [18] , that are focusing on redefining their processes to create new forms of  public administration and interaction s with users of their  services.   In the current research, we will  focus on the Moroccan  research structures, taking as a case study our scientific research laboratory L aROSERI, which unfortunately requires  additional efforts to ensure good productivity and sustainability. Through digital transformation, it will be able  to manage efficiently and effectively  the whole research  laboratory from  different axes: performance, knowledge  management , and b usiness process re -engineering.   In our previous work [19] , we considered the research  laboratory as a non -profit organization, and then we defined  an indicator called “Global Laboratory Performance
a non -profit organization, and then we defined  an indicator called “Global Laboratory Performance Indicator  GLPI” to measure the laboratory's global performance. As a  result, it has been shown a suita ble approach should be  adopted.   For this purpose, we suggest the following rankings, which  show the necessity to rethink our managerial and strategic organization.  To define the gaps that lead us to this study, we  refer to the Ranking Web of World Research Centers as an  initiative of the Cybermetrics Lab, a research group belonging  to the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas  (CSIC) 1. CSIC is one of the leading essential research  organizations in Europe. In 2006, CSIC comprised  126 centers  and institutes throughout Spain. CSIC is  attached to the  Ministry of Education, and its primary goal is to promote scientific research to enhance  scientific and technological  progress .  The following Table I ranks the top ten research  centers/labs, according to the 2019 CSIC ranking.   The Table II  describes the global and African ranking of  Moroccan research centers. As presented, the Moroccan Institute of Scientific and Technical Information -  IMIST is  ranked 65 th in Africa and 4094th worldwide .  These rankings highlight the importance  and the need for a  set of actions to reposition the scientific research structures that are facing strategical and managerial challenges.   Furthermore, Morocco upholds digital transformation through many initiatives to accelerate its development; we can ci te  some of them as described in the Table III.                                                               1 https://research.webometrics.info/en/ --- (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,   Vol. 13, No. 9, 2022  376 | Page   www.ijacsa.thesai.org  TABLE I.

MOROCCAN INITIATIVES   Moroccan  Initiative  Description   “Horizon  2020”  In Morocco, the digital transformation has been accelerated,  mainly due to the major government initiatives, "Horizon 2020", launched in 2017, and then "Horizon 2025", which  have set ambitious goals in terms  of e-government and  training of young people in innovative technologies.   The National  Plan to reform  administration (2018 -2021)  It is considered a crucial demand to upgrade  the  administration and the public Service through its restructuring and the reinforcement of its managerial and  technical capacities to be qualified to offer good  governance, ensure services of the general interest , and  provide users with quality services .

Law 51 -17 The Moroccan parliament approved the framework law 51 - 17 in August 2019, which concerns the government's  strategic plan "2015 -2030" to strengthen the national  education system. The framework law 51 -17 will mandate  the creation of  a national commission to supervise its  execution and the overall education system reform in  Morocco.   To properly define the factors that led us to this study, we  propose a SWOT analysis as described in Table IV.  As shown in the SWOT analysis, it describe s what the  research laboratory excels, identifies in which it needs to  undertake improvement s to remain competitive . In addition,  the analysis mentions factors that have the potential to harm   the research laboratory or that could provide a strategic  advant age to it. TABLE IV.

The Fig.  1 shows some  Laboratory challenges.   Aiming to address these issues, we propose an approach  based on Total Quality Management techniques that can  provide  adequate solutions to digitalize manage and steer  the  entire laboratory. The following section presents the proposed approach.   TABLE VIII.

Our case  study consists of proposing an innovative approach to properly  digitalize and manage the research laboratory.   The proposed approach can be divided in the workflow as  shown in Fig.  2. This digital transition impacts the overall  functioning of companies and disrupts working methods and processes, which requires the use of managerial approaches  for a long- term vision  to remain competitive, efficient , and  modern [57]–[59].  Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 describe the steps and tools that we used  to adopt a digital transformation in our research laboratory.   A. Knowledge Management using KMS -TQM Platform   The knowledge management concerns the way knowledge  is stocked and arranged . From a manager ial perspective, the  capitaliz ation of knowledge is a major  element in the  improvement of performance  via the establish ing of a  trustworthy resource base completed by appropriate software, and able to offer appropriate decision support.  The objective  of this function is to store relevant knowledge that assists  actors in their operations  [50].  In this work, w e
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,   Vol. 13, No. 9, 2022  377 | Page   www.ijacsa.thesai.org  According to the points above, we have decided that  adopting a digital transformation could solve this issue, thus  digitizing, managing, and eventually repositioning the  research laboratory within the university.   This work emphasizes using a knowledge management  system (KMS) capable of filling all the gaps me ntioned.   To successfully conduct this resear ch, we focused on the  following three research questions:   • How can the laboratory develop the digital  transformation strategy?   • How clear does the management in the Lab understand  the needs for a digital transformation of its organization?   • How does the labor atory apply digital technologies and  managerial practices in its processes?   To answer the research questions, t he main contributions  of this work are the following:   • Defining the factors and limits that have forced us to  adopt a digital transfor mation using  the SWOT  analysis.   • Using a Knowledge Management System that  combines all the TQM aspects  to manage the whole  structure.   • Standardize all the research structure processes to be  expressed explicitly.   The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section I I  presents the related works and the problematic. Section III describes the proposed approach. Section IV shows the  implementation using KMS -TQM digital platform and Bizagi  Modeler. Finally, section V concludes the current work and proposes the perspective s.  II. R ELATED WORKS   Due to new needs and requirements, several sectors have  used digitalization to obtain a competitive advantage and ensure continuity [20], [21]. To discuss the state of the art, we  propose the following subsections that determine each aspect  of our work: Digitalization and Digital transformation, Knowled ge Management, Business process Re -engineering,  and their applications in the context of
Knowled ge Management, Business process Re -engineering,  and their applications in the context of HEIs.   A. Digitalization and Digital Transformation   According to [12] , the COVID- 19 pandemic has confirmed  the need and importance of digitalization  in public and private  organizations. It was an opportunity to innovate and accelerate  the digital transformation to ensure the continuity and  sustainability of organizations. To define the term 'Digitalization' and ‘Digital Transformation’, the following  Table V illustrates some definitions proposed in the literat ure.  As pointed out in [25] , digital competence is considered as  a set of skills, knowledge , and attitudes necessar y to use ICT  and digital devic es for responsibilities such as information  management, and collaboration in an effective, efficient and  ethical way. Digital transformation is considered a well-known topic at the moment, and ideas for digital products,  facilities,  and media were already widely understood in the  1990s and 2000s [26] .  TABLE V.  DIGITALIZATION AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION  DEFINITIONS   Ref Definition   [22] Digitalization is a " sustainable company -level transformation via  revised or newly created business operations and business models  achieved through value -added digitalization initiatives, ultimately  resulting in improved profitability ."  [23] The digitaliz ation is " the application of any digital technologies to all  human activities, such as personal life, social, economic and political  activities ."  [24] Digital transformation is “ a proc ess that aims to improve an entity by  triggering significant changes to its properties through combinations  of information, computing, communication, and connectivity  technologies .”  “Each organizational transformation implies a cultural  transformation”, the introduction of new technologies and  digitalization has strongly contributed to the organizational and cultural transformation of companies [27] .
has strongly contributed to the organizational and cultural transformation of companies [27] . Digital  transformation has caused a significant change in the business,  both in its activities, its organization and even in its culture  [28]. Digital transformation is the integration of new processes  within the company, such as adopting new technologies, tools,  and work methods [29]. It impacts the global functioning of  companies and transfo rms working methods and processes,  requiring managerial approaches for a long -term vision to  remain competitive, efficient, and modern [30] .  B. Total Quality Management   Total quality management is a managerial approach that  began  in Japanese industry and has received increased  attention in the West since the early 1980s [31], [32].  Total  quality refer s to a company’s  culture, attitude, and  organization that attempts to consistently offer  its customers  products and services that fulfil l their expectations [33] .  TQM is a quality management approach whose target  is to  achieve ideal quality, the entire company s hould be mobilized  and involved, by reducing waste as much as poss ible and by  continuously improving the output elements  [28]. Many agree  that the TQM movement began in Japan, the term TQM  comes from TQC, it was coined by A.V. Freignbaum, 1983   [34], [35] . Organizations that have successfully used the  principles of TQM, have integrated the customer and quality  into their business strategy  [36]. It is the result of the efforts  made to develop Qualit y Management.   Important aspects of TQM  encompass  quality management  leadership and commitment, continuous improvement, rapid response, evidence -based actions, employee involvement, and  a TQM culture [37].  In the context  of higher education, s everal quality  management models developed for use in industry have been  involved in HEIs around the world  [43], such as TQM,  EFQM, Balanced scorecard, Malcolm Baldridge award, ISO  9000,
around the world  [43], such as TQM,  EFQM, Balanced scorecard, Malcolm Baldridge award, ISO  9000, Business process re -engineering and SERVQUAL.  One  of the most well- known quality management models that have
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,   Vol. 13, No. 9, 2022  378 | Page   www.ijacsa.thesai.org  been implemented in higher education is T otal Quality  Management (TQM) as described in Table VI [44] .  The study [45]  define s the seven TQM factors as follows:   Leadership , Strategic planning , Human resource management ,  Customer orientation , Process management , Information  analysis , and Continuous process improvement . Through  the implication of TQM concepts , assists organizations  in  learning strategies to increase productivity.  The dimensions of  TQM indicate the broad ra nge of features  in organizational  cultures that promote  innovation. Yet, the success of TQM  demands  an organizational culture based on trust and  knowledge sharing [46].  TABLE VI.  TQM  APPLICATIONS IN HEI S  Ref Year  Overview   [38] 2018 Through a review of the literature, this research aims to  examine the impact of TQM on the organizational  performance of Portuguese universities and polytechnic  higher education institutions. The purpose of this study is to  point out the importance of quality in education, specif ically  in HEIs, as indicated by the recent studies, the existing  literature has highlighted the fact that educational institutions  are lagging behind other organizations in terms of total  quality culture.   [39] 2019 This research represents a survey done at two Swedish  universities, and it attempts to determine teacher educators'  use of digitalization technologies and the resulting demand  for digital competence in highe r education. Digital  competence involves, among other factors, acquiring and  familiarizing with various digital tools and apps to utilize  Internet and digital technology is a critical and educative  approach.   [40] 2019 The digital transformation strategy seeks to create the capacity to fully use the potential of new technolog ies in a  fast and innovative manner in the future. The study proves
the potential of new technolog ies in a  fast and innovative manner in the future. The study proves that planning and implementing infrastructure allow all  students and staff to effectively communicate, share  information, and collaborate in research skills, thus  improving teaching and le arning and supporting  administrative functions, students, and staff to use computer systems to boost their digital skills.   [41] 2020 This work represents a bibliometric of 1590 papers from the Scopus database. In the education sector, the Digital  transformation has necessitated the implementation of  a  long-term management strategy. The authors conclude that  HEIs are progressing in managing their economic, environmental, and social sustainability, concerning digital  transformation to reach the model of an open, digital,  innovative, and connected insti tution.   [42] 2022 Higher education institutions around the world have used  numerous quality management strategies. As mentioned in  this work, with the growing interest of the quality measures  for sustained growth in education, the potential of  developing a paradigm that reflects t he challenges of higher  education while including comprehensive quality and social responsibility ought to be considered. Therefore, the authors  proposed an approach that connects the TQM and social  responsibility of organizations and higher education  institutions.   Recently , knowledge management by the company has  constituted  a sustainable competitive advantage, forming a  common point with the objectives of the quality approach:  obtaining a competitive advantage [47]. Not only knowledge management, but the implementation of business process  management also help s organizations enhance their capacities  through individual knowledge resources and greater collective  knowledge of the organization.   The decision to manage the laboratory knowledge needs to  set a standardized process by redesigning the actual processes.   The
knowledge needs to  set a standardized process by redesigning the actual processes.   The following subsections define knowledge manage ment  and  business process re -engineering .  C. Knowledge Management   Knowledge is a valuable, scarce and non -substitutable  resource that enables an organization to gain a sustainable  competitive advantage [38]. It is a set  of experiences, values,  information and  ideas to assess and integrate new knowledge  and experiences . Knowledge is an intangible attribute that is  practically impossible to simulate and is considered a strategic  asset that has to be effectively managed by every organization   [48]. It can be explicit or tacit.   Knowledge management is the process of getting the right  knowledge to the right person at the right time. M oreover ,  knowledge management aims to  explicit the tacit knowledge   by systematizing large sets of know ledge and gathering  individual knowledge [49], [50] . The purpose is to produce  valuable knowledge, fulfill the knowledge demands of  customers, perform knowledge and innovations and strengthen  the basic competitiveness of an organization  [51]. The KM  approach is the integration of individuals, methods and technologies implied in planning and implementing the  infrastruc ture of the educational institution s [52].  Therefore, t he process of know ledge implies four  steps :  creation, retrieval/storage, transfer and application  [53]. The  different components  of KM as cited in these works  [53] in  Table VII include  five elements :  TABLE VII.  ELEMENTS  OF KM  Knowledge  Creation  The organization’s ability to create and communicate  knowledge in its services, and systems. The process of  knowledge creation consists in capturing a part of tacit  knowledge and transforming it into explicit knowledge.   Knowledge   Application  The most important step in knowledge management is to  ensure that knowledge is productively applicable for the  organization's benefit, aiming to --- is to  ensure that knowledge is productively applicable for the  organization's benefit, aiming to maximize performance.   Knowledge Sharing  Knowledge sharing is a range of behaviors that include  sharing information or helping others to inspire innovative behavior.   Knowledge Capitalization  (Storage)  It consists in identifying its crucial knowledge, preserving  it and making it sustainable while ensuring that it is shared  and used by the greatest nu mber of people. Without this  capitalization effort, collective knowledge does not exist.   Knowledge  Transfer It is the process of transferring knowledge between individuals, groups or organizations using various means or  channels of communication.

Busines s Process Re -engineering – BPR  Today, quality is identified by the process approach  of the   activities. The management of processes is a strategy adopted  by organi zations that want to become more efficient ; it would  make them more efficient in executing  their processes and  ultimately more competitiv e [54]. The term of ‘process  approach’ first appeared in its 2000 version:  "the application  of the proces s system  within an organization, as well as the  identification, interactions and management of these processes" . This definition summariz es the requirements of a  management system of quality , and treats the  customer  satisfaction by adding value to each process.   The process approach has been described and established  as the quality management basis in organizations throug h the  ISO 9001 version 2015 standard. It allows to identify, map the  processes, and understand their interactions in an organization  [55]. In addition, according to FD X50- 176 standard, “ Process  management can be applied to all types of organizations  regardless of their size, activity, and to the various  management systems implemented (quality, safety,  environment, etc.) ”[56].  E. Use case: Research Laboratory LAROSERI   1) Description : The LAROSERI research laboratory was  created in 2014. It belongs to the Computer Science  Department in the Faculty of Science in El Jadida, Morocco.  LAROSERI includes four  research teams as described in  Table VIII.   2) Challenges:  The main objective of this st udy is to  reposition the Chouaib Doukkali University in scientific research, by applying the Total Quality Management and using a Knowledge Management System .

Therefore, we  chose the Bizagi  Modeler tool for process modeling  in order  to make explicit  all the existing processes within the laboratory . The choice of  this robust process management tool aims to redesign the  research laboratory process, thus  integrating all actors,  functions, tasks, etc.   Bizagi4 is a free BPM tool  (for a single user) to create,  optimize and publish a  process.

Research Laboratory D igitalization and Management using KMS - TQM Digital Platform .  In this work, we intend to digitalize all the actual processes  and make them as a standard in our Laboratory.   IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   In this section, we will apply the proposed approach , first  by using KMS -TQM digital platform to digitalize and manage  knowled ge, then by using the Bizagi Modeler to manage the  laboratory processes.   The purpose of capitalizing knowledge in our case is to  make explicit functions, tasks, and competencies. It answers  the question: who did what and how ?  By using the KMS -TQM platform , we generate the  function sheets of each position in the research laboratory. We  have assigned to each position a function(s) that is linked to  numerous tasks and competencies.   The first step is to create the organizational entities and  assign each to a parent entity. For instance, in our case, a doctoral studies center depends on the doctoral college as  mentioned in Fig . 5.  The next step is to create competencies referential to tasks.  Then, assigning each task to an appropriate function becomes possible, a nd defining the function first manager and  assignments. Fig. 6 -8 below illustrate the entity's  management,  tasks, and function management.   After preparing functions with their owners, the platform  proposes to generate a functional or organizational sheet. It  summarizes all the functions depending on their relationship. Fig. 9 describes an example of the functional sheet.     Fig. 5.  Entities Management .   Fig. 6.  Functions Management .    Fig. 7.  Tasks Management .    Fig. 8.  Affecting Tasks to F unction .

CONCLUSION   In summary, the TQM applications aiming to digitalize  and manage research structures are still very weak. This paper  analyzes the factors to adopt a digital transformation in the  research laboratory by applying the SWOT analysis and gives  an overview of some available recent studies that apply this  approach in the same context. The main objective of our  research is to integrate a Knowledge Manag ement System and  apply TQM aspects, which can apply to any research laboratory that desires to adopt a digital transformation. The  proposed approach briefly describes the steps to be followed  to digitalize and manage knowledge and redesign the current processes.   Despite the advantages of the research approach, some  limitations can be addressed through future research; the  platform used in the implementation does not link process  modeling with other modules, which means integration issues.  Therefore, to prop ose a suitable and adaptable solution, it will  be more practical to think of an open -source so lution with  huge possibilities.   In future work, as mentioned, we intend to conduct a  comparative study between laboratory management information systems (LIMS) by  selecting specific criteria to  propose an adequate digital framework. The framework will combine the quality management system (QMS) aspects and  integrate innovative solutions to digitalize and manage  research structures.
