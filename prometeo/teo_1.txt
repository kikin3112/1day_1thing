Structure and Discretion: Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy Kenneth J. Meier Texas A&M University John Bohte Oakland University ABSTRACT Studies of representative bureaucracy highlight both passive and active forms of representation. Passive representation refers to similarities in demographic characteristics between bureau- crats and client populations. Active representation refers to situations in which bureaucracies work to further the needs of a particular group of people. In this study, we examine the role employee discretion plays in linking passive and active forms of representation in a sample of six hundred school districts in Texas. Specifically, we argue that active representation is enhanced in organizations that vest greater discretion in their employees. Our study reveals that minority student performance improves under organizational structures that promote, rather than limit, minority teacher discretion. Bureaucracies are political institutions that are capable of representing the interests of citizens just as legislatures or executives do (Mosher 1969; Rourke 1984). Some bureaucracies are designed to be active representatives, to seek out and further the interests of a particular group of people (e.g., the original Department of Agriculture; the Department of Veteran's Affairs; the Office for Civil Rights [see Romzek and Hendricks 1982]). While most bureaucracies are not designated as active representa- tives, they still can perform representation functions. The theory We would like to thank the Department of r . . ... . ....

Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy public organizations, we will test the hypothesis that representa- tion will be more effective in organizations that vest greater discretion in their employees. Fourth, we will note the implica- tions of these results for a general theory of organizations. THE THEORY OF REPRESENTATIVE BUREAUCRACY Until ten years ago, the theory of representative bureaucracy was relatively simple (see Long 1952; Selden 1997). In every organization, individuals who make decisions exercise discretion because organization rules cannot cover every contingency and because organizational socialization is rarely total (Downs 1967; Thompson 1967). If individuals are assumed to be utility maxi- mizers, then individual bureaucrats with discretion are likely to use that discretion to make decisions diat reflect their own values. One source of these values is the socialization process, and one of the most enduring relationships in the United States is the impact of race and ethnicity on values (Carmines and Stimson 1989). Representative bureaucracy, thus, suggests that if a bureaucracy is broadly representative of the public it serves, then it is more likely to make decisions that benefit that public (Thielemann and Stewart 1996). In general the ability of bureaucrats to translate their values into public policy is affected by a variety of other factors (Saltz- stein 1979). Because the limits on representative bureaucracy in many cases are substantial (e.g., organizational socialization, structured jobs, lack of relevant decisions, location in the hier- archy, legal constraints; see Saltzstein 1979, 470; Selden 1997), research on the topic has shifted its focus to specifying the pre- cise ways that representative bureaucracies perform their func- tions and to assessing relevant policy impacts. For a representa- tive bureaucracy to translate from active to passive represen- tation, bureaucrats need to have policy discretion over an area that is directly
passive represen- tation, bureaucrats need to have policy discretion over an area that is directly linked to their values. Several works now specify when this is likely to happen. Meier (1993) finds that political support external to the organization facilitates the representation process and implies that relationships might not be linear. Selden (1997) introduces the concept of role and presents evidence that adopting the role of a representative is more important than demographic origins (i.e., race). Hindera (1993) finds in the EEOC that race and ethnicity, but not gender, are correlated with favorable decisions. Riccucci and Saidel (1997) examine the neglected role of political executives. One important concept in the theory of representative bur- eaucracy that has received little empirical attention, however, is 456/J-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024
'In his experimental study, Scott (1997) finds that organizational factors are generally more important than charac- teristics of the decision maker or the clientele, although all three factors influence the willingness to exercise discretion.Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy discretion. In organizations designed to be active representatives, discretion is of less importance because the organizations' goals are to represent; thus procedures can be established that enhance representation. In other bureaucracies, other goals take prece- dence. For representation to occur, bureaucrats must have a sphere of influence to take actions that reflect the specific values they hold. This implies that bureaucrats must have and exercise discretion in an area where the values are relevant and results can be observed. Discretion merely makes representation possible in such organizations; it does not mandate it. Consistent values (that is, values relevant to the concern being represented) and discre- tion are both necessary for a bureaucracy to be representative. The result should be a correlation between representative bureau- cracy and policies that benefit the represented (Saltzstein 1979, 472; Dolan 2000). STRUCTURE AND DISCRETION Although discretion is not an easy concept to measure, by restricting one's attention to organizations that perform the same general function one can begin to isolate the variable. An excel- lent review by Scott (1997) finds that discretion varies with organizational factors, characteristics of the decision maker, and aspects of the decision (such as type of clientele). This study will focus on the organizational element in discretion.1 Organizations use a variety of methods to structure and shape the actions of individual bureaucrats (Barnard 1938; Mintzberg 1979). Some organizations rely heavily on socialization (Kaufman 1960), others stress a common educational background or training (Mintz- berg's 1979 professional bureaucracy), and
a common educational background or training (Mintz- berg's 1979 professional bureaucracy), and still others rely strongly on the supervision and hierarchy. Scott (1997) links rules, red tape, and procedures to the extent of discretion. Mintz- berg, in particular, has paid a great deal of attention to control and he suggests that methods of control vary greatly across dif- ferent types of organizations. This variation across types of control, therefore, means that objective measures such as span of control have different meanings, depending on the type of organi- zation and how it is structured. Despite this variation, within a given type of organization a structural measure like span of control should be directly related to discretion. All thing being equal, the more individuals a person supervises, the more discretion that person must permit subordi- nates simply because the supervisor's time is limited (see Price and Mueller 1986; Golembiewski 1962; Meier and Bohte 2000). Similarly, if a subordinate knows that a supervisor must deal with fifteen subordinates rather than, say, five, the subordinate knows 451IJ-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024
2Scott (1997, 49), for example, shows that individuals who are trained as MPAs are different from those trained in social work in their willingness to exercise discretion in regard to welfare recipients.Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy that the supervisor must permit individuals to exercise more dis- cretion. Although individuals might vary on how much a change in span of control will affect the closeness of supervision, in general, and within the same type of organization, broader spans of control should be correlated with more street-level discretion (see Golembiewski 1962). The linkage between span of control and discretion is stronger if one views span of control from the perspective of the entire organization. Wide spans at one part of the organization can often be countered by narrow spans at other levels (Mintz- berg 1979). The best measure of structural discretion, therefore, considers spans of control at more than one level in the organiza- tion, if possible for the entire organization. THE STUDY DESIGN An ideal setting for a study of discretion and representative bureaucracy would be a set of organizations that all perform similar functions. Because functions and occupational mixes likely affect spans of control and also affect how closely they generate discretion (Mintzberg 1979; Scott 1997),2 only with a set of similar organizations employing the same types of person to perform the same task can we be sure that wider spans of con- trol necessarily translate into greater discretion at the lower levels of the organization. An ideal data set would also have measures of representation, measures of some output that could reflect discretionary decisions, and measures of organizational structure. The Texas school district data set fits these criteria. It contains information on 670 school districts, each with at least 500 students, over a four year period from 1994 to 1997, result- ing in a total of 2680 cases. In addition to measures of the key
period from 1994 to 1997, result- ing in a total of 2680 cases. In addition to measures of the key concepts (see below), teachers are the type of street-level bureaucrats (Lipsky 1980) that one would expect would exercise a great deal of discretion. Teachers are well-educated profes- sionals who interact with students on a continual basis with only modest direct supervision by administrators. An administrator who attempts to closely supervise a teacher needs to make a serious time commitment to monitor lesson plans, review course materials (that are often outside the administrator's area of expertise), and actually sit in on class sessions. This substantial time commitment means that as the number of teachers who report to each principal increases, a principal has even less time to devote to an individual teacher. Under such circumstances, teacher discretion should increase even more. 45&/J-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024
Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE Our dependent variable, used to measure the transformation of passive representation into active representation, is the per- centage of minority students who pass the Texas Assessment of Academic Standards (TAAS) exam. This is an annual standard- ized test given in grades 3-8 and as an exit exam that students must pass in order to graduate. The TAAS measures basic skills, but although basic skills are not the only objective of education systems, they are the essential building blocks to higher level skills and are a standard that frequently is used to assess school performance. The representation function for student test scores is more complicated than the representation function for granting loans to minority families (Selden 1997); deciding discrimination cases (Hindera 1993); or grouping, tracking, or disciplining students (Meier and Stewart 1991). A teacher cannot directly change a minority student's test score, but must somehow alter that stu- dent's educational experience so that the student performs better on exams. Minority teachers might affect minority student test scores in four distinct ways. First, minority teachers could serve as role models for minority students. Students with appropriate role models are likely to develop higher aspirations, and motivation is positively correlated with student performance (Cole 1986, 332). Second, teachers are key decision makers in many decisions that affect the quality of education available to students. Meier and Stewart (1991) find that minority teachers are associated with fewer minority students who are tracked into special education and more who are admitted to gifted classes. Minority teachers are also associated with more equitable disciplinary practices. Each of these factors should be positively related to minority student test scores. Third, minority teachers might well have additional insight into how to motivate and teach minority stu-
minority teachers might well have additional insight into how to motivate and teach minority stu- dents (Moore and Johnson 1983, 472; Aaron and Powell 1982, 55; but see Ehrenberg, Goldhaber, and Brewer 1995). Each minority teacher, after all, has also experienced the school system as a minority student. Fourth, in a provocative hypoth- esis, Meier, Wrinkle, and Polinard (1999), using the logic of Becker (1993), argue that we should expect representative bureaucracies to be more effective simply because they do not establish racial barriers to entry. That is, because such organi- zations have no preference for race, race will not offset decisions that normally would be based on employee productivity (Becker 1993). If representative bureaucracies are more effective, then 459/J-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024
Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy minority test scores should rise along with the test scores of white students. Given these four methods of influence, representative bureaucracies in education do not rely on teacher A teaching student B this year. A teacher's impact might have been in previous years, with the impact persisting over time through influence in tracking decisions, or even as a role model with no direct contact with the student at all. Representation, as a result, should be thought of as an organizational process rather than as an individual processes—what Weissberg (1978) calls collective rather than dyadic representation. Because an examination of the representation process at the individual level could miss one or more ways in which teachers might affect students, the appropri- ate level of analysis is the organization—in this case, the school district. INDEPENDENT VARIABLES Representation Representation is measured at the street level in this research; it is the percentage of the teaching faculty who are either African-American or Latino.3 The percentage measure is used rather than a ratio because the percentage measures indicate the likelihood that a minority student will come into contact with a teacher who is also a minority. These districts have an average of 12.8 percent minority faculty with a standard deviation of 19.5 (see exhibit 1). The measure is positively skewed; many districts have few or no minorities on their faculties, and a few districts have over 50 percent. The state of Texas provides information only for blacks. Latinos, and Anglos. All other minorities are grouped in the category other. Given the vast differ- ences between Asian-Americans and, say, Native Americans, this other category contains both advantaged and disadvan- taged students. Examining the other students along with the more traditional minorities, therefore, is somewhat prob- lematic.Exhibit 1 Descriptive Statistics Variable Minority pass rate Percent

Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy Discretion The second key independent variable is the structural measure of discretion. We have argued that wider spans of con- trol allow greater line discretion, all other things being equal. Two spans of control are of concern—first-line supervision and midmanagement. First-line supervision involves the supervision of teachers by administrators, usually principals. Spans of control at this first-line level are generally broad, reflecting the class- room autonomy of teachers; the first-line span of control measure was calculated by dividing the number of teachers in a district by the number of principals and assistant principals. For the districts in this study, first-line span of control variable averaged 13.8 with a standard deviation of 3.2. Midmanagement spans of control reflect the supervision of campus-level administrators (that is, principals and assistant principals) by central office administrators (assistant superinten- dents, etc.). These are measured by the ratio of campus-level administrators to central office administrators. At this level, spans of control are much narrower, averaging only 2.4 with a standard deviation of 1.3. Our argument on discretion suggested that overall spans of control in the organization, rather than simply those at one level, were the most important. In regard to schools, central office administrators can affect teachers' jobs in two ways. First, by closely supervising principals, they encourage principals to treat subordinates (teachers) in a similar manner. Second, central office administrators can proliferate reporting requirements that require teachers to spend their time conforming to organizational rules rather than focusing on their core functions. To create this multilevel measure, we multiplied the first-line span of control for the organization by the midmanagement level span of control. This figure represents the total number of persons under the direct or indirect
span of control. This figure represents the total number of persons under the direct or indirect supervision of the average central office admin- istrator. The mean for the districts was 34.6 with a standard deviation of 23.9. The measure is negatively skewed with a median of 29. This figure retains its substantive meaning. A overall span of control of 30, for example, indicates that a central office administrator supervises 30 employees. These employees might be clustered in a variety of ways. To illustrate, a midmanagement span of control of 5 and a first-line span of 6 would produce the same figure as a midmanagement span of 3 and a first line super- vision of 10. Larger overall spans, in theory, should produce less 461IJ-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024
Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy direct supervision and thus more discretion for teachers, all other things equal. Control Variables To assess the relationship between structure and representa- tion, several other factors that affect student performance must be added to the analysis as controls. Our goal is not to contribute to the education literature, and it is not to estimate the perfect education production function. Our objective is to assess the linkage between structure and representative bureaucracy. There- fore, we tried to include a wide range of controls even though this results in a degree of collinearity and that collinearity affects the wealth/income variables to a substantial degree. Eleven such controls will be included. Poverty, and thus social class, is negatively correlated with student performance on standardized tests and other indicators (Coleman 1966; Necochea and Cune 1996; Jencks and Phillips 1998). Learning takes place not only in school but also in the home. Middle-class students frequently have access to computers and other educational tools; they also tend to have access to better preschool programs. Other social class measures are included: the percent of students who are elig- ible for free or reduced-price lunches, the percent of black and Latino students, and median family income/ In the rapidly changing world of educational technology, teacher experience is an enigma. Traditionally, experienced teachers were considered to have an advantage, since the craft of teaching took time to learn. Each teacher eventually figured out what worked and what did not. At the same time, teacher train- ing has become more rigorous with higher standards, and in many states competency exams are in place. New techniques, including those for teaching disadvantaged students, continue to be developed. This suggests that teacher experience might actually be a detriment, simply because new teachers are better trained. Our measure of teacher

We also include a measure of teacher education—the percentage of teachers with at least an MA degree. Class size is at the center of many education reforms. Recent experimental studies with large numbers of students confirm that class size reductions are positively associated with The inclusion of all these variables ^ her smdent performance (Wenglinsky 1997) because teachers means that the impact of black students is ° , . .,.,...,. _. . the impact that is separate from any can sPend more tmie wlth individual students.

This relative comparison means that we cannot examine the provocative Meier et al. (1999) hypothesis about the influ- ence of minority teachers on nonminority students. 'Poverty is unrelated to performance, but only because it is collinear with a variety of other wealth measures that are included in this exhibit.Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy The impact of school finances on student performance has been controversial because several metanalyses by Hanushek (1986 and 1996) come to pessimistic conclusions. At the same time, another metanalysis arrives at more positive conclusions (Hedges and Greenwald 1996). Recent work that examines changes in school finances in a longitudinal framework rather than cross sectionally also finds that money does matter in educa- tional outcomes (Murray 1995; Evans, Murray, and Schwab 1997; Bohte 1999). Our measures of school resources are the dollars spent per student on instruction and the average teacher's salary. Two final control variables are district enrollment and the Anglo pass rate. District size might affect the potential size of the spans of control, and some literature links district size to student performance (Jencks and Phillips 1998). The Anglo pass rate is included to control for the overall quality of education delivered by the school district (see Weiher 2000; Jencks and Phillips 1998). This means that the percentage of minority teachers must be correlated with minority student performance even after con- trolling for Anglo student performance.5 ESTIMATION AND FINDINGS With 670 cases and four years of data, we have a pooled time series. Pooled data sets must address questions of serial correlation and can be affected by heteroscedasticity (Stimson 1985). To control for serial correlation, a series of dummy vari- ables for individual years was included in all regression equa- tions. Test scores in Texas have improved dramatically during the four years, and these controls adjust for that fact. Hetero-
have improved dramatically during the four years, and these controls adjust for that fact. Hetero- scedasticity was examined by assessing the residuals in each of the cross sections (i.e., the individual years). The residuals did not show any apparent signs of heteroscedasticity. As a check for this conclusion, we reestimated the models with appropriately weighted regressions and found similar results. To determine if our structural measure of discretion affects the representative bureaucracy relationship, we first estimated a base regression without considering structure. The results of that regression appear in exhibit 2. The control variables generally perform as expected with positive relationships for Anglo pass rates; family income; teachers' salaries and expenditures; and negative relationships for race, ethnicity, class size, and enroll- ment.6 For the teacher experience and education measures, the relationships are negative consistent with the notion that teacher training has benefited from recent improvements. The key vari- able of concern, however, is for minority teachers, and this rela- tionship is positive as expected. All other things equal, a one 463/J-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024

While this relationship is not large, it is significant and in line with other studies of minority teachers (Weiher 2000; Meier et al. 1999). If discretion mediates the relationship between active and passive representation, we would expect that minority teachers would have a greater impact on minority student test scores in organizations with wider spans of control.

This result is robust to different specifications and is not affected by including or excluding individual variables.Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy Exhibit 3 presents these two regressions, and they provide support for the hypothesis. In high discretion organizations, a 1 percentage point increase in minority teachers is associated with a .24 percentage point increase in minority student test scores, all other things being equal. The size of this relationship is approxi- mately 20 percent larger than the relationship in all organiza- tions. In low-discretion organizations, the relationship drops to .16. In low-discretion organizations the representation of teachers is associated with smaller gains for minority students compared to the gains in high-discretion organizations.8 A brief glance at the other coefficients suggests that repre- sentation is not the only organizational process affected by struc- ture. The coefficients for teachers' salaries, advanced degrees, family income, and low income students are also different from each other. While a full discussion of these differences is beyond the scope of this article, the differences suggest that structure could well be a significant variable that conditions a variety of processes and results in these organizations (see Scott 1997). In our introductory discussion we argued that one needs to look at the overall span of control in the organization rather than simply to examine it at one level. In order to verify our intuition, in exhibit 4 we replicate the results but use the average first-line span of control only (the ratio of teachers to campus administra- tors). High-discretion agencies have spans of control greater than 13.5 teachers per school administrator. Again the relationship for representation in high-discretion agencies increases slightly, and the relationship in low-discretion agencies falls slightly. The differences are not statistically significant. The interaction between representation
slightly. The differences are not statistically significant. The interaction between representation and discretion, therefore, exists only when the structure of the entire organization is considered. The implications of exhibits 3 and 4 are that structure should be considered to be an organizational-level concept. Changes in structure at one level of the organization can be compensated for with opposite changes at other levels of the organization (see Mintzberg 1979). Only by considering the overall structure of an organization can a manager be sure that structural changes are likely to have their intended impact on the organization. CONCLUSION Organizational structures that enhance discretion are desir- able because they transform passive representation into active representation for minority populations. In the present case, African-American and Hispanic students typically face a wider range of problems than middle-class white students.

Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy have advanced successfully through the educational system them- selves, minority teachers may possess special insights and skills that might be of use in educating minority students. Organiza- tional structures that promote discretion allow minority teachers to take concrete action in shaping the performance of minority students, turning passive teacher empathy with the problems of minority students into a proactive approach to solving problems. Our findings on one structural attribute, span of control, reveal that wide spans of control should lead to more operator discretion, which subsequently leads to improvements in organi- zational performance. One irony of bureaucratic organizations is that employees are often hired because they have expert knowl- edge in a particular area, but organizational rules and structures prevent them from using this knowledge as they see fit (Wilson 1989, 149). Teachers are hired precisely for their expertise in educating students, yet placing tight limits on their discretion may squander the package of skills tiiey bring to their jobs. Chubb and Moe (1990, 89), examining a sample of high- and low- performance American schools, found that teachers in academ- ically superior schools were entrusted with more responsibilities and discretion than their counterparts in low-performance schools. In regard to broader implications for organization theory, our findings on structure and discretion suggest that rigid structural controls over employee discretion are less necessary when employees are highly professionalized. Professionals operate under norms of conduct and, assuming that organizational leaders believe in the value of these professional norms, reducing structural controls over employee discretion is a viable option. This line of reasoning is not meant to imply that professional norms eliminate the need for structural controls over employee discretion. Rather, it suggests that professional
the need for structural controls over employee discretion. Rather, it suggests that professional norms are a conditioning agent mat moderates the need for tight structural controls over employee discretion. This study adds to the literature on representative bureau- cracy. Studies that have linked active and passive representation all have assumed that bureaucrats had discretion but made no attempt to measure it. Within similar types of organizations, structural measures of span of control are a reasonable estimate of individual discretion. Discretion, we find, strengthens the relationship between active and passive representation. Although this study focused on one type of organization only, it suggests that the linkage between structure and representation might also hold in otiier types of organizations. 468/J-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024

Structure and Discretion: Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy Kenneth J. Meier Texas A&M University John Bohte Oakland University ABSTRACT Studies of representative bureaucracy highlight both passive and active forms of representation. Passive representation refers to similarities in demographic characteristics between bureau- crats and client populations. Active representation refers to situations in which bureaucracies work to further the needs of a particular group of people. In this study, we examine the role employee discretion plays in linking passive and active forms of representation in a sample of six hundred school districts in Texas. Specifically, we argue that active representation is enhanced in organizations that vest greater discretion in their employees. Our study reveals that minority student performance improves under organizational structures that promote, rather than limit, minority teacher discretion. Bureaucracies are political institutions that are capable of representing the interests of citizens just as legislatures or executives do (Mosher 1969; Rourke 1984). Some bureaucracies are designed to be active representatives, to seek out and further the interests of a particular group of people (e.g., the original Department of Agriculture; the Department of Veteran's Affairs; the Office for Civil Rights [see Romzek and Hendricks 1982]). While most bureaucracies are not designated as active representa- tives, they still can perform representation functions. The theory We would like to thank the Department of r . . ... . .... Political Science and the George Bush of representative bureaucracy links passive representation (that is, School of Government and Public Service similar demographic origins) to active representation.

Although individuals might vary on how much a change in span of control will affect the closeness of supervision, in general, and within the same type of organization, broader spans of control should be correlated with more street-level discretion (see Golembiewski 1962). The linkage between span of control and discretion is stronger if one views span of control from the perspective of the entire organization. Wide spans at one part of the organization can often be countered by narrow spans at other levels (Mintz- berg 1979). The best measure of structural discretion, therefore, considers spans of control at more than one level in the organiza- tion, if possible for the entire organization. THE STUDY DESIGN An ideal setting for a study of discretion and representative bureaucracy would be a set of organizations that all perform similar functions. Because functions and occupational mixes likely affect spans of control and also affect how closely they generate discretion (Mintzberg 1979; Scott 1997),2 only with a set of similar organizations employing the same types of person to perform the same task can we be sure that wider spans of con- trol necessarily translate into greater discretion at the lower levels of the organization. An ideal data set would also have measures of representation, measures of some output that could reflect discretionary decisions, and measures of organizational structure. The Texas school district data set fits these criteria. It contains information on 670 school districts, each with at least 500 students, over a four year period from 1994 to 1997, result- ing in a total of 2680 cases. In addition to measures of the key
Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy public organizations, we will test the hypothesis that representa- tion will be more effective in organizations that vest greater discretion in their employees. Fourth, we will note the implica- tions of these results for a general theory of organizations. THE THEORY OF REPRESENTATIVE BUREAUCRACY Until ten years ago, the theory of representative bureaucracy was relatively simple (see Long 1952; Selden 1997). In every organization, individuals who make decisions exercise discretion because organization rules cannot cover every contingency and because organizational socialization is rarely total (Downs 1967; Thompson 1967). If individuals are assumed to be utility maxi- mizers, then individual bureaucrats with discretion are likely to use that discretion to make decisions diat reflect their own values. One source of these values is the socialization process, and one of the most enduring relationships in the United States is the impact of race and ethnicity on values (Carmines and Stimson 1989). Representative bureaucracy, thus, suggests that if a bureaucracy is broadly representative of the public it serves, then it is more likely to make decisions that benefit that public (Thielemann and Stewart 1996). In general the ability of bureaucrats to translate their values into public policy is affected by a variety of other factors (Saltz- stein 1979). Because the limits on representative bureaucracy in many cases are substantial (e.g., organizational socialization, structured jobs, lack of relevant decisions, location in the hier- archy, legal constraints; see Saltzstein 1979, 470; Selden 1997), research on the topic has shifted its focus to specifying the pre- cise ways that representative bureaucracies perform their func- tions and to assessing relevant policy impacts. For a representa- tive bureaucracy to translate from active to passive represen- tation, bureaucrats need to have policy discretion over an area that is directly --- passive represen- tation, bureaucrats need to have policy discretion over an area that is directly linked to their values. Several works now specify when this is likely to happen. Meier (1993) finds that political support external to the organization facilitates the representation process and implies that relationships might not be linear. Selden (1997) introduces the concept of role and presents evidence that adopting the role of a representative is more important than demographic origins (i.e., race). Hindera (1993) finds in the EEOC that race and ethnicity, but not gender, are correlated with favorable decisions. Riccucci and Saidel (1997) examine the neglected role of political executives. One important concept in the theory of representative bur- eaucracy that has received little empirical attention, however, is 456/J-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024
'In his experimental study, Scott (1997) finds that organizational factors are generally more important than charac- teristics of the decision maker or the clientele, although all three factors influence the willingness to exercise discretion.Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy discretion. In organizations designed to be active representatives, discretion is of less importance because the organizations' goals are to represent; thus procedures can be established that enhance representation. In other bureaucracies, other goals take prece- dence. For representation to occur, bureaucrats must have a sphere of influence to take actions that reflect the specific values they hold. This implies that bureaucrats must have and exercise discretion in an area where the values are relevant and results can be observed. Discretion merely makes representation possible in such organizations; it does not mandate it. Consistent values (that is, values relevant to the concern being represented) and discre- tion are both necessary for a bureaucracy to be representative. The result should be a correlation between representative bureau- cracy and policies that benefit the represented (Saltzstein 1979, 472; Dolan 2000). STRUCTURE AND DISCRETION Although discretion is not an easy concept to measure, by restricting one's attention to organizations that perform the same general function one can begin to isolate the variable. An excel- lent review by Scott (1997) finds that discretion varies with organizational factors, characteristics of the decision maker, and aspects of the decision (such as type of clientele). This study will focus on the organizational element in discretion.1 Organizations use a variety of methods to structure and shape the actions of individual bureaucrats (Barnard 1938; Mintzberg 1979). Some organizations rely heavily on socialization (Kaufman 1960), others stress a common educational background or training (Mintz- berg's 1979 professional bureaucracy), and
a common educational background or training (Mintz- berg's 1979 professional bureaucracy), and still others rely strongly on the supervision and hierarchy. Scott (1997) links rules, red tape, and procedures to the extent of discretion. Mintz- berg, in particular, has paid a great deal of attention to control and he suggests that methods of control vary greatly across dif- ferent types of organizations. This variation across types of control, therefore, means that objective measures such as span of control have different meanings, depending on the type of organi- zation and how it is structured. Despite this variation, within a given type of organization a structural measure like span of control should be directly related to discretion. All thing being equal, the more individuals a person supervises, the more discretion that person must permit subordi- nates simply because the supervisor's time is limited (see Price and Mueller 1986; Golembiewski 1962; Meier and Bohte 2000). Similarly, if a subordinate knows that a supervisor must deal with fifteen subordinates rather than, say, five, the subordinate knows 451IJ-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024
period from 1994 to 1997, result- ing in a total of 2680 cases. In addition to measures of the key concepts (see below), teachers are the type of street-level bureaucrats (Lipsky 1980) that one would expect would exercise a great deal of discretion. Teachers are well-educated profes- sionals who interact with students on a continual basis with only modest direct supervision by administrators. An administrator who attempts to closely supervise a teacher needs to make a serious time commitment to monitor lesson plans, review course materials (that are often outside the administrator's area of expertise), and actually sit in on class sessions. This substantial time commitment means that as the number of teachers who report to each principal increases, a principal has even less time to devote to an individual teacher. Under such circumstances, teacher discretion should increase even more. 45&/J-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024
Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE Our dependent variable, used to measure the transformation of passive representation into active representation, is the per- centage of minority students who pass the Texas Assessment of Academic Standards (TAAS) exam. This is an annual standard- ized test given in grades 3-8 and as an exit exam that students must pass in order to graduate. The TAAS measures basic skills, but although basic skills are not the only objective of education systems, they are the essential building blocks to higher level skills and are a standard that frequently is used to assess school performance. The representation function for student test scores is more complicated than the representation function for granting loans to minority families (Selden 1997); deciding discrimination cases (Hindera 1993); or grouping, tracking, or disciplining students (Meier and Stewart 1991). A teacher cannot directly change a minority student's test score, but must somehow alter that stu- dent's educational experience so that the student performs better on exams. Minority teachers might affect minority student test scores in four distinct ways. First, minority teachers could serve as role models for minority students. Students with appropriate role models are likely to develop higher aspirations, and motivation is positively correlated with student performance (Cole 1986, 332). Second, teachers are key decision makers in many decisions that affect the quality of education available to students. Meier and Stewart (1991) find that minority teachers are associated with fewer minority students who are tracked into special education and more who are admitted to gifted classes. Minority teachers are also associated with more equitable disciplinary practices. Each of these factors should be positively related to minority student test scores. Third, minority teachers might well have additional insight into how to motivate and teach minority stu-
minority teachers might well have additional insight into how to motivate and teach minority stu- dents (Moore and Johnson 1983, 472; Aaron and Powell 1982, 55; but see Ehrenberg, Goldhaber, and Brewer 1995). Each minority teacher, after all, has also experienced the school system as a minority student. Fourth, in a provocative hypoth- esis, Meier, Wrinkle, and Polinard (1999), using the logic of Becker (1993), argue that we should expect representative bureaucracies to be more effective simply because they do not establish racial barriers to entry. That is, because such organi- zations have no preference for race, race will not offset decisions that normally would be based on employee productivity (Becker 1993). If representative bureaucracies are more effective, then 459/J-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024
Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy minority test scores should rise along with the test scores of white students. Given these four methods of influence, representative bureaucracies in education do not rely on teacher A teaching student B this year. A teacher's impact might have been in previous years, with the impact persisting over time through influence in tracking decisions, or even as a role model with no direct contact with the student at all. Representation, as a result, should be thought of as an organizational process rather than as an individual processes—what Weissberg (1978) calls collective rather than dyadic representation. Because an examination of the representation process at the individual level could miss one or more ways in which teachers might affect students, the appropri- ate level of analysis is the organization—in this case, the school district. INDEPENDENT VARIABLES Representation Representation is measured at the street level in this research; it is the percentage of the teaching faculty who are either African-American or Latino.3 The percentage measure is used rather than a ratio because the percentage measures indicate the likelihood that a minority student will come into contact with a teacher who is also a minority. These districts have an average of 12.8 percent minority faculty with a standard deviation of 19.5 (see exhibit 1). The measure is positively skewed; many districts have few or no minorities on their faculties, and a few districts have over 50 percent. The state of Texas provides information only for blacks. Latinos, and Anglos. All other minorities are grouped in the category other. Given the vast differ- ences between Asian-Americans and, say, Native Americans, this other category contains both advantaged and disadvan- taged students. Examining the other students along with the more traditional minorities, therefore, is somewhat prob- lematic.Exhibit 1 Descriptive Statistics Variable Minority pass rate Percent

Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy Discretion The second key independent variable is the structural measure of discretion. We have argued that wider spans of con- trol allow greater line discretion, all other things being equal. Two spans of control are of concern—first-line supervision and midmanagement. First-line supervision involves the supervision of teachers by administrators, usually principals. Spans of control at this first-line level are generally broad, reflecting the class- room autonomy of teachers; the first-line span of control measure was calculated by dividing the number of teachers in a district by the number of principals and assistant principals. For the districts in this study, first-line span of control variable averaged 13.8 with a standard deviation of 3.2. Midmanagement spans of control reflect the supervision of campus-level administrators (that is, principals and assistant principals) by central office administrators (assistant superinten- dents, etc.). These are measured by the ratio of campus-level administrators to central office administrators. At this level, spans of control are much narrower, averaging only 2.4 with a standard deviation of 1.3. Our argument on discretion suggested that overall spans of control in the organization, rather than simply those at one level, were the most important. In regard to schools, central office administrators can affect teachers' jobs in two ways. First, by closely supervising principals, they encourage principals to treat subordinates (teachers) in a similar manner. Second, central office administrators can proliferate reporting requirements that require teachers to spend their time conforming to organizational rules rather than focusing on their core functions. To create this multilevel measure, we multiplied the first-line span of control for the organization by the midmanagement level span of control. This figure represents the total number of persons under the direct or indirect
span of control. This figure represents the total number of persons under the direct or indirect supervision of the average central office admin- istrator. The mean for the districts was 34.6 with a standard deviation of 23.9. The measure is negatively skewed with a median of 29. This figure retains its substantive meaning. A overall span of control of 30, for example, indicates that a central office administrator supervises 30 employees. These employees might be clustered in a variety of ways. To illustrate, a midmanagement span of control of 5 and a first-line span of 6 would produce the same figure as a midmanagement span of 3 and a first line super- vision of 10. Larger overall spans, in theory, should produce less 461IJ-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024
Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy direct supervision and thus more discretion for teachers, all other things equal. Control Variables To assess the relationship between structure and representa- tion, several other factors that affect student performance must be added to the analysis as controls. Our goal is not to contribute to the education literature, and it is not to estimate the perfect education production function. Our objective is to assess the linkage between structure and representative bureaucracy. There- fore, we tried to include a wide range of controls even though this results in a degree of collinearity and that collinearity affects the wealth/income variables to a substantial degree. Eleven such controls will be included. Poverty, and thus social class, is negatively correlated with student performance on standardized tests and other indicators (Coleman 1966; Necochea and Cune 1996; Jencks and Phillips 1998). Learning takes place not only in school but also in the home. Middle-class students frequently have access to computers and other educational tools; they also tend to have access to better preschool programs. Other social class measures are included: the percent of students who are elig- ible for free or reduced-price lunches, the percent of black and Latino students, and median family income/ In the rapidly changing world of educational technology, teacher experience is an enigma. Traditionally, experienced teachers were considered to have an advantage, since the craft of teaching took time to learn. Each teacher eventually figured out what worked and what did not. At the same time, teacher train- ing has become more rigorous with higher standards, and in many states competency exams are in place. New techniques, including those for teaching disadvantaged students, continue to be developed. This suggests that teacher experience might actually be a detriment, simply because new teachers are better trained. Our measure of teacher

We also include a measure of teacher education—the percentage of teachers with at least an MA degree. Class size is at the center of many education reforms. Recent experimental studies with large numbers of students confirm that class size reductions are positively associated with The inclusion of all these variables ^ her smdent performance (Wenglinsky 1997) because teachers means that the impact of black students is ° , . .,.,...,. _. . the impact that is separate from any can sPend more tmie wlth individual students. Disadvantaged influences resulting from income or students appear to benefit more from class size reductions than P°verty- do students who are not disadvantaged (Bohte 1999). 462/J-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024
This relative comparison means that we cannot examine the provocative Meier et al. (1999) hypothesis about the influ- ence of minority teachers on nonminority students. 'Poverty is unrelated to performance, but only because it is collinear with a variety of other wealth measures that are included in this exhibit.Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy The impact of school finances on student performance has been controversial because several metanalyses by Hanushek (1986 and 1996) come to pessimistic conclusions. At the same time, another metanalysis arrives at more positive conclusions (Hedges and Greenwald 1996). Recent work that examines changes in school finances in a longitudinal framework rather than cross sectionally also finds that money does matter in educa- tional outcomes (Murray 1995; Evans, Murray, and Schwab 1997; Bohte 1999). Our measures of school resources are the dollars spent per student on instruction and the average teacher's salary. Two final control variables are district enrollment and the Anglo pass rate. District size might affect the potential size of the spans of control, and some literature links district size to student performance (Jencks and Phillips 1998). The Anglo pass rate is included to control for the overall quality of education delivered by the school district (see Weiher 2000; Jencks and Phillips 1998). This means that the percentage of minority teachers must be correlated with minority student performance even after con- trolling for Anglo student performance.5 ESTIMATION AND FINDINGS With 670 cases and four years of data, we have a pooled time series. Pooled data sets must address questions of serial correlation and can be affected by heteroscedasticity (Stimson 1985). To control for serial correlation, a series of dummy vari- ables for individual years was included in all regression equa- tions. Test scores in Texas have improved dramatically during the four years, and these controls adjust for that fact. Hetero-
have improved dramatically during the four years, and these controls adjust for that fact. Hetero- scedasticity was examined by assessing the residuals in each of the cross sections (i.e., the individual years). The residuals did not show any apparent signs of heteroscedasticity. As a check for this conclusion, we reestimated the models with appropriately weighted regressions and found similar results. To determine if our structural measure of discretion affects the representative bureaucracy relationship, we first estimated a base regression without considering structure. The results of that regression appear in exhibit 2. The control variables generally perform as expected with positive relationships for Anglo pass rates; family income; teachers' salaries and expenditures; and negative relationships for race, ethnicity, class size, and enroll- ment.6 For the teacher experience and education measures, the relationships are negative consistent with the notion that teacher training has benefited from recent improvements. The key vari- able of concern, however, is for minority teachers, and this rela- tionship is positive as expected. All other things equal, a one 463/J-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024

While this relationship is not large, it is significant and in line with other studies of minority teachers (Weiher 2000; Meier et al. 1999). If discretion mediates the relationship between active and passive representation, we would expect that minority teachers would have a greater impact on minority student test scores in organizations with wider spans of control. We divide our set of schools into those with a discretion measure of greater than 29 (the median) and those with a discretion measure of less than 29.7 If our hypothesis is correct, the size of the regression slope
discretion measure of less than 29.7 If our hypothesis is correct, the size of the regression slope for the high-discretion organizations should be larger than the size of the slope for the low-discretion organizations. 464/J-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024
This result is robust to different specifications and is not affected by including or excluding individual variables.Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy Exhibit 3 presents these two regressions, and they provide support for the hypothesis. In high discretion organizations, a 1 percentage point increase in minority teachers is associated with a .24 percentage point increase in minority student test scores, all other things being equal. The size of this relationship is approxi- mately 20 percent larger than the relationship in all organiza- tions. In low-discretion organizations, the relationship drops to .16. In low-discretion organizations the representation of teachers is associated with smaller gains for minority students compared to the gains in high-discretion organizations.8 A brief glance at the other coefficients suggests that repre- sentation is not the only organizational process affected by struc- ture. The coefficients for teachers' salaries, advanced degrees, family income, and low income students are also different from each other. While a full discussion of these differences is beyond the scope of this article, the differences suggest that structure could well be a significant variable that conditions a variety of processes and results in these organizations (see Scott 1997). In our introductory discussion we argued that one needs to look at the overall span of control in the organization rather than simply to examine it at one level. In order to verify our intuition, in exhibit 4 we replicate the results but use the average first-line span of control only (the ratio of teachers to campus administra- tors). High-discretion agencies have spans of control greater than 13.5 teachers per school administrator. Again the relationship for representation in high-discretion agencies increases slightly, and the relationship in low-discretion agencies falls slightly. The differences are not statistically significant. The interaction between representation
slightly. The differences are not statistically significant. The interaction between representation and discretion, therefore, exists only when the structure of the entire organization is considered. The implications of exhibits 3 and 4 are that structure should be considered to be an organizational-level concept. Changes in structure at one level of the organization can be compensated for with opposite changes at other levels of the organization (see Mintzberg 1979). Only by considering the overall structure of an organization can a manager be sure that structural changes are likely to have their intended impact on the organization. CONCLUSION Organizational structures that enhance discretion are desir- able because they transform passive representation into active representation for minority populations. In the present case, African-American and Hispanic students typically face a wider range of problems than middle-class white students.

Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy have advanced successfully through the educational system them- selves, minority teachers may possess special insights and skills that might be of use in educating minority students. Organiza- tional structures that promote discretion allow minority teachers to take concrete action in shaping the performance of minority students, turning passive teacher empathy with the problems of minority students into a proactive approach to solving problems. Our findings on one structural attribute, span of control, reveal that wide spans of control should lead to more operator discretion, which subsequently leads to improvements in organi- zational performance. One irony of bureaucratic organizations is that employees are often hired because they have expert knowl- edge in a particular area, but organizational rules and structures prevent them from using this knowledge as they see fit (Wilson 1989, 149). Teachers are hired precisely for their expertise in educating students, yet placing tight limits on their discretion may squander the package of skills tiiey bring to their jobs. Chubb and Moe (1990, 89), examining a sample of high- and low- performance American schools, found that teachers in academ- ically superior schools were entrusted with more responsibilities and discretion than their counterparts in low-performance schools. In regard to broader implications for organization theory, our findings on structure and discretion suggest that rigid structural controls over employee discretion are less necessary when employees are highly professionalized. Professionals operate under norms of conduct and, assuming that organizational leaders believe in the value of these professional norms, reducing structural controls over employee discretion is a viable option. This line of reasoning is not meant to imply that professional norms eliminate the need for structural controls over employee discretion. Rather, it suggests that professional
the need for structural controls over employee discretion. Rather, it suggests that professional norms are a conditioning agent mat moderates the need for tight structural controls over employee discretion. This study adds to the literature on representative bureau- cracy. Studies that have linked active and passive representation all have assumed that bureaucrats had discretion but made no attempt to measure it. Within similar types of organizations, structural measures of span of control are a reasonable estimate of individual discretion. Discretion, we find, strengthens the relationship between active and passive representation. Although this study focused on one type of organization only, it suggests that the linkage between structure and representation might also hold in otiier types of organizations. 468/J-PART, October 2001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/11/4/455/896259 by Universidad Nacional de Colombia user on 12 August 2024

El artículo "Structure and Discretion: Missing Links in Representative Bureaucracy" de Kenneth J. Meier y John Bohte examina la interacción entre la burocracia representativa y la discreción de los empleados, centrándose en los distritos escolares de Texas. Se diferencia entre dos tipos de representación: la pasiva, que se basa en la similitud demográfica entre burócratas y la población a la que sirven, y la activa, que implica un esfuerzo consciente por parte de la burocracia para satisfacer las necesidades de un grupo específico.

Los autores sostienen que la representación activa se potencia en organizaciones que otorgan mayor discreción a sus empleados. A través de un análisis de 600 distritos escolares en Texas, se concluye que el rendimiento académico de los estudiantes de minorías mejora en estructuras que fomentan la autonomía de los maestros de minorías, sugiriendo que la capacidad de los burócratas para actuar en beneficio de sus comunidades está relacionada con su libertad en la toma de decisiones.

El artículo también señala que, aunque muchas burocracias no están diseñadas explícitamente para ser representativas activas, pueden desempeñar funciones de representación. Se citan ejemplos históricos de burocracias que han representado intereses específicos, como el Departamento de Agricultura y la Oficina de Derechos Civiles.

El estudio amplía la literatura sobre burocracia representativa al centrarse en la discreción, sugiriendo que una mayor autonomía de los empleados puede facilitar una representación más efectiva de las necesidades de las poblaciones a las que sirven. A continuación, se detallan los puntos clave del texto:

1. **Teoría de la Burocracia Representativa**: Se establece que la composición demográfica de los funcionarios públicos debe reflejar la diversidad de la población a la que sirven, lo que puede influir en la discreción en la toma de decisiones.

2. **Medida Estructural de la Discreción**: Se propone una medida estructural de la discreción, evaluando cómo la estructura organizativa afecta la capacidad de los empleados para ejercer discreción.

3. **Relación entre Control y Discreción**: Se argumenta que la supervisión y el control influyen en la cantidad de discreción que los empleados pueden ejercer, con un mayor "span of control" correlacionándose con mayor discreción.

4. **Diseño del Estudio**: Se enfatiza la necesidad de analizar organizaciones con funciones similares para asegurar que las variaciones en el rango de control se traduzcan en diferencias en la discreción.

5. **Conjunto de Datos de Distritos Escolares de Texas**: Se utiliza un conjunto de datos de 670 distritos escolares durante 1994-1997, lo que permite analizar la relación entre estructura organizativa y discreción.

6. **Referencias a Estudios Previos**: Se citan estudios que sugieren que la formación y el contexto profesional influyen en la disposición a ejercer discreción.

El texto también aborda cómo la representación de maestros minoritarios impacta el rendimiento académico de estudiantes de minorías, identificando cuatro formas en que estos maestros pueden influir positivamente en los resultados: actuando como modelos a seguir, tomando decisiones clave, aplicando prácticas disciplinarias equitativas y comprendiendo mejor las necesidades educativas de sus estudiantes.

Se discute la complejidad de la experiencia docente y cómo la formación de los maestros puede influir en su efectividad. Además, se menciona la relación entre la pobreza y el rendimiento académico, sugiriendo que el aprendizaje ocurre tanto en la escuela como en el hogar.

El análisis estadístico revela que la representación de maestros minoritarios tiene un efecto positivo en el rendimiento de estudiantes minoritarios, especialmente en contextos donde los maestros tienen mayor autonomía. Se concluye que las estructuras organizativas que fomentan la discreción son beneficiosas para convertir la representación pasiva en activa, mejorando así el rendimiento académico de los estudiantes de minorías.

Finalmente, el texto enfatiza la importancia de considerar la estructura organizativa en su totalidad para entender cómo la discreción y la representación interactúan en el contexto educativo, sugiriendo que una mayor discreción puede ser clave para abordar las necesidades específicas de poblaciones minoritarias.
