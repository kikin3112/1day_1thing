score was obtained in the aspects  of the 21st century skills training. This result was in accordance with the 21st century skills of  pre-service physics teachers which were still in moderate category. So it is necessary to  develop a model of  laboratory activities design that ca n training and enhancing the 21st century  skills for pre -service physics teachers.    1. Introduction   Higher education should do a big effort to anticipate the fast dynamical changing in education. One of  the way to do it was by adapting the 21st  century learning concept. The concept of 21st century  learning was characterized by training and developing th e 21st century skills , which were life and  carrer skill, learning and innovation skill, and also information, media and te chnology skill. These  skills were  united as a scheme called 21st century knowledge -skills [1] . Physics learning as a part of  science education has a strategic role in developing 21st century education. In physics learning, the  21st century skills could be developed by learning p rocess in the classroom and hands -on lab  activities.    Laboratory activities was an important part in the nature  of science. Hands -on lab activity was the  main activity in laboratory that could not be separated from physics learning. This activity could build  up students motivation and achievement in physics learning, skills developing, based experimenting,  practice  skill developing, and has a role as a learning mode in science metodh application [2]. The  right hands -on lab activity would build and reconstruct knowledge, and strenghten students  comprehension of physics [3]. Furthermore, hands -on lab activity was also  potential to provide higher  order thinking skill s [4]. However, there were many studies that found hands -on lab generally has not

It is happens because of the many limitations and challenges faced in  conducting hands -on lab activities [5].  Several st udies have been conducted to explore the pre -service science teacher ’s responses to  laboratory activities. One study result shows that pre-service science teacher’s view laboratory  activities as indispensable for improving the quality of science learning. Laboratory activities are one  of the tools for visualization, application, observation and experimentation related to the concepts of  science studied [6]. Meanwhile,  other studies show that they feel less comfortable working in  laboratories, many challenges to be faced in conducting laboratory activities  but nevertheless they  realize that laboratory activity can not be separated from science learning. While some of th e other  pre-service science teacher  expressed great pleasure in learning science in the laboratory and it makes  the concepts more reasonable [7].  The information is useful for the development of science learning,  but not enough to describe the pre-service physics  teacher's views on important aspects and challenges  faced in conducting laboratory activities   In this study, a more complete investigation was undertaken to explore the teacher's view of  laboratory activity on motivational aspects , the importance o f hands -on lab activity, laboratory  equipments, hands -on lab process, the suitability with curriculum, hands -on lab assessment, and  hands -on lab activity design. In addition, this study aims to explore the opinion of prospective teachers  related to the pro vision and development of 21st century skills through laboratory activities.  Information regarding pre-service physics teachers ' hands -on lab activity
laboratory activities.  Information regarding pre-service physics teachers ' hands -on lab activity and their 21st century skills  are important to know. This can be a basic model of a design -oriented to develop  21st century skills.  These skills are needed because of the global challenges of the 21st century.   2. Method   This research was a descriptive study to get the description of pre -service physics teachers ’  perceptions toward hands -on lab activity and their 21st century skills in Physics Education Study  Program in one of university  in Bengkulu. The respondent s that involed in this study were 113  students of even semester in 2016/2017  academic y ear who has passed the physics hands -on lab  course. At first, the questionnaire was distributed to 167 even semester students, but only 133 students  (male 52 and female 81, ranging in age  from 19 to 22 years ) who filled and gave the questionnaire  back.   The instrument used for collectin g the data was a questionnaire of students perception towar d  hands -on lab activity and their 21st century skills. The perception scale used 5 level of agreement  which were s trongly disagree, disagree, less agree, agree, and strongly agree . The questionnair e used  in this research has been through the validity and reliability test. The students’ perception data toward  hands -on lab activity divided into four categories, namely miserably , poor, fair, and good . While the  students’  perception data toward 21st century skills was di vided into very low, low, moderate , and  high.   The students’ perception questionnaire toward the hands -on lab activity consisted of 8 perception’s  aspec ts with total 42 questions . Those aspects were hands -on lab motivation, the importance of hands - on lab activity, laboratory equipments, hands -on lab process, the suitability with curriculum, hands -on  lab assessment, hands -on lab activity design, and the 21st century skills’ training. The questionnaire of  stude nts’

Result and Discussion   3.1. Pre-service Teachers ’ Perceptions toward Hands -on Lab Activity   Based on the analysis of questionnaires data, it was found that pre-service teachers ' perceptions o n  hands -on lab activities were in good category for motivation aspect (A -1), the importance of hands -on  lab activity (A -2), and hands -on lab process (A -4). While on the aspect of laboratory equipments (A - 3), suitability with curriculum (A -5), hands -on lab assessment (A -6), hands -on lab design (A -7), and  21st century skills training (A -8), the students’ perception was in fair category. The results of data  analysis is  shown in f igure 1.     Figure 1 . Graph of student s’ perceptions  toward hands -on  lab activity .  The highest score of the perception was obtained in the motivation of hands -on lab activity’s  aspect   that was equal to 4.48, and followed by the importance of hands -on lab  activity ’s aspect with 4,28. In  general, the students stated that they were  happy to do a hands -on lab activity , and hoping that  every  important concept would  be support ed by hands -on lab  activities . They were  challenged in assembling  the laboratory  equipment s, and it was easy to learn physics through hands -on lab  activities. In addition,  the s tudents believe d that hands -on lab  activities c ould improve their concept understanding, train the  skills of applying scientific methods, reduce misconceptions,  help to understand abstract concepts, and  could train a sense of responsibility, honesty and accuracy .  The lowest perception score was obtained in the 21st century skills ’ training
and accuracy .  The lowest perception score was obtained in the 21st century skills ’ training aspect, which was  3.01, and followed by the laboratory  equipment s’ aspect at 3.36. In the aspect of the 21st century skills  training, students stated that the hands -on lab activity  has not been maximized in trained critical  thinking skills, decision -making skills, creative thinking skills, problem -solving strategies, and has not  yet maximized in involving computer technology to access information, analyze data, and present the   results of the experiment . Furthermore , the students stated that the available laboratory  equipment s  were not yet able to be used to explore the abstract a nd microscopic concepts, and it was still not  fulfilled the standards need  for hands -on lab activity .  3.2. Pre-service Teachers ’ Perceptions toward Their  21st Century Skills   The 21st century skills explored were include d the domains of learning and innovation skills (K1), life  and career skills (K2), and media , information and technology skills (K3). Based on questionnaires ’  data analysis , it was  obtained that the results of the 21st century skills of the pre-service teac hers were  in moderate  category with an average score was 3.62. The result of data analysis is shown  in figure 2.   It has seen that 21st century skills domains which were  mostly comprehend by the students were  life  and career skills, and media information and technology skill s. While  the least -owned domain of

Discussion   Hands -on lab  is one of the important activities in physics learning. Through this activity , students can  study physics through a real experience. Students can replicate how scientists study the universe using  the scientific method [3]. For pre-service teacher , hands -on lab  activity was not only help  them  in  constructing and reconstructing the c oncepts of physics, but also as a moderate  to understand the  nature of physics which consists of product and process domains. These experiences may encourage  them to teach  physics in a right way  to the students.  Many benefits of laboratory activity  in learning  physics encourage d researchers to develop the best way of doing hands -on lab activity  [8]. The  development of laboratory  activ ity could be based on the main objectives of the learning, the activity  design, the students’ prior knowledge and exp erience, the contextual phenomenon, and based on the  type of media used. Information related to the perception of pre-service physics teacher toward hands - on lab activities and the ir early profile of 21st century skills becomes important to know. These   information was required as a reference in formulating every aspect s of hands -on lab design which  would be developed.   This research explore d the perception of pre-service physics teacher toward
would be developed.   This research explore d the perception of pre-service physics teacher toward hands -on physics  lab  activit ies and their 21st century skills at a university  in Bengkulu , Indonesia . The result of data  analysis show ed that the students' perception toward hands -on lab  activity that has been done was in  moderate  category. Student perceptions of 21st century skills were  also still in the same category.  If it  was reviewed on every aspect s of student's perception toward hands -on lab activities, it was only the  aspect  of hands -on lab  motivation, the importance of hands -on lab  activities, and the hands -on lab   process which were got good category responses. While the student’s  perception of the other aspects  on hands -on lab activities were in moderate  category. Based on these results , it was known that  general ly students have high motivation in following the hands -on lab activities. Students agree d that  the hands -on lab is an important activity that is very useful in learning physics. Nevertheless, the  results of perceptual data analysis indicate d that the laboratory  equipment s used for hands -on lab  activity were  still not reached minimal  standard o f the subject needs , especially for an abstract and  microscopic concepts. This was reinforced by the statement that the hands -on lab activites  that has  been done was in accordance with the objectives of the curriculum but was not able to reach all the  main  concepts, especially the complex and abstract concept s.  According to the students ’ perception , hands -on lab  activities have been done in a good process,  but still in conventional  way. Conventional for laboratory  activities  were characterized by hands -on  lab procedures that have been prepared in detail on manual  guideline , the unvaried laboratory  model,  the routine problem ’s explored , the assessment focused on the lab report and  exam, and the lack of  ICT technology  used in the lab. The
focused on the lab report and  exam, and the lack of  ICT technology  used in the lab. The results were  based on the data analysis of student s’ perception  which showed  that as many as 60.2% of the students were less agree on the item which stated that  hands -on lab activities  has been done in order to train the problem -solving strategy on the  real proble m  than to verify the theory's truth. This means that the laboratory activity is intended to verify and  reinforce the material already given in the classroom. Explicitly these results indicate that physics lab  activity is generally still done conventionally . This result is consistent with several findings in
6 1234567890International Conference on Mathematics and Science Education (ICMScE)  IOP Publishing IOP Conf. Series: Journal of Physics: Conf. Series 895 (2017) 012015  doi  :10.1088/1742-6596/895/1/012015            previous studies [8]. Conventional laboratory activities generally emphasize motor activity rather than  metacognition [9] so that it is less able to train high -order thinking [10].   Furthermore as many as 63,7% of students  were  less agree on the item that stated hands -on lab   activity begins by giving  contextual problem related to daily life and the  solution will be investigated  through hands -on lab  activity , 67,3% students s tated that they were l ess agree that hands -on lab   activities contain the activities of formulating hypothesis and then testing it through observation test,  measurement, and data analysis which  the procedure was determined by the students themselves, and  as 54,9% student s were less agree to the item which stated that the hands -on lab activity used a various  model . In addition,  as many as 82.3% of the students were less agree  on the item that  said the hands -on  lab assessment was mostly  prioritized on the science process  aspect  rather than the hands -on lab report  and the test, and as many as 62% of students were less agree  on the item which stated that the hands - on lab  activity has conducted to encourage the use of computers to organize  data, analyze data, and  write laboratory repor ts.  The hands -on lab  activity has not been maximal in training and providing 21st century skills. This  result was seen from the score of 21st century skills ’ training aspect through the hands -on lab activity   which was in the lowest order (Figure 1). This f act was in line with the analysis results of the 2 1st  century skills ’ perception questionnaire which show ed that student s 21st century skills were still in the  moderate  category (t able 1, table 2, and table 3). These results were  also in line with
in the  moderate  category (t able 1, table 2, and table 3). These results were  also in line with the previous  research , found  that the critical thinking and scientific reasoning of pre-service physics teacher at a  university in Bengulu  were  at low and moderate  levels  [11].  Based on the explanation  above , it can be summarized into some important points  such as  students  have good motivation in the hands -on lab activity, students stated that the hands -on lab activity  was  very important to do in physics learning, abstract and microscopic concepts c ould not be explored due  to the limitations of laboratory  equipment s, hands -on lab activity  was still done in conventional  way,  the hands -on lab activity  has not maximally provided 21st century skills, and student s 21st century  skills were  still in moderate  category. This result c ould be used as a reference in the develop ment a  model of laboratory  design which  would  be used as an alternative solution to various problems  obtained.   4. Conclusion   Based on the research results and discussion , it can be conclude that  hands -on lab activities that ha s  been done at a university  in Bengkulu were  in fair category. Students g ave the highest perception score  on hands -on lab motivation and the importance of hands -on lab  activity aspect s. While the lowest  score was given to the aspects of students  21st century skills ’ training and laboratory  equipment s. The  21st century skills of pre-service physics teacher at a university in Bengkulu were in moderate   category. The lowest to the highest scores of 21st century skill s was gained on the domains of  learning  and innovati on skills; media, information and technology skills; and life and career skills. The results  of this study indicate d the importance of developing  21st century skills -based  laboratory  design model.

It is happens because of the many limitations and challenges faced in  conducting hands -on lab activities [5].  Several st udies have been conducted to explore the pre -service science teacher ’s responses to  laboratory activities. One study result shows that pre-service science teacher’s view laboratory  activities as indispensable for improving the quality of science learning. Laboratory activities are one  of the tools for visualization, application, observation and experimentation related to the concepts of  science studied [6]. Meanwhile,  other studies show that they feel less comfortable working in  laboratories, many challenges to be faced in conducting laboratory activities  but nevertheless they  realize that laboratory activity can not be separated from science learning. While some of th e other  pre-service science teacher  expressed great pleasure in learning science in the laboratory and it makes  the concepts more reasonable [7].  The information is useful for the development of science learning,  but not enough to describe the pre-service physics  teacher's views on important aspects and challenges  faced in conducting laboratory activities   In this study, a more complete investigation was undertaken to explore the teacher's view of  laboratory activity on motivational aspects , the importance o f hands -on lab activity, laboratory  equipments, hands -on lab process, the suitability with curriculum, hands -on lab assessment, and  hands -on lab activity design. In addition, this study aims to explore the opinion of prospective teachers  related to the pro vision and development of 21st century skills through laboratory activities.  Information regarding pre-service physics teachers ' hands -on lab activity

Result and Discussion   3.1. Pre-service Teachers ’ Perceptions toward Hands -on Lab Activity   Based on the analysis of questionnaires data, it was found that pre-service teachers ' perceptions o n  hands -on lab activities were in good category for motivation aspect (A -1), the importance of hands -on  lab activity (A -2), and hands -on lab process (A -4). While on the aspect of laboratory equipments (A - 3), suitability with curriculum (A -5), hands -on lab assessment (A -6), hands -on lab design (A -7), and  21st century skills training (A -8), the students’ perception was in fair category. The results of data  analysis is  shown in f igure 1.     Figure 1 . Graph of student s’ perceptions  toward hands -on  lab activity .  The highest score of the perception was obtained in the motivation of hands -on lab activity’s  aspect   that was equal to 4.48, and followed by the importance of hands -on lab  activity ’s aspect with 4,28. In  general, the students stated that they were  happy to do a hands -on lab activity , and hoping that  every  important concept would  be support ed by hands -on lab  activities . They were  challenged in assembling  the laboratory  equipment s, and it was easy to learn physics through hands -on lab  activities. In addition,  the s tudents believe d that hands -on lab  activities c ould improve their concept understanding, train the  skills of applying scientific methods, reduce misconceptions,  help to understand abstract concepts, and  could train a sense of responsibility, honesty and accuracy .  The lowest perception score was obtained in the 21st century skills ’ training
and accuracy .  The lowest perception score was obtained in the 21st century skills ’ training aspect, which was  3.01, and followed by the laboratory  equipment s’ aspect at 3.36. In the aspect of the 21st century skills  training, students stated that the hands -on lab activity  has not been maximized in trained critical  thinking skills, decision -making skills, creative thinking skills, problem -solving strategies, and has not  yet maximized in involving computer technology to access information, analyze data, and present the   results of the experiment . Furthermore , the students stated that the available laboratory  equipment s  were not yet able to be used to explore the abstract a nd microscopic concepts, and it was still not  fulfilled the standards need  for hands -on lab activity .  3.2. Pre-service Teachers ’ Perceptions toward Their  21st Century Skills   The 21st century skills explored were include d the domains of learning and innovation skills (K1), life  and career skills (K2), and media , information and technology skills (K3). Based on questionnaires ’  data analysis , it was  obtained that the results of the 21st century skills of the pre-service teac hers were  in moderate  category with an average score was 3.62. The result of data analysis is shown  in figure 2.   It has seen that 21st century skills domains which were  mostly comprehend by the students were  life  and career skills, and media information and technology skill s.

Discussion   Hands -on lab  is one of the important activities in physics learning. Through this activity , students can  study physics through a real experience. Students can replicate how scientists study the universe using  the scientific method [3]. For pre-service teacher , hands -on lab  activity was not only help  them  in  constructing and reconstructing the c oncepts of physics, but also as a moderate  to understand the  nature of physics which consists of product and process domains. These experiences may encourage  them to teach  physics in a right way  to the students.  Many benefits of laboratory activity  in learning  physics encourage d researchers to develop the best way of doing hands -on lab activity  [8]. The  development of laboratory  activ ity could be based on the main objectives of the learning, the activity  design, the students’ prior knowledge and exp erience, the contextual phenomenon, and based on the  type of media used. Information related to the perception of pre-service physics teacher toward hands - on lab activities and the ir early profile of 21st century skills becomes important to know. These   information was required as a reference in formulating every aspect s of hands -on lab design which  would be developed.   This research explore d the perception of pre-service physics teacher toward
would be developed.   This research explore d the perception of pre-service physics teacher toward hands -on physics  lab  activit ies and their 21st century skills at a university  in Bengkulu , Indonesia . The result of data  analysis show ed that the students' perception toward hands -on lab  activity that has been done was in  moderate  category. Student perceptions of 21st century skills were  also still in the same category.  If it  was reviewed on every aspect s of student's perception toward hands -on lab activities, it was only the  aspect  of hands -on lab  motivation, the importance of hands -on lab  activities, and the hands -on lab   process which were got good category responses. While the student’s  perception of the other aspects  on hands -on lab activities were in moderate  category. Based on these results , it was known that  general ly students have high motivation in following the hands -on lab activities. Students agree d that  the hands -on lab is an important activity that is very useful in learning physics. Nevertheless, the  results of perceptual data analysis indicate d that the laboratory  equipment s used for hands -on lab  activity were  still not reached minimal  standard o f the subject needs , especially for an abstract and  microscopic concepts. This was reinforced by the statement that the hands -on lab activites  that has  been done was in accordance with the objectives of the curriculum but was not able to reach all the  main  concepts, especially the complex and abstract concept s.  According to the students ’ perception , hands -on lab  activities have been done in a good process,  but still in conventional  way. Conventional for laboratory  activities  were characterized by hands -on  lab procedures that have been prepared in detail on manual  guideline , the unvaried laboratory  model,  the routine problem ’s explored , the assessment focused on the lab report and  exam, and the lack of  ICT technology  used in the lab. The
focused on the lab report and  exam, and the lack of  ICT technology  used in the lab. The results were  based on the data analysis of student s’ perception  which showed  that as many as 60.2% of the students were less agree on the item which stated that  hands -on lab activities  has been done in order to train the problem -solving strategy on the  real proble m  than to verify the theory's truth. This means that the laboratory activity is intended to verify and  reinforce the material already given in the classroom. Explicitly these results indicate that physics lab  activity is generally still done conventionally . This result is consistent with several findings in
6 1234567890International Conference on Mathematics and Science Education (ICMScE)  IOP Publishing IOP Conf. Series: Journal of Physics: Conf. Series 895 (2017) 012015  doi  :10.1088/1742-6596/895/1/012015            previous studies [8]. Conventional laboratory activities generally emphasize motor activity rather than  metacognition [9] so that it is less able to train high -order thinking [10].   Furthermore as many as 63,7% of students  were  less agree on the item that stated hands -on lab   activity begins by giving  contextual problem related to daily life and the  solution will be investigated  through hands -on lab  activity , 67,3% students s tated that they were l ess agree that hands -on lab   activities contain the activities of formulating hypothesis and then testing it through observation test,  measurement, and data analysis which  the procedure was determined by the students themselves, and  as 54,9% student s were less agree to the item which stated that the hands -on lab activity used a various  model . In addition,  as many as 82.3% of the students were less agree  on the item that  said the hands -on  lab assessment was mostly  prioritized on the science process  aspect  rather than the hands -on lab report  and the test, and as many as 62% of students were less agree  on the item which stated that the hands - on lab  activity has conducted to encourage the use of computers to organize  data, analyze data, and  write laboratory repor ts.  The hands -on lab  activity has not been maximal in training and providing 21st century skills. This  result was seen from the score of 21st century skills ’ training aspect through the hands -on lab activity   which was in the lowest order (Figure 1). This f act was in line with the analysis results of the 2 1st  century skills ’ perception questionnaire which show ed that student s 21st century skills were still in the  moderate  category (t able 1, table 2, and table 3). These results were  also in line with
in the  moderate  category (t able 1, table 2, and table 3). These results were  also in line with the previous  research , found  that the critical thinking and scientific reasoning of pre-service physics teacher at a  university in Bengulu  were  at low and moderate  levels  [11].  Based on the explanation  above , it can be summarized into some important points  such as  students  have good motivation in the hands -on lab activity, students stated that the hands -on lab activity  was  very important to do in physics learning, abstract and microscopic concepts c ould not be explored due  to the limitations of laboratory  equipment s, hands -on lab activity  was still done in conventional  way,  the hands -on lab activity  has not maximally provided 21st century skills, and student s 21st century  skills were  still in moderate  category. This result c ould be used as a reference in the develop ment a  model of laboratory  design which  would  be used as an alternative solution to various problems  obtained.   4. Conclusion   Based on the research results and discussion , it can be conclude that  hands -on lab activities that ha s  been done at a university  in Bengkulu were  in fair category. Students g ave the highest perception score  on hands -on lab motivation and the importance of hands -on lab  activity aspect s. While the lowest  score was given to the aspects of students  21st century skills ’ training and laboratory  equipment s. The  21st century skills of pre-service physics teacher at a university in Bengkulu were in moderate   category. The lowest to the highest scores of 21st century skill s was gained on the domains of  learning  and innovati on skills; media, information and technology skills; and life and career skills. The results  of this study indicate d the importance of developing  21st century skills -based  laboratory  design model.

En el artículo "Pre-Service Physics Teachers’ Perception toward Hands-on Lab Activity and 21st Century Skills" publicado en el Journal of Physics: Conference Series en 2017, los autores D H Putri y otros exploran la percepción de los futuros profesores de física hacia las actividades de laboratorio prácticas y las habilidades del siglo XXI. El estudio se centra en la importancia de las actividades prácticas en el laboratorio y cómo estas contribuyen al desarrollo de habilidades relevantes para el siglo XXI.

El estudio se realizó en la Universidad de Bengkulu, Indonesia, y se encuestó a 113 estudiantes que habían completado un curso de laboratorio. Se exploraron aspectos como la motivación, la importancia de las actividades de laboratorio, el equipo, el proceso de actividades de laboratorio, la idoneidad del plan de estudios, la evaluación, el diseño del laboratorio y la formación en habilidades del siglo XXI. Se dividieron las habilidades del siglo XXI en habilidades de aprendizaje e innovación, habilidades de vida y carrera, y habilidades de medios, información y tecnología.

Los resultados mostraron que los estudiantes tenían una percepción moderada hacia las actividades de laboratorio y las habilidades del siglo XXI. Aunque valoraban la motivación y la importancia de las actividades prácticas en laboratorio, la formación en habilidades del siglo XXI obtuvo una puntuación más baja. Se sugiere desarrollar un modelo de diseño de actividades de laboratorio que mejore las habilidades del siglo XXI de los futuros profesores de física.

El estudio destaca la importancia de mejorar las actividades prácticas en laboratorio para desarrollar habilidades prácticas y de resolución de problemas, así como la integración efectiva de la tecnología en el aula. Se menciona la necesidad de repensar la forma en que se enseña la física en el laboratorio para alinearla con las demandas del siglo XXI. Los resultados del estudio podrían utilizarse como referencia para mejorar el diseño de las actividades prácticas en laboratorio y preparar mejor a los futuros profesores de física para los desafíos educativos actuales.
