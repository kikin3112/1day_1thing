Universities worldwide are adopting entrepreneurship teaching through creating models and  methods. Collaboration of research, industry, and government entities is crucial to fulfill innovative systems in  the academic environment. This study evaluates academic faculty and their impact on entrepreneurial education  by focusing on their work experience, position, involvement in technical projects, international work experience,  and private sector experience. Analysis of Variances (ANOVA), Least Significant Difference (LSD) assessments are  conducted to support the results of our hypotheses and the variables of the entrepreneurial education impact by  understanding the interpersonal aspects of faculty within academic organizations.    1.Introduction  Numerous studies have been prepared on the entrepreneurial uni- versity and higher education institutes offering the traditional education  setting in Europe and the United States that are both in support of  entrepreneurship in academics through developing new models and  missions to better understand this discipline. Educational organizations  are amassing the field of entrepreneurship education through
discipline. Educational organizations  are amassing the field of entrepreneurship education through innovative  programs and incubators to seed students and faculty to incorporate the  entrepreneurial mindset, attitude, and teaching approaches especially in  course offerings. Higher education institutes are studying the develop - ment of entrepreneurship education by detecting gaps through teaching  methods and student ’s attitudes [1]. Academic teaching has shifted from  the traditional methods focusing on faculty with diverse experiences and  entrepreneurial perspectives being a crucial entity to the effectiveness of  entrepreneurship education.  Goldstein compared the United States and the European Union universities with results of the transformative attitudes of the faculty  and that mutual regions are adapting to the emerging field of entre - preneurship education missions and needs [8]. Cooperation of univer - sities and industry gives new insight and produces new programs and  positions in many regions. Government has played an enormous role  with the association of education by sustaining research and grants to  support the entrepreneurship ecosystem that will benefit the develop - ment of the academic environment.  In 2012, the National Science Foundation (NSF) launched the NSF I-  Corps (TM) program that offered universities funding and exposed them  to innovative and entrepreneurial curriculum across the country [4,5].  Ahmad et all. 2018, surveyed fifteen academics from public and private  universities in Malaysia who encouraged their students through entre - preneurship activities. The result pointed to the fact that public uni- versities are more affiliated with the government in terms of funding,  structure, and policy that makes them more favorable towards entre - preneurship development than private universities [6]. University,  ☆The results also demonstrate that there is a significant difference between participants ’ work position in agreement
that there is a significant difference between participants ’ work position in agreement of “our department is given significant  latitude when evaluating faculty members ’ performance ” (F =2.65, df =4, 106, p <0.05). The post hoc comparisons show that associate participants significantly  agreed on this statement more than assistant, instructors, and full-time professor participants. Furthermore, there is a significant difference between the groups of  participants ’ work position in participants ’ agreement of the statement that “the performance review of our faculty members includes off-campus activities in  addition to research, teaching, and service to the university ” (F =2.57, df =4, 102, p <0.05). The post hoc comparisons show that participants in the associate level  participants significantly agreed on this statement more than assistant participants.  *Corresponding author.

This study aims at investigating faculty perceptions toward the  entrepreneurial university by focusing on the attributes of work expe- rience, work position, involvement in technical projects, international  work experience, and private sector experience. The current literature  covers partial facets of faculty attitudes of the entrepreneurial university  and contains limited aspects. The study at hand adds value with several  characteristics contributing to a larger sample size of diverse  participants.  2.Literature review  2.1. Entrepreneurship models  The European Union’s Project Aspire, which lasted four years and  involved faculty and students in entrepreneurial teaching from twelve  universities and eight countries, revealed that the project’s outcomes  included cross-institutional building, innovative curriculum design, and  the creation of a structure for ongoing collaboration and cooperation in  research, learning, and teaching strategies [7]. A study of 3037 students  and faculty on perceptions of entrepreneurship education motives and  barriers across six countries (USA, China, India, Turkey, Belgium, and  Spain) with widely varying cultures, economies, and backgrounds  resulted in students seeing themselves as more entrepreneurial than the  faculty identifies them [3].  An innovative academic entrepreneurship model in China has stim- ulated academic entrepreneurs and technology transfer within industry  collaboration demonstrating a new avenue for the efficient transfer of  technological advances from academic research to the commercial  market, generating both social and economic value, and supports  regional economic growth [9]. The Quadruple Helix Model is an inno- vative cooperation of collaborators involved from industry, research,  and government by identifying challenges associated
involved from industry, research,  and government by identifying challenges associated with the entre - preneurship university based on knowledge management [10]. Industry,  government, and university collaboration are for the advancement of  innovation, technology transfer, knowledge management, and  commercialization. Educational researchers are the key individuals in  academic commercialization of products and services [11].  The Taiwan government in higher education has supported univer - sity and industry collaboration (UIC) with the results that faculty ties in  the industry to promote entrepreneurial education have a greater impact  based on their work experience, position, age, gender, academic status,  awards, and social ties [12]. Russia is focusing on education, the field of  science, and innovative technologies by learning from past experiences  of neighboring eastern countries such as Japan and India [13]. These  studies display the benefits and advantages of international collabora - tion between universities and supports the development of academic  entrepreneurship. By focusing on students as change agents, higher  education institutions can make the most of their position within a  community by creating social entrepreneurship education programs that  could foster a cataract of improved cooperation, economic growth, po- litical capital, and social good in the ecosystem [14].  2.2. Entrepreneurship university  The entrepreneurial university is a new concept, and is gaining  attention and traction from scholarly professionals to develop in com- parison to other management and business disciplines [2]. Academic  entrepreneurship and economic growth are interconnected and univer - sities are educating faculty for academia and industry collaboration in  science and technology projects [15]. In 2011, Stanford University made  assessments of nearly 40,000 corporations their alumni have formed  from one entity would be one of the world’s largest economies
their alumni have formed  from one entity would be one of the world’s largest economies as the  alumni have created 5.4 million jobs and annual world revenues of $2.7  trillion [16]. Illinois Tech lists entrepreneurship education as a core value in its mission and the structure provided uses key external com- munity members to connect university projects to the regional entre - preneurship ecosystem to have collaboration and support of young  entrepreneurs [17].  Many factors discussing entrepreneurial education and the faculty  play a vital role in student’s interpretations of entrepreneurship. A  survey in Spain of eighty-four deans and directors established an inno- vative maturity model that offers guidelines for universities to follow as  they advance in their development stages and model the characteristics  of the entrepreneurial university that they may apply [18]. The Poly- technic College of Donostia-San Sebastian (UPV-EHU), the School of  Engineering Tecnun (University of Navarra), and the Faculty of Engi- neering at Mondragon University developed Project UNEK, an entre - preneurial management model presenting an academic management  maturity model for the technological faculties that are decision-makers  in their organizations in order to gain perspective on the entrepreneurial  activities taking residence within a systematic framework throughout  Europe [19,20]. Entrepreneurship temperament and character of faculty  in higher education institutes of Turkey influence entrepreneur in- tentions of students [21].  A cross country study covering forty European countries with diverse  income and education levels have reached the result by means of data  that show the difference between male and female led employers and  self-employment with similar and varying barriers across the countries  [22]. There has been an increase of research in STEM focusing on the  advancement of entrepreneur education and data from the Global  Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) of
advancement of entrepreneur education and data from the Global  Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) of nineteen European countries and  the USA., The research results indicate that countries with gender  equality have a much higher entrepreneurial presence [23]. Based on  the World Bank data on education enrollment, gender gaps have been  reducing at a tremendous level globally leading to improved economic  growth and performance [24]. Micozzi and Lucarelli analyzed  thirty-seven nations between the years of 2001 and 2012 using GEM  data resulting in gender and individuality along with social, economic,  and country variations impacting entrepreneurship ability across all the  countries [25].  The Institute of Higher Education (IPT) in Malaysia encourages  entrepreneurial programs in higher academic institutions. The main  objective is to promote and generate business interests and ideas among  students [26]. Industry private experience is invaluable. A quantitative  study was conducted in Malaysia, which included ninety lecturers of  engineering courses who all have similar student-centered teaching  methods. The results indicated that teaching soft skills in technical  courses is important, and showed that lecturers with private industry  experience perceive that entrepreneur and management skills are of  high importance compared to the group with no industry experience  [27]. European business schools develop most of the innovative skills  through merging lectures and active entrepreneurial methods and by  combining the “about entrepreneurship” attitude with the “for entre - preneurship” understanding [28,29]. Faculty is significantly supportive  of their universities assisting regional economic development [8].  The entrepreneurial university has been researched and studied for  years., There is a profusion of sources, but there is still a lack of models  of generalized entrepreneurship education process [30]. Sixty-eight  senior-level educationists of three
entrepreneurship education process [30]. Sixty-eight  senior-level educationists of three universities in India identified a  poor entrepreneurial ecosystem, the need of specialized entrepreneur - ship faculty, and ineffective teaching methodology [31]. Literature is  limited on the specific challenges and obstacles faced by administrators,  faculty and departments in fulfilling entrepreneurship education, and  few studies recommend changes that require to be implemented in  higher education institutions to support the mission of entrepreneurship  development [32].  Much of the background is based on prior studies and can be  reviewed there [33–36]. C. Ozen et al.
Technology in Society 72 (2023) 102168 32.3. Hypotheses  Based on the above discussion we formulate the following  hypotheses:  H1 Faculty with developed work experience have more of a signifi - cant impact on entrepreneurial education.  H2 Faculty with established work position have more of a significant  impact on entrepreneurial education.  H3 Faculty with technical projects have more of a significant impact  on entrepreneurial education.  H4 Faculty with international experience have more of a significant  impact on entrepreneurial education.  H5 Faculty with private sector experience have more of a significant  impact on entrepreneurial education.  3.Methodology  The web of science has been employed for the literature review on  the entrepreneurship university. The key terms in the search are entre - preneurship university, academic entrepreneurship, and entrepreneur - ship education. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a collection of  statistical models used to analyze differences between group means.  Fishers Least Significant Difference (LSD) method is utilized within the  framework of ANOVA to identify the specific group means differences. A  survey questionnaire has been sent to participants for data collection.  The demographics of the participants ’ work experience are entry level  with (1–3) years, associate level with (4–8) years, senior level with  (9–14) years, and executive level with (15+) years of work experience in  the academic entrepreneurship ecosystem. (Tables 3–5)  The positions of the participants are assistant, instructor, associate,  and full-time professor. The online survey has been sent to sixty-one  participants who have contributed to this study. The surveyed have  been project team leaders and grant holders of national or international  projects in the past ten years. Also, the targeted participants have spe- cific criteria such as international experience, working at a university or  scientific institute within a firm, and being a
experience, working at a university or  scientific institute within a firm, and being a grant holder of scientific  projects in Croatia or the European Union.  Independent sample t-tests were conducted with the faculty partic - ipants, which have been applied to the categories of having an inter- national scientific project in last five years, spending more than six  months abroad engaged in scientific work, spent time working abroad,  and private sector experience. ANOVA and LSD are utilized for the  significance of data analyzed and the variances between the sets of data  leading to the hypotheses of this study. The threshold applied to eval- uate the participants ’ assessment of the significant factors in support of  the entrepreneurial university is less than >0.05 has been accepted. To  test the following findings, ANOVA and LSD comparisons are conducted  to investigate these differences further.  4.Results and discussion  4.1. ANOVA results on Faculty Experience  The findings indicate there is a significant difference between the  participants ’ work experience leading to our participants evaluating  “entrepreneurship courses of students ” as a requirement to contribute to universities becoming entrepreneurial responsive (F =4.77, df =3, 108,  p <0.01). The post hoc comparisons exhibited associate, senior, and  executive level participants significantly evaluate that course in entre - preneurship contributes to the awareness of the university considerably  than entry-level participants (See Table 1and Fig. 1) (see Table 2).  The findings illustrate there is a significant difference between the  groups of participants ’ work experiences on evaluating “state funding/  dependency on the state ” (F =3.26, df =3, 104, p <0.05) and “inad- equate cultural values ” (F =3.80, df =3, 104, p <0.05) as barriers for  universities to being entrepreneurially responsive. The post hoc com- parisons present the senior and executive participants significantly  evaluated
The post hoc com- parisons present the senior and executive participants significantly  evaluated cultural and government challenges as barriers more than  entry-level participants. Also, the findings demonstrate there is a sig- nificant difference between the groups of participants ’ work experience  on the participants ’ agreement of the statement that “faculty members in  our department emphasize applied research ” (F =2.73, df =3, 105, p < 0.05). The post hoc comparisons show that executive faculty signifi - cantly agreed on this statement more than entry, associate, and senior  levels. Table 1  Participants work experience.

The post hoc comparisons show executive  participants significantly agreed on this statement more than entry,  associate, and senior participants. The findings also demonstrate there is  a significant difference between the groups of participants ’ work expe- rience on the agreement of the statement that “we give faculty members  significant freedom to pursue their career goals ” (F =5.53, df =3, 107,  p <0.01). The post hoc comparisons show that executive participants  significantly agreed on this statement more than entry, associate, and  senior participants. Therefore, H1 is supported as faculty with developed  work experience have an impact on entrepreneurship education. 4.2. ANOVA results on Faculty Position  The findings present a significant difference between the groups of  participants ’ work positions leading to our participants evaluating  “entrepreneurship courses of students ” as a requirement to make uni- versities more entrepreneurial (F =3.25, df =4, 106, p <0.05). The post  hoc comparisons indicate that associate and full-time participants  significantly evaluate this item as a requirement more than assistant and  instructor participants. Moreover, there is a significant difference be- tween the groups work positions on evaluating “traditional values ” as a  requirement to make universities more entrepreneurial (F =2.64, df = 4, 105, p <0.05). The post hoc comparisons reveal that participants ’  groups significantly evaluate this item as a requirement more than any  other position group.

The findings also illustrated that there is a significant difference  between the groups work positions on evaluating “state funding/de - pendency on the state ” (F =2.84, df =4, 105, p <0.05) as a barrier for  universities being entrepreneurial. The post hoc comparisons show that  instructors significantly evaluated these items as barriers more than  assistant professors. In addition, there is a significant difference between  the groups of participants ’ work position on evaluating “lack of physical  resources ” (F =3.42, df =4, 105, p <0.05) as a barrier for universities  being entrepreneurial. The post hoc assessments show that instructors  and full-time faculty in the other group significantly evaluated these  items as barriers more than assistant and associate faculty. Participants  in the other group significantly evaluated these items as barriers more  than associate participants. In addition, there is a significant difference  between the various groups of participants ’ work positions on evalu - ating “clash with research objectives ” (F =6.32, df =4, 105, p =0.000)  as a barrier for universities being entrepreneurially responsive.

Additionally, the instructors and full-time participants  significantly evaluated these items as barriers more than assistant par- ticipants. Furthermore, there is a significant difference between the  groups of participants ’ work positions on evaluating “inadequate cul- tural values ” (F =6.45, df =4, 105, p =0.000) as a barrier for uni- versities being entrepreneurial. The post hoc comparisons showed that  participants in all groups significantly evaluated this item as a barrier  more than assistant participants.  Moreover, there is a significant difference between the groups of  participants ’ work positions on participants ’ agreement of the statement  that “our university has a department or group dedicated to industry/  university liaison activities ” (F =2.56, df =4, 106, p <0.05). The post  hoc comparisons show that participants in the full-time and associate  groups significantly agreed on this statement more than assistant and  instructor participants. In addition, there is a significant difference be- tween the groups of participants ’ work positions on participants ’  agreement of the statement that “we give faculty members significant  freedom to pursue their career goals ” (F =3.49, df =4, 105, p <0.05).  The post hoc comparisons show that participants in the associate and  full-time faculty participants significantly agreed on this statement more  than assistant participant. Therefore, H2 is supported as faculty with  established work position have a significant impact on entrepreneurship  education.  4.3. T-test results on technical projects  The study tested whether participants ’ responses differ if they have  an international scientific project in the last five years. To test this, in- dependent sample t-tests were conducted. Significant t-test results for
years. To test this, in- dependent sample t-tests were conducted. Significant t-test results for  participants ’ responses on having an international scientific project in  last five years are given in the following table. As it is illustrated in the  table, participants with such an experience evaluated “entrepreneurship  courses for staff ” as a requirement to make universities more entrepre - neurial with a higher mean compared to the participants without such  an experience. These participants also evaluated “entrepreneurship role  models ” as a requirement to make universities more entrepreneurial  with a higher mean compared to the participants without such an  experience. Furthermore, these participants evaluated “lack of experi - ence ” as a barrier for universities to be entrepreneurial with a higher  mean compared to the participants without such an experience.  Moreover, these participants evaluated “lack of funding ” as a barrier  for universities to be entrepreneurial with a higher mean compared to  the participants without such an experience. Additionally, these par- ticipants evaluated “traditional values ” as a barrier for universities to be  entrepreneurial with a higher mean compared to the participants  without such an experience. These participants also agreed with a higher  mean that compared to other similar departments in their regions, their  department has a reputation for its contribution to industry and society  compared to the participants without such an experience. Moreover,  these participants agreed with a higher mean that they try to generate  off-campus benefits from research projects compared to the participants  without such an experience.  The study also tested whether participants ’ response on questions  differ if they have ever spent more than six months abroad engaged in  scientific work. To test this, independent sample t-tests were conducted.  Significant t-test results for participants ’ responses on having such an
t-tests were conducted.  Significant t-test results for participants ’ responses on having such an  experience are given in the following table. As it is illustrated in the  table, participants with such an experience revealed that they support  the entrepreneurial university concept more than the participants  without such an experience. On the other hand, participants without  such an experience evaluated “favorable staff attitudes to entrepre - neurship ” as a requirement to make universities more entrepreneurial  with a higher mean compared to the participants with such an  experience. Participants without such an experience evaluated “traditional ways  of teaching ” as a barrier for universities to be entrepreneurial with a  higher mean compared to the participants with such an experience. The  participants with such an experience also agreed with a higher mean on  the statement that their university polices are best described as devel - oped “bottom-up ” using feedback from all levels of the university  compared to the participants without such an experience. Participants  without such an experience also agreed with a higher mean on the  statements that they do not encourage industry involvement in their  graduate student training and their faculty members rarely set up their  own companies or professional practices compared to the participants  with such an experience. Therefore, H3 is supported as faculty with  technical projects have more of a significant impact on entrepreneurship  education.  4.4. T-test results on international experience  The study tested whether participants ’ responses on some questions  differ if they have a preference to spend time working abroad. To test  this, independent sample t-tests were conducted. The study also tested  whether participants ’ responses on some questions differ if they prefer  to spend time working abroad are given in the following table. As it is  illustrated in the table, participants without such a
are given in the following table. As it is  illustrated in the table, participants without such a preference believe  that some faculties are more suitable to create their own income  compared to the participants with such a preference. Furthermore,  participants with such a preference evaluated “flexible organizational  structure ” as a requirement to make universities more entrepreneurial  with a higher mean compared to the participants without such a  preference.  Furthermore, participants without such a preference evaluated “lack  of physical resources ” as a barrier for universities to be entrepreneurial  with a higher mean compared to the participants with such a preference.  Moreover, the participants with such a preference also agreed with a  higher mean on the statements that they encourage their graduate stu- dents to engage in research with significant implications for industry or  society, many of their faculty members conduct research in partnership  with non-academic professionals, cooperation with organizations  outside the university significantly improves their research activities,  their faculty members often seek research opportunities outside the  traditional university environment, their faculty members feel they  benefit financially from their research efforts (in addition to their uni- versity salary) and their university rewards faculty members for their  entrepreneurial attempts compared to the participants without such a  preference. Therefore, H4 is supported as faculty with international  experience have more of a significant impact on entrepreneurial  education.  4.5. T-test results on private experience  The study also tested whether participants ’ responses on some  questions differ if they worked in the private sector. To test this, inde- pendent sample t-tests were conducted. Significant t-test results for  participants ’ responses on having such an experience are given in the  following table. As it is illustrated in the table,
on having such an experience are given in the  following table. As it is illustrated in the table, participants without such  an experience evaluated “entrepreneurship role models ” as a require - ment to make universities more entrepreneurial with a higher mean  compared to the participants with such an experience.  These participants evaluated “state funding/dependency on the  state ” and “clash with teaching objectives ” as barriers for universities to  be entrepreneurial with a higher mean compared to the participants  with such an experience. In addition, these participants agreed with a  higher mean on the statements that in the last three years, they have  made major changes to their course offerings and curriculum and their  university rewards faculty members for their entrepreneurial attempts  compared to the participants without such an experience. Therefore, H5  is supported as faculty with private sector experience have more of a C. Ozen et al.

Faculty of diverse work experiences and positions have been  surveyed on entrepreneurship in the academic environment. Our anal- ysis reveals that the hypotheses in the study are supported with faculty  that have developed work experience and established work positions  having more of a significant impact on entrepreneurial education than  faculty without. Also, faculty with technical projects have more of a  significant impact on entrepreneurial instruction. Furthermore, faculty  with international and private sector experience have more of a signif - icant impact bringing personal knowledge to entrepreneurial education.  The evaluation of faculty members most significant variables  contributing to entrepreneurship education includes review of off-  campus activities. These activities comprise research, teaching,  external service to the university, and freedom to pursue their goals in  teaching methods of entrepreneurship courses of students. Also, faculty  members agreed on several factors such as their universities evaluating  faculty members ’ performance of entrepreneurship teaching, and have a  department or group dedicated to industry/university liaison activities  making collaboration tangible. Other factors faculty members agreed  upon are favorable faculty attitudes towards entrepreneurship, role  models to follow, and to steer away from traditional teaching methods  and embrace new approaches to better students ’ experience and  perspective on academic entrepreneurship.  The comparisons present the senior and executive participants  significantly evaluated cultural and government challenges as barriers  more than entry-level faculty.
evaluated cultural and government challenges as barriers  more than entry-level faculty. The assessments display that instructors  and full-time faculty significantly evaluated lack of physical resources,  university experience, clash with teaching objectives, and traditional  values as barriers more than assistant and associate faculty. The analysis  demonstrates that academic leaders can formulate incentives in teaching  when having individual awareness demonstrating the perceptions of  faculty and their attitudes toward entrepreneurship education in global  edification.  Entrepreneurship in university education is an innovative topic, and  the collective results are influential. Several models have been intro- duced and applied to the knowledge of the entrepreneurial university.  The models accessible are more tailored to the explicit university needs.  Challenges face entrepreneurship education. Various factors such as  negative attitudes and lack of support limit the progression of these  studies attempting to brand universities more entrepreneurial. There are  limited studies of international collaboration, but the few that exist  display valuable and industrious outcomes. Alongside teaching and  research, entrepreneurship awareness in the educational setting is  emerging and developing for students and faculty worldwide. The  interactive collaboration between university, industry, and government  will improve the world economies through the development and growth  of the entrepreneurship ecosystem in the academic environment for  generations to come.

Universities worldwide are adopting entrepreneurship teaching through creating models and  methods. Collaboration of research, industry, and government entities is crucial to fulfill innovative systems in  the academic environment. This study evaluates academic faculty and their impact on entrepreneurial education  by focusing on their work experience, position, involvement in technical projects, international work experience,  and private sector experience. Analysis of Variances (ANOVA), Least Significant Difference (LSD) assessments are  conducted to support the results of our hypotheses and the variables of the entrepreneurial education impact by  understanding the interpersonal aspects of faculty within academic organizations.    1.Introduction  Numerous studies have been prepared on the entrepreneurial uni- versity and higher education institutes offering the traditional education  setting in Europe and the United States that are both in support of  entrepreneurship in academics through developing new models and  missions to better understand this discipline. Educational organizations  are amassing the field of entrepreneurship education through
discipline. Educational organizations  are amassing the field of entrepreneurship education through innovative  programs and incubators to seed students and faculty to incorporate the  entrepreneurial mindset, attitude, and teaching approaches especially in  course offerings. Higher education institutes are studying the develop - ment of entrepreneurship education by detecting gaps through teaching  methods and student ’s attitudes [1]. Academic teaching has shifted from  the traditional methods focusing on faculty with diverse experiences and  entrepreneurial perspectives being a crucial entity to the effectiveness of  entrepreneurship education.  Goldstein compared the United States and the European Union universities with results of the transformative attitudes of the faculty  and that mutual regions are adapting to the emerging field of entre - preneurship education missions and needs [8]. Cooperation of univer - sities and industry gives new insight and produces new programs and  positions in many regions. Government has played an enormous role  with the association of education by sustaining research and grants to  support the entrepreneurship ecosystem that will benefit the develop - ment of the academic environment.  In 2012, the National Science Foundation (NSF) launched the NSF I-  Corps (TM) program that offered universities funding and exposed them  to innovative and entrepreneurial curriculum across the country [4,5].  Ahmad et all. 2018, surveyed fifteen academics from public and private  universities in Malaysia who encouraged their students through entre - preneurship activities. The result pointed to the fact that public uni- versities are more affiliated with the government in terms of funding,  structure, and policy that makes them more favorable towards entre - preneurship development than private universities [6]. University,  ☆The results also demonstrate that there is a significant difference between participants ’ work position in agreement
that there is a significant difference between participants ’ work position in agreement of “our department is given significant  latitude when evaluating faculty members ’ performance ” (F =2.65, df =4, 106, p <0.05). The post hoc comparisons show that associate participants significantly  agreed on this statement more than assistant, instructors, and full-time professor participants. Furthermore, there is a significant difference between the groups of  participants ’ work position in participants ’ agreement of the statement that “the performance review of our faculty members includes off-campus activities in  addition to research, teaching, and service to the university ” (F =2.57, df =4, 102, p <0.05). The post hoc comparisons show that participants in the associate level  participants significantly agreed on this statement more than assistant participants.  *Corresponding author.

This study aims at investigating faculty perceptions toward the  entrepreneurial university by focusing on the attributes of work expe- rience, work position, involvement in technical projects, international  work experience, and private sector experience. The current literature  covers partial facets of faculty attitudes of the entrepreneurial university  and contains limited aspects. The study at hand adds value with several  characteristics contributing to a larger sample size of diverse  participants.  2.Literature review  2.1. Entrepreneurship models  The European Union’s Project Aspire, which lasted four years and  involved faculty and students in entrepreneurial teaching from twelve  universities and eight countries, revealed that the project’s outcomes  included cross-institutional building, innovative curriculum design, and  the creation of a structure for ongoing collaboration and cooperation in  research, learning, and teaching strategies [7]. A study of 3037 students  and faculty on perceptions of entrepreneurship education motives and  barriers across six countries (USA, China, India, Turkey, Belgium, and  Spain) with widely varying cultures, economies, and backgrounds  resulted in students seeing themselves as more entrepreneurial than the  faculty identifies them [3].  An innovative academic entrepreneurship model in China has stim- ulated academic entrepreneurs and technology transfer within industry  collaboration demonstrating a new avenue for the efficient transfer of  technological advances from academic research to the commercial  market, generating both social and economic value, and supports  regional economic growth [9]. The Quadruple Helix Model is an inno- vative cooperation of collaborators involved from industry, research,  and government by identifying challenges associated
involved from industry, research,  and government by identifying challenges associated with the entre - preneurship university based on knowledge management [10]. Industry,  government, and university collaboration are for the advancement of  innovation, technology transfer, knowledge management, and  commercialization. Educational researchers are the key individuals in  academic commercialization of products and services [11].  The Taiwan government in higher education has supported univer - sity and industry collaboration (UIC) with the results that faculty ties in  the industry to promote entrepreneurial education have a greater impact  based on their work experience, position, age, gender, academic status,  awards, and social ties [12]. Russia is focusing on education, the field of  science, and innovative technologies by learning from past experiences  of neighboring eastern countries such as Japan and India [13]. These  studies display the benefits and advantages of international collabora - tion between universities and supports the development of academic  entrepreneurship. By focusing on students as change agents, higher  education institutions can make the most of their position within a  community by creating social entrepreneurship education programs that  could foster a cataract of improved cooperation, economic growth, po- litical capital, and social good in the ecosystem [14].  2.2. Entrepreneurship university  The entrepreneurial university is a new concept, and is gaining  attention and traction from scholarly professionals to develop in com- parison to other management and business disciplines [2]. Academic  entrepreneurship and economic growth are interconnected and univer - sities are educating faculty for academia and industry collaboration in  science and technology projects [15]. In 2011, Stanford University made  assessments of nearly 40,000 corporations their alumni have formed  from one entity would be one of the world’s largest economies
their alumni have formed  from one entity would be one of the world’s largest economies as the  alumni have created 5.4 million jobs and annual world revenues of $2.7  trillion [16]. Illinois Tech lists entrepreneurship education as a core value in its mission and the structure provided uses key external com- munity members to connect university projects to the regional entre - preneurship ecosystem to have collaboration and support of young  entrepreneurs [17].  Many factors discussing entrepreneurial education and the faculty  play a vital role in student’s interpretations of entrepreneurship. A  survey in Spain of eighty-four deans and directors established an inno- vative maturity model that offers guidelines for universities to follow as  they advance in their development stages and model the characteristics  of the entrepreneurial university that they may apply [18]. The Poly- technic College of Donostia-San Sebastian (UPV-EHU), the School of  Engineering Tecnun (University of Navarra), and the Faculty of Engi- neering at Mondragon University developed Project UNEK, an entre - preneurial management model presenting an academic management  maturity model for the technological faculties that are decision-makers  in their organizations in order to gain perspective on the entrepreneurial  activities taking residence within a systematic framework throughout  Europe [19,20]. Entrepreneurship temperament and character of faculty  in higher education institutes of Turkey influence entrepreneur in- tentions of students [21].  A cross country study covering forty European countries with diverse  income and education levels have reached the result by means of data  that show the difference between male and female led employers and  self-employment with similar and varying barriers across the countries  [22]. There has been an increase of research in STEM focusing on the  advancement of entrepreneur education and data from the Global  Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) of
advancement of entrepreneur education and data from the Global  Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) of nineteen European countries and  the USA., The research results indicate that countries with gender  equality have a much higher entrepreneurial presence [23]. Based on  the World Bank data on education enrollment, gender gaps have been  reducing at a tremendous level globally leading to improved economic  growth and performance [24]. Micozzi and Lucarelli analyzed  thirty-seven nations between the years of 2001 and 2012 using GEM  data resulting in gender and individuality along with social, economic,  and country variations impacting entrepreneurship ability across all the  countries [25].  The Institute of Higher Education (IPT) in Malaysia encourages  entrepreneurial programs in higher academic institutions. The main  objective is to promote and generate business interests and ideas among  students [26]. Industry private experience is invaluable. A quantitative  study was conducted in Malaysia, which included ninety lecturers of  engineering courses who all have similar student-centered teaching  methods. The results indicated that teaching soft skills in technical  courses is important, and showed that lecturers with private industry  experience perceive that entrepreneur and management skills are of  high importance compared to the group with no industry experience  [27]. European business schools develop most of the innovative skills  through merging lectures and active entrepreneurial methods and by  combining the “about entrepreneurship” attitude with the “for entre - preneurship” understanding [28,29]. Faculty is significantly supportive  of their universities assisting regional economic development [8].  The entrepreneurial university has been researched and studied for  years., There is a profusion of sources, but there is still a lack of models  of generalized entrepreneurship education process [30]. Sixty-eight  senior-level educationists of three
entrepreneurship education process [30]. Sixty-eight  senior-level educationists of three universities in India identified a  poor entrepreneurial ecosystem, the need of specialized entrepreneur - ship faculty, and ineffective teaching methodology [31]. Literature is  limited on the specific challenges and obstacles faced by administrators,  faculty and departments in fulfilling entrepreneurship education, and  few studies recommend changes that require to be implemented in  higher education institutions to support the mission of entrepreneurship  development [32].  Much of the background is based on prior studies and can be  reviewed there [33–36]. C. Ozen et al.
Technology in Society 72 (2023) 102168 32.3. Hypotheses  Based on the above discussion we formulate the following  hypotheses:  H1 Faculty with developed work experience have more of a signifi - cant impact on entrepreneurial education.  H2 Faculty with established work position have more of a significant  impact on entrepreneurial education.  H3 Faculty with technical projects have more of a significant impact  on entrepreneurial education.  H4 Faculty with international experience have more of a significant  impact on entrepreneurial education.  H5 Faculty with private sector experience have more of a significant  impact on entrepreneurial education.  3.Methodology  The web of science has been employed for the literature review on  the entrepreneurship university. The key terms in the search are entre - preneurship university, academic entrepreneurship, and entrepreneur - ship education. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a collection of  statistical models used to analyze differences between group means.  Fishers Least Significant Difference (LSD) method is utilized within the  framework of ANOVA to identify the specific group means differences. A  survey questionnaire has been sent to participants for data collection.  The demographics of the participants ’ work experience are entry level  with (1–3) years, associate level with (4–8) years, senior level with  (9–14) years, and executive level with (15+) years of work experience in  the academic entrepreneurship ecosystem. (Tables 3–5)  The positions of the participants are assistant, instructor, associate,  and full-time professor. The online survey has been sent to sixty-one  participants who have contributed to this study. The surveyed have  been project team leaders and grant holders of national or international  projects in the past ten years. Also, the targeted participants have spe- cific criteria such as international experience, working at a university or  scientific institute within a firm, and being a
experience, working at a university or  scientific institute within a firm, and being a grant holder of scientific  projects in Croatia or the European Union.  Independent sample t-tests were conducted with the faculty partic - ipants, which have been applied to the categories of having an inter- national scientific project in last five years, spending more than six  months abroad engaged in scientific work, spent time working abroad,  and private sector experience. ANOVA and LSD are utilized for the  significance of data analyzed and the variances between the sets of data  leading to the hypotheses of this study. The threshold applied to eval- uate the participants ’ assessment of the significant factors in support of  the entrepreneurial university is less than >0.05 has been accepted. To  test the following findings, ANOVA and LSD comparisons are conducted  to investigate these differences further.  4.Results and discussion  4.1. ANOVA results on Faculty Experience  The findings indicate there is a significant difference between the  participants ’ work experience leading to our participants evaluating  “entrepreneurship courses of students ” as a requirement to contribute to universities becoming entrepreneurial responsive (F =4.77, df =3, 108,  p <0.01). The post hoc comparisons exhibited associate, senior, and  executive level participants significantly evaluate that course in entre - preneurship contributes to the awareness of the university considerably  than entry-level participants (See Table 1and Fig. 1) (see Table 2).  The findings illustrate there is a significant difference between the  groups of participants ’ work experiences on evaluating “state funding/  dependency on the state ” (F =3.26, df =3, 104, p <0.05) and “inad- equate cultural values ” (F =3.80, df =3, 104, p <0.05) as barriers for  universities to being entrepreneurially responsive. The post hoc com- parisons present the senior and executive participants significantly  evaluated
The post hoc com- parisons present the senior and executive participants significantly  evaluated cultural and government challenges as barriers more than  entry-level participants. Also, the findings demonstrate there is a sig- nificant difference between the groups of participants ’ work experience  on the participants ’ agreement of the statement that “faculty members in  our department emphasize applied research ” (F =2.73, df =3, 105, p < 0.05).

The post hoc comparisons show executive  participants significantly agreed on this statement more than entry,  associate, and senior participants. The findings also demonstrate there is  a significant difference between the groups of participants ’ work expe- rience on the agreement of the statement that “we give faculty members  significant freedom to pursue their career goals ” (F =5.53, df =3, 107,  p <0.01). The post hoc comparisons show that executive participants  significantly agreed on this statement more than entry, associate, and  senior participants. Therefore, H1 is supported as faculty with developed  work experience have an impact on entrepreneurship education. 4.2. ANOVA results on Faculty Position  The findings present a significant difference between the groups of  participants ’ work positions leading to our participants evaluating  “entrepreneurship courses of students ” as a requirement to make uni- versities more entrepreneurial (F =3.25, df =4, 106, p <0.05). The post  hoc comparisons indicate that associate and full-time participants  significantly evaluate this item as a requirement more than assistant and  instructor participants. Moreover, there is a significant difference be- tween the groups work positions on evaluating “traditional values ” as a  requirement to make universities more entrepreneurial (F =2.64, df = 4, 105, p <0.05). The post hoc comparisons reveal that participants ’  groups significantly evaluate this item as a requirement more than any  other position group.

The findings also illustrated that there is a significant difference  between the groups work positions on evaluating “state funding/de - pendency on the state ” (F =2.84, df =4, 105, p <0.05) as a barrier for  universities being entrepreneurial. The post hoc comparisons show that  instructors significantly evaluated these items as barriers more than  assistant professors. In addition, there is a significant difference between  the groups of participants ’ work position on evaluating “lack of physical  resources ” (F =3.42, df =4, 105, p <0.05) as a barrier for universities  being entrepreneurial. The post hoc assessments show that instructors  and full-time faculty in the other group significantly evaluated these  items as barriers more than assistant and associate faculty. Participants  in the other group significantly evaluated these items as barriers more  than associate participants. In addition, there is a significant difference  between the various groups of participants ’ work positions on evalu - ating “clash with research objectives ” (F =6.32, df =4, 105, p =0.000)  as a barrier for universities being entrepreneurially responsive.

Additionally, the instructors and full-time participants  significantly evaluated these items as barriers more than assistant par- ticipants. Furthermore, there is a significant difference between the  groups of participants ’ work positions on evaluating “inadequate cul- tural values ” (F =6.45, df =4, 105, p =0.000) as a barrier for uni- versities being entrepreneurial. The post hoc comparisons showed that  participants in all groups significantly evaluated this item as a barrier  more than assistant participants.  Moreover, there is a significant difference between the groups of  participants ’ work positions on participants ’ agreement of the statement  that “our university has a department or group dedicated to industry/  university liaison activities ” (F =2.56, df =4, 106, p <0.05). The post  hoc comparisons show that participants in the full-time and associate  groups significantly agreed on this statement more than assistant and  instructor participants. In addition, there is a significant difference be- tween the groups of participants ’ work positions on participants ’  agreement of the statement that “we give faculty members significant  freedom to pursue their career goals ” (F =3.49, df =4, 105, p <0.05).  The post hoc comparisons show that participants in the associate and  full-time faculty participants significantly agreed on this statement more  than assistant participant. Therefore, H2 is supported as faculty with  established work position have a significant impact on entrepreneurship  education.  4.3.

years. To test this, in- dependent sample t-tests were conducted. Significant t-test results for  participants ’ responses on having an international scientific project in  last five years are given in the following table. As it is illustrated in the  table, participants with such an experience evaluated “entrepreneurship  courses for staff ” as a requirement to make universities more entrepre - neurial with a higher mean compared to the participants without such  an experience. These participants also evaluated “entrepreneurship role  models ” as a requirement to make universities more entrepreneurial  with a higher mean compared to the participants without such an  experience. Furthermore, these participants evaluated “lack of experi - ence ” as a barrier for universities to be entrepreneurial with a higher  mean compared to the participants without such an experience.  Moreover, these participants evaluated “lack of funding ” as a barrier  for universities to be entrepreneurial with a higher mean compared to  the participants without such an experience. Additionally, these par- ticipants evaluated “traditional values ” as a barrier for universities to be  entrepreneurial with a higher mean compared to the participants  without such an experience. These participants also agreed with a higher  mean that compared to other similar departments in their regions, their  department has a reputation for its contribution to industry and society  compared to the participants without such an experience. Moreover,  these participants agreed with a higher mean that they try to generate  off-campus benefits from research projects compared to the participants  without such an experience.  The study also tested whether participants ’ response on questions  differ if they have ever spent more than six months abroad engaged in  scientific work. To test this, independent sample t-tests were conducted.  Significant t-test results for participants ’ responses on having such an
t-tests were conducted.  Significant t-test results for participants ’ responses on having such an  experience are given in the following table. As it is illustrated in the  table, participants with such an experience revealed that they support  the entrepreneurial university concept more than the participants  without such an experience. On the other hand, participants without  such an experience evaluated “favorable staff attitudes to entrepre - neurship ” as a requirement to make universities more entrepreneurial  with a higher mean compared to the participants with such an  experience. Participants without such an experience evaluated “traditional ways  of teaching ” as a barrier for universities to be entrepreneurial with a  higher mean compared to the participants with such an experience. The  participants with such an experience also agreed with a higher mean on  the statement that their university polices are best described as devel - oped “bottom-up ” using feedback from all levels of the university  compared to the participants without such an experience. Participants  without such an experience also agreed with a higher mean on the  statements that they do not encourage industry involvement in their  graduate student training and their faculty members rarely set up their  own companies or professional practices compared to the participants  with such an experience. Therefore, H3 is supported as faculty with  technical projects have more of a significant impact on entrepreneurship  education.  4.4. T-test results on international experience  The study tested whether participants ’ responses on some questions  differ if they have a preference to spend time working abroad. To test  this, independent sample t-tests were conducted. The study also tested  whether participants ’ responses on some questions differ if they prefer  to spend time working abroad are given in the following table. As it is  illustrated in the table, participants without such a
are given in the following table. As it is  illustrated in the table, participants without such a preference believe  that some faculties are more suitable to create their own income  compared to the participants with such a preference. Furthermore,  participants with such a preference evaluated “flexible organizational  structure ” as a requirement to make universities more entrepreneurial  with a higher mean compared to the participants without such a  preference.  Furthermore, participants without such a preference evaluated “lack  of physical resources ” as a barrier for universities to be entrepreneurial  with a higher mean compared to the participants with such a preference.  Moreover, the participants with such a preference also agreed with a  higher mean on the statements that they encourage their graduate stu- dents to engage in research with significant implications for industry or  society, many of their faculty members conduct research in partnership  with non-academic professionals, cooperation with organizations  outside the university significantly improves their research activities,  their faculty members often seek research opportunities outside the  traditional university environment, their faculty members feel they  benefit financially from their research efforts (in addition to their uni- versity salary) and their university rewards faculty members for their  entrepreneurial attempts compared to the participants without such a  preference. Therefore, H4 is supported as faculty with international  experience have more of a significant impact on entrepreneurial  education.  4.5. T-test results on private experience  The study also tested whether participants ’ responses on some  questions differ if they worked in the private sector. To test this, inde- pendent sample t-tests were conducted. Significant t-test results for  participants ’ responses on having such an experience are given in the  following table.

on having such an experience are given in the  following table. As it is illustrated in the table, participants without such  an experience evaluated “entrepreneurship role models ” as a require - ment to make universities more entrepreneurial with a higher mean  compared to the participants with such an experience.  These participants evaluated “state funding/dependency on the  state ” and “clash with teaching objectives ” as barriers for universities to  be entrepreneurial with a higher mean compared to the participants  with such an experience. In addition, these participants agreed with a  higher mean on the statements that in the last three years, they have  made major changes to their course offerings and curriculum and their  university rewards faculty members for their entrepreneurial attempts  compared to the participants without such an experience. Therefore, H5  is supported as faculty with private sector experience have more of a C. Ozen et al.

Faculty of diverse work experiences and positions have been  surveyed on entrepreneurship in the academic environment. Our anal- ysis reveals that the hypotheses in the study are supported with faculty  that have developed work experience and established work positions  having more of a significant impact on entrepreneurial education than  faculty without. Also, faculty with technical projects have more of a  significant impact on entrepreneurial instruction. Furthermore, faculty  with international and private sector experience have more of a signif - icant impact bringing personal knowledge to entrepreneurial education.  The evaluation of faculty members most significant variables  contributing to entrepreneurship education includes review of off-  campus activities. These activities comprise research, teaching,  external service to the university, and freedom to pursue their goals in  teaching methods of entrepreneurship courses of students. Also, faculty  members agreed on several factors such as their universities evaluating  faculty members ’ performance of entrepreneurship teaching, and have a  department or group dedicated to industry/university liaison activities  making collaboration tangible. Other factors faculty members agreed  upon are favorable faculty attitudes towards entrepreneurship, role  models to follow, and to steer away from traditional teaching methods  and embrace new approaches to better students ’ experience and  perspective on academic entrepreneurship.  The comparisons present the senior and executive participants  significantly evaluated cultural and government challenges as barriers  more than entry-level faculty.
evaluated cultural and government challenges as barriers  more than entry-level faculty. The assessments display that instructors  and full-time faculty significantly evaluated lack of physical resources,  university experience, clash with teaching objectives, and traditional  values as barriers more than assistant and associate faculty. The analysis  demonstrates that academic leaders can formulate incentives in teaching  when having individual awareness demonstrating the perceptions of  faculty and their attitudes toward entrepreneurship education in global  edification.  Entrepreneurship in university education is an innovative topic, and  the collective results are influential. Several models have been intro- duced and applied to the knowledge of the entrepreneurial university.  The models accessible are more tailored to the explicit university needs.  Challenges face entrepreneurship education. Various factors such as  negative attitudes and lack of support limit the progression of these  studies attempting to brand universities more entrepreneurial. There are  limited studies of international collaboration, but the few that exist  display valuable and industrious outcomes. Alongside teaching and  research, entrepreneurship awareness in the educational setting is  emerging and developing for students and faculty worldwide. The  interactive collaboration between university, industry, and government  will improve the world economies through the development and growth  of the entrepreneurship ecosystem in the academic environment for  generations to come.

En resumen, los estudios revisados abordan diversos aspectos relacionados con la educación emprendedora en el ámbito académico. Se destaca la importancia de la experiencia laboral diversa, la posición dentro de la universidad, la participación en proyectos técnicos, la experiencia internacional y en el sector privado de los miembros de la facultad en la promoción de la educación emprendedora. La colaboración entre academia, industria y gobierno se presenta como un factor crucial para fomentar ecosistemas emprendedores y estimular el crecimiento económico. Además, se exploran las diferencias de género en las actitudes hacia el emprendimiento, así como la influencia de la personalidad emprendedora en la intención emprendedora. Estos estudios ofrecen valiosas perspectivas sobre cómo mejorar la educación emprendedora y proporcionar información relevante para la toma de decisiones en el ámbito académico y político.
