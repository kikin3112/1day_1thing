Want more high-growth entrepreneurs? Then control corruption with less ine ﬀective bureaucracy Antonio Lecunaa, Boyd Cohenband Vesna Mandakovicc aSchool of Business and Economics, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile;bEADA Business School, Barcelona, Spain;cEntrepreneurship Institute, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile ABSTRACT For decades, scholars have been concerned with the role of public policy in stimulating entrepreneurial activity. Aside from pro-entrepreneurship policy, governments can also erect barriers to startup activity. Researchers have concluded that the degree of corruption in a country can become a signi ﬁcant deterrent to entrepreneurship, while research on the relationship between bureaucracy and startup rates has been inconclusive. In this study, we apply the theory of planned behaviour –in particular, the perceived behavioural control construct –to clarify the role of corruption and ine ﬀective bureaucracy both independently and jointly in their relationships with entrepreneurship participation rates. Data on individuals from 53 nations for the 2006 –2015 period were utilized to test the hypotheses. This research con ﬁrms that both are negatively associated with rates of startup activity and thatin the context of highly corrupt countries, the two constructs interact to further reduce startup activity.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 26 October 2018 Revised 7 June 2020Accepted 2 July 2020 KEYWORDS Entrepreneurship; corruption; procedural bureaucracy; theory of planned behaviour;perceived behaviour control;high-growth entrepreneurs; multilevel approach; global entrepreneurship monitor 1. Introduction Entrepreneurship policy seeks to in ﬂuence the level of entrepreneurial activity in a particular region (Lundstrom and Stevenson 2005 ) since increased levels of entrepreneurship have been found to support job growth (Birch 1979 ) and country competitiveness (Audretsch and Peña-Legazkue 2012 ). Researchers continue to pursue the question of
competitiveness (Audretsch and Peña-Legazkue 2012 ). Researchers continue to pursue the question of what factors, and which entrepreneurship policies, if any, are actually successful in stimulating rates of entrepreneurship and country competitiveness (Lecuna and Chávez 2018 ; Acs and Amorós 2008 ). However, results have been mixed at best regarding what role governments play in supporting more productive entrepreneurship in their territories (Capel- leras et al. 2008 ; Ribeiro-Soriano and Galindo-Martín 2012 ). Baumol ( 1990 ) suggested that policy may, perhaps, not be able to produce more entrepreneurs © 2020 The Author(s).

but could possibly direct, or ‘allocate, ’entrepreneurs to more desirable pursuits. Shane ( 2009 ) went further by suggesting that most entrepreneurship policy is unlikely to have any measurable impact on local economies, because most entre- preneurial activity, with or without government support, fails to generateemployment anyway. The lack of consensus regarding the potential for government policy to posi- tively impact the rate, or quality, of startups in a region has led some scholarsto turn their attention to the other side of the equation regarding government bar-riers. For example, Acs et al. ( 2009 ) provided empirical support to the notion that a range of barriers to entrepreneurial activity, including legal restrictions andtaxes, are negatively correlated with startup activity, while Murdock ( 2012 ) showed that business regulation has a negative impact on entrepreneurial activity. Leveraging institutional theory while investigating eighteen Latin American economies during the 2002 –2014 period, Lecuna and Chávez ( 2018 ) found weak evidence for an association between strengthening of the institutionalframework and the number of newly registered ﬁrms as a percentage of an econ- omy ’s working-age population. To further expand our knowledge concerning the barriers erected against entrepreneurial activity, this study uses a global sampleinstead of a region-speci ﬁc sample, multilevel data instead of country-level data alone, and most importantly, given that multilevel analysis focuses on the individ-ual, the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) –and the perceived behaviour control construct (PBC) –instead of institutional theory as the relevant conceptual framing for understanding the study ’s entrepreneurial-related data. The TPB, ﬁrst developed by Ajzen ( 1991 ), suggests that three types of beliefs, behavioural, normative, and control, in ﬂuence an individual ’s intentions to act. Ajzen ’s work has been leveraged in the following decades by entrepreneurship
’s intentions to act. Ajzen ’s work has been leveraged in the following decades by entrepreneurship scholars to identify factors that in ﬂuence entrepreneurial intentions (Boyd and Vozikis 1994 ) and to predict rates of nascent entrepreneurship (Serida and Morales 2011 ). Recently, TPB was utilized to understand what factors inﬂuence the growth intentions of entrepreneurs in developing countries (Lecuna, Cohen, and Chávez 2017 ). Within Ajzen ’s(1991 ) TPB is the construct of control beliefs. An individual ’s self-e ﬃcacy –that is, their belief in their own capability to be successful in a speci ﬁc pursuit –has been shown to be highly related to entrepreneurial intentions and actions (Zhao, Seibert, and Hills 2005 ). However, even in the context where an entrepreneur may have internal self- eﬃcacy, their beliefs regarding control over the success of their venture could be inﬂuenced by exogenously erected barriers, which are out of the entrepreneur ’s control. Speci ﬁcally for this research, we are interested in two of the most com- monly researched governmental barriers to entrepreneurship: corruption and ineﬀective bureaucracy (captured mainly by the degree of government corrup-tion and the amount of procedural bureaucracy). The study of corruption has been a source of debate. From one perspective, according to Le ﬀ(1964 ), corrupt public employees should be more e ﬃcient if526 A. LECUNA ET AL.
they were to charge directly for their remunerations, because by independently charging their supposed salary, the incentives to work should increase. Hunting-ton ( 1968 ) obtained similar results by arguing that corruption should reduce the governmental interference that adversely e ﬀects those economic decisions that would be favourable for growth. Lui ( 1985 ) extended this idea by proposing that corruption should accelerate slow and rigid bureaucratic processes.However, the more classical view regarding corruption will argue that corruptactivities should not be considered a solution to government in ﬂexibility, because government in ﬂexibility was deliberately instituted in the ﬁrst place to generate opportunities to commit acts of corruption, such as extortions andbribes. Moreover, corruption should never be considered an element ofeﬃciency, because the acceleration of bureaucratic process by corrupting public management decisions will eventually decelerate average times, sincecorrupt public employees and elected politicians will bene ﬁt from this deceleration. Based on the World Bank ’s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGIs), cor- ruption is de ﬁned as the perception of the extent to which public power is exer- cised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, aswell as capture of the state by elites and private interests. This de ﬁnition is similar to that of Bayley ( 1996 ), who suggested that corruption is the abuse of a public management position for personal or third parties ’beneﬁts against those interests of society and its institutions. Other authors, such as Harch(1993 ), developed a more practical de ﬁnition based on speci ﬁc corrupt actions, such as extortion, payo ﬀs, bribery, collection of charge fees, illegal gifts, illicit contributions, tax evasion or fraud, open public robbery, nepotism,unlawful appropriation of public funds or state property, and the abuse ofpublic authority. The de ﬁnition of Harch ( 1993 ) also
funds or state property, and the abuse ofpublic authority. The de ﬁnition of Harch ( 1993 ) also includes traﬃ co fi n ﬂu- ences, acceptance of compensations and gifts, use of privileged information,and any other activity that in ﬂuences the political system with the objective of obtaining bene ﬁts, either personal or for groups of interests. This study de ﬁnes corruption using the theoretical lenses of political science and economics. In contrast, procedural bureaucracy is measured from the per-spective of public administration (i.e. the number of procedures required to starta business), while entrepreneurial activity is de ﬁned based on the management and business literatures. According to Shane and Venkataraman ( 2000 , 218), entrepreneurship is the process and the set of enterprising individuals who dis-cover (or create), evaluate, exploit, and respond to situational cues and existingsources of opportunity. Essentially, entrepreneurship is the nexus of twophenomena: the work of entrepreneurs and the presence of lucrative opportu-nities (Shane and Venkataraman 2000 , 218). Using the Global Entrepreneurial Monitor dataset, this study measures entrepreneurial activity from two dimen-sions: total early-stage entrepreneurial activity (TEA) and high-growth expec-tation (i.e. high-aspiration) entrepreneurial activity (HAE). HAE is aINTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS 527
percentage of TEA ventures that have better opportunities to grow as measured by the number of employees. Consistent with how Shane ( 2009 ) implores policy- makers to shift their attention and resources towards high-potential and high-growth ventures, the focus of the study is on high-growth entrepreneurs,instead of on the opportunity-driven versus necessity-driven entrepreneurshipdichotomy. There are many reasons an individual may choose to become an entrepre- neur. In the past several decades, entrepreneurship researchers have chosen todiﬀerentiate necessity-driven entrepreneurs from opportunity-driven entrepre- neurs (Williams 2009 ). Necessity-driven entrepreneurship emerges when indi- viduals have no job prospects; consequently, they start a business as the onlyalternative to unemployment. In contrast, opportunity-driven entrepreneurship occurs when individuals identify a new and pro ﬁtable business opportunity (Lecuna, Cohen, and Chávez 2017 , 143 –144). According to Shane ( 2009 ), however, the signi ﬁcant attention invested in di ﬀerentiating between opportu- nity- and necessity-driven entrepreneurship is misguided, which is principally justiﬁ ed by the assertion that the distinction between opportunity- and neces- sity-driven entrepreneurship does not exist, since entrepreneurs can buildhigh-growth, job-creating, wealth-generating ventures even if their motivationfor starting a business is out of sheer necessity (Shane 2009 ). Moreover, most opportunity-driven entrepreneurs have founded businesses that have more incommon with self-employment than with the creation of high-growth compa-nies (Lecuna and Chávez 2018 ,3 3 –34) and ‘are not interested in growing their businesses, and fewer still manage to do so ’(Shane 2009 , 142), whereas necessity-driven entrepreneurs have strong growth potential based on the neces-sity to survive as a motivation for successful entrepreneurship (Lecuna 2019 , 13). In the next section, we provide an overview of the TPB from an
entrepreneurship (Lecuna 2019 , 13). In the next section, we provide an overview of the TPB from an applied psychological lens and its application to entrepreneurship research. We thenreview the evolving literatures on both corruption (political science) and pro-cedural bureaucracy (public administration) in independently a ﬀecting entre- preneurship (management science) in regions around the globe. This is followed by the formal development of three hypotheses. We then detail our data sources and present our methodology for testing the hypotheses. We con-clude with a discussion of the results and the implications of our ﬁndings on TPB and potential avenues for future research. 2. Literature review 2.1. TPB in entrepreneurship research The TPB was developed as an extension to Ajzen and Fishbein ’s(1980 ) prior theory development known as the Theory of Reasoned Action. TPB has been applied to a range of social science disciplines and has generally been found528 A. LECUNA ET AL.
to have strong predictive capabilities. In a meta-study of the accumulated results of the application of the TPB across 185 studies published through 1997, Armi-tage and Conner ( 2001 ) found that TPB accounted for 39% of the variation in intentions and 27% of the variation in behaviour. In entrepreneurship research, TPB has often been leveraged to predict entre- preneurial intentions (Politis et al. 2016 ) as opposed to behaviour (Kautonen, Gel- deren, and Fink 2013 ). Such use has occurred despite TPBs having been developed to predict intentions and behaviour, and TPB has been used for both purposes innumerous social science disciplines (Ajzen 1991 ; Armitage and Conner 2001 ). Entrepreneurship scholars have also found consistent results in predicting entre-preneurial intentions from TPB ’s belief constructs, with approximately 35% of the variation in intentions explained in TPB models (Aloulou 2016 ). Kautonen, Gel- deren, and Fink ( 2013 ) published one of the ﬁrst complete tests of TPB in entre- preneurship research by leveraging a longitudinal approach to explore therelationships between beliefs, intentions, and actions. With a sample of nearly1000 individuals in Austria and Finland between 2011 and 2012, Kautonen, Gel-deren, and Fink ( 2013 ) found that 59% of the variation in intention and 31% of the variation in action to form a venture were predicted by the TPB model. Interest-ingly, PBC, measured through survey questions associated with the capability toform a venture and perceived control of the outcome, was a signi ﬁcant factor in predicting both intention and behaviour. Early entrepreneurship traits research sought to con ﬁrm that individuals with an internal locus of control were more apt to launch new ventures. Entrepreneurshipscholars have long abandoned trying to identify universal personality traits thatpredict entrepreneurial action and success. Nevertheless, the PBC construct fromTPB has continued to show predictive capability in many
Nevertheless, the PBC construct fromTPB has continued to show predictive capability in many disciplines, includingentrepreneurship. However, entrepreneurship scholars have yet to fully determinethe full range of factors that in ﬂuence PBC in its relationship with entrepreneurial action. For this study, we are particularly interested in the relationship between twogovernmental barriers, corruption and ine ﬀective bureaucracy, which are measured for testing purposes as the perception of the degree of corruption and procedural bureaucracy. Below, we will provide a brief literature review of the extant research pertaining to corruption, procedural bureaucracy, and entrepreneurship. 2.2. Corruption and entrepreneurship Exogenous variables can in ﬂuence an individual ’s attitudes and moderate the relationship between entrepreneurial intentions and behaviour (Krueger,Reilly, and Carsrud 2000 ). Government corruption and procedural bureauc- racy are two ways in which governments can inhibit entrepreneurial action. A growing body of research has argued that decreasing the level of corruption encourages entrepreneurial activity (Anokhin and Schulze 2008 ; Aidis, Estrin, and Mickiewicz 2012 ; Lecuna and Chávez 2018 ). In the absence of strong ruleINTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS 529
enforcement –which is a common trait of highly corrupt governments –it becomes risky to rely on legal contracts and/or the goodwill of service providers (Alchian and Woodward 1988 ). Alternatives to trust as foundations of entrepre- neurship, such as a ﬀect, kinship, and/or ethnic identity, are economically inferior because they necessarily limit the size of the provider pool and exposepromising entrepreneurs to a greater risk of adverse selection. Corruption alsocreates disincentives for investment in innovation and other economic activities,with payo ﬀs that are di ﬃcult or costly to monitor because they are uncertain and/or temporally distant (Teece 1981 ). In particular, we support the speci ﬁc argument that corruption may encou- rage unproductive and destructive forms of entrepreneurship and breed negativesocietal attitudes towards entrepreneurs (Baumol 1990 ). This is mainly because corruption increases agency costs (Alchian and Woodward 1988 ), transaction costs (Luhmann 1988 ), and institutional risks for prospective entrepreneurs, forcing them to rely on one-sided trust (Anokhin and Schulze 2008 ). Thus, there are examples, such as the so-called ‘China Conundrum, ’whereby entrepre- neurs among a country ’s elite can actually bene ﬁt from a corrupt system (Bhoothalingam 2012 ); we would consider this unproductive entrepreneurship and not always representative of productive or market-based entrepreneurialactivity. In contrast, better control over corruption should increase cash ﬂow reliability and allow entrepreneurs across political and economic spectra tocapture a greater share of revenue (Anokhin and Schulze 2008 ). 2.3. Ine ﬀective bureaucracy and entrepreneurship Government bureaucracy that can inhibit startup activity is associated withextensive government procedures for new ﬁrm formation and burdens associ- ated with growing a new venture, such as labour policy, credit restrictions, taxpolicy and ﬁrm closure (van Stel, Storey, and Thurik 2007 ). For
policy, credit restrictions, taxpolicy and ﬁrm closure (van Stel, Storey, and Thurik 2007 ). For this research, we are particularly interested in the extant literature pertaining to the relation-ship between the number of government procedures imposed on startups andthe rate of startups in a country. The number of procedures and lengths of time required to start a ﬁrm in countries around the globe varies widely. To meet government requirements for starting to operate a business in Mozambique, an entrepreneur must complete 19 procedures taking at least 149 business days and pay US $256 in fees. To do the same, an entrepreneur in Italy needs to follow 16 di ﬀerent pro- cedures, pay US$3946 in fees, and wait at least 62 business days to acquire the necessary permits. In contrast, an entrepreneur in Canada can ﬁnish the process in two days by paying US$280 in fees and completing only two procedures. (Djankov et al. 2002,1 ) In contrast to theoretical expectations, van Stel, Storey, and Thurik ( 2007 ) did notﬁnd a relationship between the number of procedures for startups and the rate of nascent entrepreneurship. van Stel, Storey, and Thurik ( 2007 ) did530 A. LECUNA ET AL.
however ﬁnd that higher capital requirements for startups was negatively corre- lated with the rate of nascent entrepreneurship. Although more procedures for startups should intuitively have a negative e ﬀect on startup activity in a country, the extant research on the topic has been inconclusive. A primary objective ofthis study is to clarify the impact that higher numbers of procedures have onstartup activity rates across countries. 3. Hypotheses We have developed three hypotheses in order to determine if two di ﬀerent forms of government barriers serve independently or collectively to hinder new ﬁrm formation. Below we develop the hypotheses, present our data and methodology, interpret the results, and discuss implications for TPB and entrepreneurshippolicy research. While Krueger, Reilly, and Carsrud ( 2000 ) posited that exogen- ous variables would be weak predictors of entrepreneurial activity, our hypoth-eses predict that the perceived loss of behaviour control associated withincreasing corruption and ineﬀ ective bureaucracy will be signi ﬁcantly associated with decreased rates of entrepreneurship. 3.1. Hypothesis 1: corruption and rates of nascent entrepreneurship As discussed previously, corruption rates in a country have been found to benegatively associated with entrepreneurship behaviour. Prior results are con-sistent with what would be expected utilizing TPB and, in particular, thePBC construct. TPB scholars have found that individuals with high degrees of self-e ﬃcacy may be deterred from acting on their intentions towards a new behaviour if they perceive that exogenous factors limit their volitional control (Ajzen 2002 ). A corrupt environment distorts entrepreneurial opportunities and returns: it facili- tates the development of entrepreneurs willing and able to engage in corrupt prac- tices while acting as a barrier that hinders the entry or growth of businesses byentrepreneurs who are unwilling to engage in corrupt practices. (Aidis, Estrin, and
of businesses byentrepreneurs who are unwilling to engage in corrupt practices. (Aidis, Estrin, and Mickiewicz 2012 , 122) Corruption has been observed to be negatively associated with entrepreneurial entry for three related reasons (Aidis, Estrin, and Mickiewicz 2012 ): (1) it dis- courages entrepreneurs who are unwilling to engage in corruption to advancetheir enterprise; (2) it encourages destructive forms of entrepreneurship; and(3) it can prevent businesses from growing in order to avoid governmentsextracting increased revenues and resources from the company. Referringback to the PBC construct from TPB, we therefore hypothesize that higher rates of corruption will lead to lower levels of new ﬁrm formation due to the per- ception of prospective entrepreneurs that the exogenous lack of corruption control will negatively in ﬂuence their entry and growth prospects.INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS 531
Hypothesis 1: Increasing corruption will decrease the probability that individuals engage in early-stage entrepreneurial activities. 3.2. Hypothesis 2: ine ﬀective bureaucracy and rates of nascent entrepreneurship As discussed previously, governments may also ‘get in the way ’of entrepre- neurial action by having high barriers to startup through bureaucratic pro- cedures for ﬁrm formation. In a highly cited study of procedural bureaucracy in 85 countries, Djankov et al. ( 2002 ) found that procedural bureaucracy led to several negative outcomes for aspiring entrepreneurs andthe economy. van Stel, Storey, and Thurik ( 2007 ) suggested that aspiring nascent-stage entrepreneurs would be more likely to be deterred by govern-mental barriers to entry more than by barriers. van Stel, Storey, and Thurik(2007 ) identiﬁ ed several potential government deterrents of new ﬁrm for- mation, including minimum capital requirements, labour market regulations,and procedural bureaucracy. Contrary to van Stel, Storey, and Thurik ’s(2007 )ﬁndings, and consistent with Djankov et al. ( 2002 ), we posit that the number of procedures required for ﬁrm formation, which we have referred to as procedural bureaucracy, will in factdeter new ﬁrm formation. Because procedural bureaucracy is an exogenous factor outside the control of the entrepreneur, the PBC associated with thisaspect of ﬁrm formation is low and can result in impeding the relationship between an entrepreneur ’s intentions and their behaviour, as represented by the formalization of their new ﬁrm. Hypothesis 2: Ine ﬀective bureaucracy, captured by higher rates of procedural bureauc- racy, will decrease the probability that individuals engage in early-stage entrepreneur- ial activities. 3.3. Hypothesis 3: combined e ﬀects of increasing corruption and ine ﬀective bureaucracy on new ﬁrm formation The two constructs tied to our ﬁrst two hypotheses, corruption and procedural bureaucracy, have been linked to each other in the extant policy
corruption and procedural bureaucracy, have been linked to each other in the extant policy literature. Djankov et al. ( 2002 ) introduced the tollbooth hypothesis, which suggested that higher procedural bureaucracy leads directly to increased corruption as gov-ernment oﬃ cials oﬀ er to ‘grease the wheels ’in return for ﬁnancial compensation. A direct implication of the tollbooth hypothesis is that corruption levels and the inten- sity of entry regulation are positively correlated. In fact, since in many countries in our sample politicians run businesses, the regulation of entry produces the double bene ﬁt of corruption revenues and reduced competition for the incumbent businesses already aﬃliated with the politicians. (Djankov et al. 2002 , 26)532 A. LECUNA ET AL.
This interconnection between corruption and procedural bureaucracy has been conﬁrmed in follow-up studies of the tollbooth hypothesis (Guriev 2004; Ahlin and Bose 2007). Surprisingly, however, the two constructs of corruption and pro- cedural bureaucracy have rarely been incorporated into empirical studies withregard to their combined e ﬀects on startup rates (Djankov 2009). As the tollbooth hypothesis demonstrates, corruption and procedural bureaucracy combine toform an even more insurmounicic barrier to new ﬁrm formation. This barrier, when perceived by aspiring nascent entrepreneurs, would even further lowerthe entrepreneur ’sP B Co fn e w ﬁrm formation. We suggest that the mixed results pertaining to the impact of the number of procedures on startup ratesreported in earlier studies may be due to the lack of empirical examination ofthe connection between procedures and corruption. Leveraging PBC, it is reason- able to expect that the combination of corruption and procedural bureaucracy leads to reduced control beliefs of entrepreneurs, resulting in further detrimentalimpacts on startup rates. Therefore, we hypothesize the following. Hypothesis 3: Corruption rates and levels of procedural bureaucracy combine to further lower rates of entrepreneurial activity 4. Methodology Because our data feature a hierarchical structure –namely, individual and country-year levels –we apply a multilevel approach to test our hypotheses. Our source for individual-level data derives from the global entrepreneurship monitor (GEM) adult population survey (APS), which covers a representativesample of the population in each participant country (Autio, Pathak, and Wenn- berg 2013 ). We use data from the 10-year period 2006 –2015. Our analysis includes 53 countries 1and covers responses from 725,153 individuals. Data for country-year variables were gathered from the WGI and the World Economic Forum ’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). While other studies employ data from the Heritage
Forum ’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). While other studies employ data from the Heritage Foundation/Wall Street Journal to measure institutional factors (see Aidis, Estrin, and Mickiewicz2012; McMullen, Bagby, and Palich 2008), including ‘freedom from corrup- tion, ’as key variables of interest, the dataset presented here uses the World Bank ’s measurement for government institutions based on the WGI, as suggested by Djankov et al. (2002).

4.1. Measures 4.1.1. Individual-level dependent variables We use two dependent variables to test our hypothesis: the ﬁrst is the early-stage entrepreneur (TEA), and the second is a subset of the early-stage entrepreneurs who are involved in a high-growth-expectation venture (HAE). TEA is based on the life cycle of the entrepreneurial process, which covers nascent entrepreneurswho have taken some action to create a new business in the past year but havenot paid any salaries or wages in the last three months, or the owners/managersof businesses that have paid wages and salaries for more than three months butless than 42 months. TEA is composed of both opportunity-driven entrepre-neurship as well as necessity-based entrepreneurship. While some scholarshave sought to distinguish these metrics in studying rates of entrepreneurship,others have argued that the distinction is largely irrelevant because ‘people can build high-growth, job-creating, wealth-generating companies even iftheir motivation for starting a business was necessity ’(Shane 2009 , 142). HAE considers the high-aspiration ventures that are part of the TEA. HAE is thusdeﬁned by entrepreneurs who expect to employ at least 5 employees 5 years from now. HAE is negatively correlated with TEA. In our results section, wefurther interpret the relationship between our hypotheses and the twodiﬀerent dependent variables identi ﬁed in this section. 4.1.2. Country-level predictors Corruption. The corruption indicator (CORR) is the inverse value of ‘control of corruption, ’which is drawn from the WGI. We transformed this variable so that the sign would be harmonized; moreover, for ease of interpretation, we centredthe variable on zero. CORR re ﬂects the perception of the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of cor-ruption, as well as capture of the state by elites and private interests. Theexpected direction of the corruption coe ﬃcient in the regression models
and private interests. Theexpected direction of the corruption coe ﬃcient in the regression models is nega- tive, which implies that higher levels of corruption negatively a ﬀects entrepre- neurial activity. Following Lecuna ( 2012 , 144), we tested the ‘control of corruption ’variable as a valid country-level predictor against four potential endogenous factors from the 2008 –2009 GCI: property rights, strength of audit- ing and reporting standards, judicial independence, and reliability of police ser-vices. The correlation coe ﬃcients between the ﬁve measures, including the ‘control of corruption ’indicator, ranged anywhere from .76 to .96, which was expected due to all simply being variants of a lack of corruption. Procedural bureaucracy. The information for the second independent variable of interest, the number of procedures required to start a business, or procedural bureaucracy, is measured using the GCI. The World Economic Forum ’s Global Competitiveness report remains the most comprehensive worldwide assessment of national competitiveness, providing a platform for dialogue between534 A. LECUNA ET AL.
government, business, and civil society about the actions required to improve economic prosperity. In line with the ‘H2’hypothesis, procedural bureaucracy is expected to enter the regression model with a strongly negative sign, indicatingthat fewer bureaucratic procedures lead to increased entrepreneurial activity. 4.1.3. Individual-level control variables Following previous research (see, for example, Arenius and Minniti 2005 ), we include four perceptual variables that have been linked to entrepreneurial beha-viours as proxies of (1) social capital within the entrepreneurial ecosystem, (2) the individual ’s perceived self-eﬃcacy in entrepreneurial e ﬀorts, (3) the fear of failure when undertaking new business venture activities, and (4) opportunity recognition ,r eﬂecting the individual ’s alertness to opportunities. We also include demographic characteristics, such as age,sexand level of education . These variables were obtained from the GEM APS data. Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the variables used in the empirical exercise at the individ-ual and the country levels of analysis. 4.1.4. Country-level control variables Drawing from prior studies of rates of entrepreneurship, we employ a series ofmacroeconomic indicators as control variables for testing our hypotheses. Theﬁrst macroeconomic explanatory variable is the Gross Domestic Product percapita ( GDP ), as expressed in current U.S. dollars per person. Log GDP per capita values are used to better interpret the GDP per capita explanatory variablein the regression models and to avoid excessive weighting of extremely high andlow observations.

Estimation technique Because we use two levels of analysis (the individual and country levels), weanalyse the data using hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) methods. Multilevelmodelling is appropriate when data are hierarchically structured –that is, when they consist of units grouped at di ﬀerent levels of a hierarchy (Aguinis, Gottfred- son, and Culpepper 2013 ; Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal 2006 ). Autio, Pathak, and Wennberg ( 2013 ) recommend the use of a multilevel approach in studies of institutions and entrepreneurship, and they encourage GEM data entrepreneur-ship research to use this technique. Thus, we estimate a model speci ﬁed by the following equation (Equation (1)): Y ijt=b0+b1−2Country pred jt+b3−9Indiv controls ijt +b10−11Country controls jt+mijt+1jt, where Yijtrepresents the dependent variables (TEA or HAE); Country pred jt represents the country predictors; Indiv controls ijtrepresents the individual controls; and Country controls jtrepresents the country control variables. (Table 2 presents the correlations among the controls, predictors, and dependent variables). The combination of mijt+1jtcomprises the random part of the equation, where 1jtrepresents the country-level residuals, and mijtrepresents the
part of the equation, where 1jtrepresents the country-level residuals, and mijtrepresents the individual-level residuals. 5. Results Table 3 reports the results from estimating Equation (1) for two measures of entrepreneurial activity. The ﬁrst interesting point to highlight is that di ﬀerent measurements of entrepreneurship are a ﬀected in di ﬀerent ways, which was expected, because HAE tends to capture registered ﬁrms with high-growth aspirations. The main focus in Table 3 is the e ﬀect of the degree of corruption and ine ﬀective bureaucracy measured by the number of procedures required to start a business.536 A. LECUNA ET AL.

provides reasonably good explanatory power for entrepreneurial activity when judged by the usual t-test of signi ﬁcance. This ﬁnding provides support for the ‘H1’hypothesis, which speci ﬁcally tests whether higher levels of corruption in a country have a negative and signi ﬁcant impact on total entrepreneurial activity. However, in the case of HAE in Column 3, we do not ﬁnd a signi ﬁcant coeﬃcient. 5.2. Hypothesis 2: relationship between procedural bureaucracy and entrepreneurial activity In the case of procedural bureaucracy, the impact of more bureaucracy in entre- preneurial activity is signi ﬁcant in all the speci ﬁcations, but the direction of the eﬀect is di ﬀerent when comparing the di ﬀerent de ﬁnitions of entrepreneurial activity. HAE is negatively associated with more bureaucracy( b=−0.0311; p,0.01), whereas TEA is positively related (b=0.0591; p,0.01). An additional procedure to start a business reduces the HAE by approximately 3%. Conversely, as TEA likely also includes largenumbers of informal ventures, the increase in levels of bureaucracy could even-tually become an additional exogenous barrier leading aspiring entrepreneurs toavoid formality. Therefore, in the case of TEA, more procedural bureaucracyincreases the percentage of informal entrepreneurs. 5.3. Hypothesis 3: interaction e ﬀects between corruption and procedural bureaucracy The interaction term between corruption and procedural bureaucracy isreported in Table 3 (Columns 2 and 4) for all the de ﬁnitions of entrepreneurial activity. We ﬁnd this interaction e ﬀect to be signi ﬁcant only for the TEA deﬁnition of entrepreneurial activity ( b=−0.0033; p,0.01), which implies that the combination of high corruption and relatively greater proceduresrequired to start a business provides an additional boost to total entrepreneurialactivity over and above the direct e ﬀects. 6. Limitations, discussion, and future research This research draws on panel data from 53 economies to empirically test three
and future research This research draws on panel data from 53 economies to empirically test three hypotheses derived from TPB. Speci ﬁcally, we set out to determine the relationships among corruption, procedural bureaucracy, and two measuresof entrepreneurial activity (TEA and HAE) in 53 countries around theglobe. We were particularly intereste d in the application of PBC from TPB, which suggests that entrepreneurs who may otherwise be inclined (entrepre-neurial intention) to start a new ﬁrm and who believe they are capable of doing so may choose not to act on those intentions because there areINTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS 539
important factors out of their control that may negatively a ﬀect their ability to actually incorporate a new ﬁrm. All three of our hypotheses were con ﬁrmed to some degree: corruption is associated with lower rates of total entrepreneurial activity (H1); ine ﬀective bureaucracy, as measured by the number of procedures required of a startup, is associated with lower rates of high-aspiration entrepreneurial activity (H2);and procedural bureaucracy moderates the relationship between corruptionand total entrepreneurial activity (H3). These conclusions are consistent withprior conceptual work by Djankov et al. ( 2002 ) and later empirical work explor- ing the tollbooth hypothesis as it pertains to the relationship between corruptionand procedural bureaucracy (Guriev 2004 ; Ahlin and Bose 2007 ). However, we cannot fully support our three hypotheses, because corruption was not signi ﬁcant in the HAE speci ﬁcation; moreover, procedural bureaucracy enters the TEA speci ﬁcation with a highly signi ﬁcant negative sign, indicating that as procedural bureaucracy increases, it becomes likely that more formalentrepreneurs will consider informal startups, which is likely captured by theTEA measurements from the GEM (Valdez and Richardson 2013 ). Similarly, though we were able to con ﬁrm that corruption and procedural bureaucracy jointly have a greater detrimental impact on TEA, we were not able to fullyextend prior research by ﬁnding a signi ﬁcant interaction e ﬀect between high levels of corruption and procedural bureaucracy as they pertain to HAE. While the link between corruption and entrepreneurial activity has been conﬁrmed consistently in the extant literature (Aidis, Estrin, and Mickiewicz 2012 ), the role of ine ﬀective bureaucracy, independently or jointly with corrup- tion, had yet to be clearly con ﬁrmed in prior research. Given the largely incon- clusive or inconsistent results found in numerous studies of pro-entrepreneurship policy and the rates or quality of
results found in numerous studies of pro-entrepreneurship policy and the rates or quality of entrepreneurial activity, webelieve our results contribute to the conversation about the diﬀ erent positive and negative roles governments may play in a ﬀecting the entrepreneurial phenomenon in their country or region. These results suggest new lines of research related to governmental barriers to entrepreneurship in the context of TPB. Longitudinal studies, similar to that ofKautonen, Gelderen, and Fink ( 2013 ), using the same or expanded government barrier indicators could allow for deeper insights into the relationship betweenintentions and behaviour. Due to our reliance on secondary data, we were unableto test a full TPB model that could capture data from aspiring entrepreneurs atthe concept stage and explore which aspects of TPB and PBC a ﬀected the relationship between initial intention and eventual action or inaction. Measuring corruption also presents a signi ﬁcant challenge. Because corruption is a criminal activity, methodologies measuring it must be sustained on the sub-jective perceptions re ﬂected in questionnaires and surveys, which distorts any possibility of achieving precise measurements. Moreover, the intrinsic problemwith relying on the perception of corruption is that corruption itself has540 A. LECUNA ET AL.
diﬀerent meanings to di ﬀerent people. As such, corruption varies greatly depend- ing on the nationality of the corrupt individual. For example, it is common for foreign entrepreneurs to pay sums of money far in excess of the nominal buildingpermit fee compared to the fees paid by local entrepreneurs. In addition to the rel-evant limitation presented by the measurement of corrupt activities, quantifyingthe real impact of corruption on society based mainly on the sum of individualcases is also very misleading. For example, which is more corrupt: to pay a restau-rant waiter an extra tip for a beachfront window table in Rio de Janeiro, to reselltickets for a baseball game in Santo Domingo, to collect bribes by a low-paid tra ﬃc oﬃcer in La Paz, or to award multi-billion-dollar military contracts for the U.S. Department of Defense? Based solely on the amount of money involved, thereshould be no doubt as to which is more corrupt. Furthermore, by using the perception of corruption and procedural bureauc- racy, we omitted other government barriers that may also in ﬂuence an aspiring entrepreneur ’s PBC. Other government barriers worth exploring include taxa- tion policy, competition policy, and transparency, among many others. Whichof the aforementioned barriers, independently or in combination, also deterentrepreneurial activity? Naturally, an extension to this research relates to nor-mative policy guidance for governments seeking to get out of the way. While thejury is still out on the e ﬃcacy of pro-entrepreneurship policy, the evidence is mounting that governments can clearly impede entrepreneurial activitythrough a range of barriers erected intentionally or unintentionally. Controlling corruption is an extremely di ﬃcult endeavour. Although strengthening governmental institutions is insu ﬃcient, it is a strong ﬁrst step in the right direction. In reference to the ‘cures ’of corruption, Tanzi ( 1998 , 587) argued the following: The greatest mistake that can be made is
’of corruption, Tanzi ( 1998 , 587) argued the following: The greatest mistake that can be made is to rely on a strategy that depends excessively on actions in a single area, such as increasing the salaries of the public sector employ-ees, or increasing penalties, or creating an anticorruption oﬃ ce, and then to expect quick results. However, decreasing the number of procedures required to start a business is a relatively straightforward public policy measure. Therefore, this research has important policy implications, because the theory and evidence presented here indicate that stimulating entrepreneurial activity in an economy is moreeﬀective when policy reforms aimed at better control over corruption are implemented in combination with decreasing bureaucratic procedures. Finally, one of the contributions of this research is its use of two di ﬀerent measures of entrepreneurial activity. As highlighted in the Results section, wefound unique and sometimes con ﬂicting results regarding the relationship between corruption and procedural bureaucracy on startup activity, dependingon which of the two measures was utilized (TEA versus HAE). As Valdez andRichardson ( 2013) suggested, further research is needed to understand theINTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS 541
unique role informal entrepreneurship plays in studies of entrepreneurship activity. We found that TEA was associated with signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent behaviour with respect to procedural bureaucracy. Perhaps one reason for entrepreneurshipscholars ’inability to obtain consistent results in studies of entrepreneurship activity is the lack of consistency in the dependent variable chosen. 7. Conclusion There is growing consensus that corruption is an impediment to entrepreneurship (Anokhin and Schulze 2008; Aidis, Estrin, and Mickiewicz 2012; Acs, Desai, and Flapper 2008). With regard to ine ﬀective bureaucracy and new ﬁrm formation, however, results have been mixed (van Stel, Storey, and Thurik 2007). Further- more, despite the logical connections between corruption and bureaucracy,these constructs have rarely been related in empirical studies of government impe-diments to entrepreneurship (Estrin, Korosteleva, and Mickiewicz 2013). The focus of this research was to clarify the roles of corruption and ine ﬀective bureaucracy as they pertain to government barriers to entrepreneurship, therebyextending our understanding of control beliefs within the TPB. In this research,we developed three hypotheses. The ﬁrst two sought to clarify the roles of cor- ruption and procedural bureaucracy as independent constructs a ﬀecting entre- preneurial activity in an economy. The third hypothesis sought to relate the twoconstructs to each other in order to determine if there is an interaction e ﬀect between corruption and procedural bureaucracy as a combined factoraﬀecting entrepreneurship activity in a region. We obtained data from several sources in support of this research (GEM, WGI, and GCI). The evidence is mounting that government barriers can a ﬀect the relationship between an aspiring entrepreneur ’s intention to start a ﬁrm and their eventual behaviour. This study contributes to the ongoing conversation about demon-strating a linkage between corruption, procedural bureaucracy,
the ongoing conversation about demon-strating a linkage between corruption, procedural bureaucracy, and entrepre-neurial activity. In all, our ﬁndings suggest direct policy implications: reducing ine ﬀective bureaucracy in ﬂuences individuals ’engagement in high- quality entrepreneurship. Policymakers could implement simple regulatorychanges that can facilitate business development, such as cutting bureaucraticred tape or eliminating unnecessary procedures for ﬁrm creation. Alleviating corruption is a more di ﬃcult endeavour, but initiatives that increase the states’ modernization, transparency, and accountability have been implemented successfully, for example, in some Latin American countries with the support ofthe Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). It is quite possible that Baumol ( 1990 ) and Shane ( 2009 ) are correct in arguing that pro-entrepreneurial policy may not increase the number or quality of entrepreneurs but instead that bad government may impede otherwise promising startups from ever getting o ﬀthe ground. We believe this to be a fertile area for future research.542 A. LECUNA ET AL.

Want more high-growth entrepreneurs? Then control corruption with less ine ﬀective bureaucracy Antonio Lecunaa, Boyd Cohenband Vesna Mandakovicc aSchool of Business and Economics, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile;bEADA Business School, Barcelona, Spain;cEntrepreneurship Institute, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile ABSTRACT For decades, scholars have been concerned with the role of public policy in stimulating entrepreneurial activity. Aside from pro-entrepreneurship policy, governments can also erect barriers to startup activity. Researchers have concluded that the degree of corruption in a country can become a signi ﬁcant deterrent to entrepreneurship, while research on the relationship between bureaucracy and startup rates has been inconclusive. In this study, we apply the theory of planned behaviour –in particular, the perceived behavioural control construct –to clarify the role of corruption and ine ﬀective bureaucracy both independently and jointly in their relationships with entrepreneurship participation rates. Data on individuals from 53 nations for the 2006 –2015 period were utilized to test the hypotheses. This research con ﬁrms that both are negatively associated with rates of startup activity and thatin the context of highly corrupt countries, the two constructs interact to further reduce startup activity.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 26 October 2018 Revised 7 June 2020Accepted 2 July 2020 KEYWORDS Entrepreneurship; corruption; procedural bureaucracy; theory of planned behaviour;perceived behaviour control;high-growth entrepreneurs; multilevel approach; global entrepreneurship monitor 1. Introduction Entrepreneurship policy seeks to in ﬂuence the level of entrepreneurial activity in a particular region (Lundstrom and Stevenson 2005 ) since increased levels of entrepreneurship have been found to support job growth (Birch 1979 ) and country competitiveness (Audretsch and Peña-Legazkue 2012 ). Researchers continue to pursue the question of
competitiveness (Audretsch and Peña-Legazkue 2012 ). Researchers continue to pursue the question of what factors, and which entrepreneurship policies, if any, are actually successful in stimulating rates of entrepreneurship and country competitiveness (Lecuna and Chávez 2018 ; Acs and Amorós 2008 ). However, results have been mixed at best regarding what role governments play in supporting more productive entrepreneurship in their territories (Capel- leras et al. 2008 ; Ribeiro-Soriano and Galindo-Martín 2012 ). Baumol ( 1990 ) suggested that policy may, perhaps, not be able to produce more entrepreneurs © 2020 The Author(s).

but could possibly direct, or ‘allocate, ’entrepreneurs to more desirable pursuits. Shane ( 2009 ) went further by suggesting that most entrepreneurship policy is unlikely to have any measurable impact on local economies, because most entre- preneurial activity, with or without government support, fails to generateemployment anyway. The lack of consensus regarding the potential for government policy to posi- tively impact the rate, or quality, of startups in a region has led some scholarsto turn their attention to the other side of the equation regarding government bar-riers. For example, Acs et al. ( 2009 ) provided empirical support to the notion that a range of barriers to entrepreneurial activity, including legal restrictions andtaxes, are negatively correlated with startup activity, while Murdock ( 2012 ) showed that business regulation has a negative impact on entrepreneurial activity. Leveraging institutional theory while investigating eighteen Latin American economies during the 2002 –2014 period, Lecuna and Chávez ( 2018 ) found weak evidence for an association between strengthening of the institutionalframework and the number of newly registered ﬁrms as a percentage of an econ- omy ’s working-age population. To further expand our knowledge concerning the barriers erected against entrepreneurial activity, this study uses a global sampleinstead of a region-speci ﬁc sample, multilevel data instead of country-level data alone, and most importantly, given that multilevel analysis focuses on the individ-ual, the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) –and the perceived behaviour control construct (PBC) –instead of institutional theory as the relevant conceptual framing for understanding the study ’s entrepreneurial-related data. The TPB, ﬁrst developed by Ajzen ( 1991 ), suggests that three types of beliefs, behavioural, normative, and control, in ﬂuence an individual ’s intentions to act. Ajzen ’s work has been leveraged in the following decades by entrepreneurship
’s intentions to act. Ajzen ’s work has been leveraged in the following decades by entrepreneurship scholars to identify factors that in ﬂuence entrepreneurial intentions (Boyd and Vozikis 1994 ) and to predict rates of nascent entrepreneurship (Serida and Morales 2011 ). Recently, TPB was utilized to understand what factors inﬂuence the growth intentions of entrepreneurs in developing countries (Lecuna, Cohen, and Chávez 2017 ). Within Ajzen ’s(1991 ) TPB is the construct of control beliefs. An individual ’s self-e ﬃcacy –that is, their belief in their own capability to be successful in a speci ﬁc pursuit –has been shown to be highly related to entrepreneurial intentions and actions (Zhao, Seibert, and Hills 2005 ). However, even in the context where an entrepreneur may have internal self- eﬃcacy, their beliefs regarding control over the success of their venture could be inﬂuenced by exogenously erected barriers, which are out of the entrepreneur ’s control. Speci ﬁcally for this research, we are interested in two of the most com- monly researched governmental barriers to entrepreneurship: corruption and ineﬀective bureaucracy (captured mainly by the degree of government corrup-tion and the amount of procedural bureaucracy). The study of corruption has been a source of debate. From one perspective, according to Le ﬀ(1964 ), corrupt public employees should be more e ﬃcient if526 A. LECUNA ET AL.
they were to charge directly for their remunerations, because by independently charging their supposed salary, the incentives to work should increase. Hunting-ton ( 1968 ) obtained similar results by arguing that corruption should reduce the governmental interference that adversely e ﬀects those economic decisions that would be favourable for growth. Lui ( 1985 ) extended this idea by proposing that corruption should accelerate slow and rigid bureaucratic processes.However, the more classical view regarding corruption will argue that corruptactivities should not be considered a solution to government in ﬂexibility, because government in ﬂexibility was deliberately instituted in the ﬁrst place to generate opportunities to commit acts of corruption, such as extortions andbribes. Moreover, corruption should never be considered an element ofeﬃciency, because the acceleration of bureaucratic process by corrupting public management decisions will eventually decelerate average times, sincecorrupt public employees and elected politicians will bene ﬁt from this deceleration. Based on the World Bank ’s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGIs), cor- ruption is de ﬁned as the perception of the extent to which public power is exer- cised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, aswell as capture of the state by elites and private interests. This de ﬁnition is similar to that of Bayley ( 1996 ), who suggested that corruption is the abuse of a public management position for personal or third parties ’beneﬁts against those interests of society and its institutions. Other authors, such as Harch(1993 ), developed a more practical de ﬁnition based on speci ﬁc corrupt actions, such as extortion, payo ﬀs, bribery, collection of charge fees, illegal gifts, illicit contributions, tax evasion or fraud, open public robbery, nepotism,unlawful appropriation of public funds or state property, and the abuse ofpublic authority. The de ﬁnition of Harch ( 1993 ) also --- diﬀerent meanings to di ﬀerent people. As such, corruption varies greatly depend- ing on the nationality of the corrupt individual. For example, it is common for foreign entrepreneurs to pay sums of money far in excess of the nominal buildingpermit fee compared to the fees paid by local entrepreneurs. In addition to the rel-evant limitation presented by the measurement of corrupt activities, quantifyingthe real impact of corruption on society based mainly on the sum of individualcases is also very misleading. For example, which is more corrupt: to pay a restau-rant waiter an extra tip for a beachfront window table in Rio de Janeiro, to reselltickets for a baseball game in Santo Domingo, to collect bribes by a low-paid tra ﬃc oﬃcer in La Paz, or to award multi-billion-dollar military contracts for the U.S. Department of Defense? Based solely on the amount of money involved, thereshould be no doubt as to which is more corrupt. Furthermore, by using the perception of corruption and procedural bureauc- racy, we omitted other government barriers that may also in ﬂuence an aspiring entrepreneur ’s PBC. Other government barriers worth exploring include taxa- tion policy, competition policy, and transparency, among many others. Whichof the aforementioned barriers, independently or in combination, also deterentrepreneurial activity? Naturally, an extension to this research relates to nor-mative policy guidance for governments seeking to get out of the way. While thejury is still out on the e ﬃcacy of pro-entrepreneurship policy, the evidence is mounting that governments can clearly impede entrepreneurial activitythrough a range of barriers erected intentionally or unintentionally. Controlling corruption is an extremely di ﬃcult endeavour. Although strengthening governmental institutions is insu ﬃcient, it is a strong ﬁrst step in the right direction. In reference to the ‘cures ’of corruption, Tanzi ( 1998 , 587) argued the following: The greatest mistake that can be made is
funds or state property, and the abuse ofpublic authority. The de ﬁnition of Harch ( 1993 ) also includes traﬃ co fi n ﬂu- ences, acceptance of compensations and gifts, use of privileged information,and any other activity that in ﬂuences the political system with the objective of obtaining bene ﬁts, either personal or for groups of interests. This study de ﬁnes corruption using the theoretical lenses of political science and economics. In contrast, procedural bureaucracy is measured from the per-spective of public administration (i.e. the number of procedures required to starta business), while entrepreneurial activity is de ﬁned based on the management and business literatures. According to Shane and Venkataraman ( 2000 , 218), entrepreneurship is the process and the set of enterprising individuals who dis-cover (or create), evaluate, exploit, and respond to situational cues and existingsources of opportunity. Essentially, entrepreneurship is the nexus of twophenomena: the work of entrepreneurs and the presence of lucrative opportu-nities (Shane and Venkataraman 2000 , 218). Using the Global Entrepreneurial Monitor dataset, this study measures entrepreneurial activity from two dimen-sions: total early-stage entrepreneurial activity (TEA) and high-growth expec-tation (i.e. high-aspiration) entrepreneurial activity (HAE). HAE is aINTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS 527
percentage of TEA ventures that have better opportunities to grow as measured by the number of employees. Consistent with how Shane ( 2009 ) implores policy- makers to shift their attention and resources towards high-potential and high-growth ventures, the focus of the study is on high-growth entrepreneurs,instead of on the opportunity-driven versus necessity-driven entrepreneurshipdichotomy. There are many reasons an individual may choose to become an entrepre- neur. In the past several decades, entrepreneurship researchers have chosen todiﬀerentiate necessity-driven entrepreneurs from opportunity-driven entrepre- neurs (Williams 2009 ). Necessity-driven entrepreneurship emerges when indi- viduals have no job prospects; consequently, they start a business as the onlyalternative to unemployment. In contrast, opportunity-driven entrepreneurship occurs when individuals identify a new and pro ﬁtable business opportunity (Lecuna, Cohen, and Chávez 2017 , 143 –144). According to Shane ( 2009 ), however, the signi ﬁcant attention invested in di ﬀerentiating between opportu- nity- and necessity-driven entrepreneurship is misguided, which is principally justiﬁ ed by the assertion that the distinction between opportunity- and neces- sity-driven entrepreneurship does not exist, since entrepreneurs can buildhigh-growth, job-creating, wealth-generating ventures even if their motivationfor starting a business is out of sheer necessity (Shane 2009 ). Moreover, most opportunity-driven entrepreneurs have founded businesses that have more incommon with self-employment than with the creation of high-growth compa-nies (Lecuna and Chávez 2018 ,3 3 –34) and ‘are not interested in growing their businesses, and fewer still manage to do so ’(Shane 2009 , 142), whereas necessity-driven entrepreneurs have strong growth potential based on the neces-sity to survive as a motivation for successful entrepreneurship (Lecuna 2019 , 13). In the next section, we provide an overview of the TPB from an
entrepreneurship (Lecuna 2019 , 13). In the next section, we provide an overview of the TPB from an applied psychological lens and its application to entrepreneurship research. We thenreview the evolving literatures on both corruption (political science) and pro-cedural bureaucracy (public administration) in independently a ﬀecting entre- preneurship (management science) in regions around the globe. This is followed by the formal development of three hypotheses. We then detail our data sources and present our methodology for testing the hypotheses. We con-clude with a discussion of the results and the implications of our ﬁndings on TPB and potential avenues for future research. 2. Literature review 2.1. TPB in entrepreneurship research The TPB was developed as an extension to Ajzen and Fishbein ’s(1980 ) prior theory development known as the Theory of Reasoned Action. TPB has been applied to a range of social science disciplines and has generally been found528 A. LECUNA ET AL. --- to have strong predictive capabilities. In a meta-study of the accumulated results of the application of the TPB across 185 studies published through 1997, Armi-tage and Conner ( 2001 ) found that TPB accounted for 39% of the variation in intentions and 27% of the variation in behaviour. In entrepreneurship research, TPB has often been leveraged to predict entre- preneurial intentions (Politis et al. 2016 ) as opposed to behaviour (Kautonen, Gel- deren, and Fink 2013 ). Such use has occurred despite TPBs having been developed to predict intentions and behaviour, and TPB has been used for both purposes innumerous social science disciplines (Ajzen 1991 ; Armitage and Conner 2001 ). Entrepreneurship scholars have also found consistent results in predicting entre-preneurial intentions from TPB ’s belief constructs, with approximately 35% of the variation in intentions explained in TPB models (Aloulou 2016 ). Kautonen, Gel- deren, and Fink ( 2013 ) published one of the ﬁrst complete tests of TPB in entre- preneurship research by leveraging a longitudinal approach to explore therelationships between beliefs, intentions, and actions. With a sample of nearly1000 individuals in Austria and Finland between 2011 and 2012, Kautonen, Gel-deren, and Fink ( 2013 ) found that 59% of the variation in intention and 31% of the variation in action to form a venture were predicted by the TPB model. Interest-ingly, PBC, measured through survey questions associated with the capability toform a venture and perceived control of the outcome, was a signi ﬁcant factor in predicting both intention and behaviour. Early entrepreneurship traits research sought to con ﬁrm that individuals with an internal locus of control were more apt to launch new ventures. Entrepreneurshipscholars have long abandoned trying to identify universal personality traits thatpredict entrepreneurial action and success. Nevertheless, the PBC construct fromTPB has continued to show predictive capability in many
Nevertheless, the PBC construct fromTPB has continued to show predictive capability in many disciplines, includingentrepreneurship. However, entrepreneurship scholars have yet to fully determinethe full range of factors that in ﬂuence PBC in its relationship with entrepreneurial action. For this study, we are particularly interested in the relationship between twogovernmental barriers, corruption and ine ﬀective bureaucracy, which are measured for testing purposes as the perception of the degree of corruption and procedural bureaucracy. Below, we will provide a brief literature review of the extant research pertaining to corruption, procedural bureaucracy, and entrepreneurship. 2.2. Corruption and entrepreneurship Exogenous variables can in ﬂuence an individual ’s attitudes and moderate the relationship between entrepreneurial intentions and behaviour (Krueger,Reilly, and Carsrud 2000 ). Government corruption and procedural bureauc- racy are two ways in which governments can inhibit entrepreneurial action. A growing body of research has argued that decreasing the level of corruption encourages entrepreneurial activity (Anokhin and Schulze 2008 ; Aidis, Estrin, and Mickiewicz 2012 ; Lecuna and Chávez 2018 ). In the absence of strong ruleINTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS 529
enforcement –which is a common trait of highly corrupt governments –it becomes risky to rely on legal contracts and/or the goodwill of service providers (Alchian and Woodward 1988 ). Alternatives to trust as foundations of entrepre- neurship, such as a ﬀect, kinship, and/or ethnic identity, are economically inferior because they necessarily limit the size of the provider pool and exposepromising entrepreneurs to a greater risk of adverse selection. Corruption alsocreates disincentives for investment in innovation and other economic activities,with payo ﬀs that are di ﬃcult or costly to monitor because they are uncertain and/or temporally distant (Teece 1981 ). In particular, we support the speci ﬁc argument that corruption may encou- rage unproductive and destructive forms of entrepreneurship and breed negativesocietal attitudes towards entrepreneurs (Baumol 1990 ). This is mainly because corruption increases agency costs (Alchian and Woodward 1988 ), transaction costs (Luhmann 1988 ), and institutional risks for prospective entrepreneurs, forcing them to rely on one-sided trust (Anokhin and Schulze 2008 ). Thus, there are examples, such as the so-called ‘China Conundrum, ’whereby entrepre- neurs among a country ’s elite can actually bene ﬁt from a corrupt system (Bhoothalingam 2012 ); we would consider this unproductive entrepreneurship and not always representative of productive or market-based entrepreneurialactivity. In contrast, better control over corruption should increase cash ﬂow reliability and allow entrepreneurs across political and economic spectra tocapture a greater share of revenue (Anokhin and Schulze 2008 ). 2.3. Ine ﬀective bureaucracy and entrepreneurship Government bureaucracy that can inhibit startup activity is associated withextensive government procedures for new ﬁrm formation and burdens associ- ated with growing a new venture, such as labour policy, credit restrictions, taxpolicy and ﬁrm closure (van Stel, Storey, and Thurik 2007 ). For --- of businesses byentrepreneurs who are unwilling to engage in corrupt practices. (Aidis, Estrin, and Mickiewicz 2012 , 122) Corruption has been observed to be negatively associated with entrepreneurial entry for three related reasons (Aidis, Estrin, and Mickiewicz 2012 ): (1) it dis- courages entrepreneurs who are unwilling to engage in corruption to advancetheir enterprise; (2) it encourages destructive forms of entrepreneurship; and(3) it can prevent businesses from growing in order to avoid governmentsextracting increased revenues and resources from the company. Referringback to the PBC construct from TPB, we therefore hypothesize that higher rates of corruption will lead to lower levels of new ﬁrm formation due to the per- ception of prospective entrepreneurs that the exogenous lack of corruption control will negatively in ﬂuence their entry and growth prospects.INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS 531
policy, credit restrictions, taxpolicy and ﬁrm closure (van Stel, Storey, and Thurik 2007 ). For this research, we are particularly interested in the extant literature pertaining to the relation-ship between the number of government procedures imposed on startups andthe rate of startups in a country. The number of procedures and lengths of time required to start a ﬁrm in countries around the globe varies widely. To meet government requirements for starting to operate a business in Mozambique, an entrepreneur must complete 19 procedures taking at least 149 business days and pay US $256 in fees. To do the same, an entrepreneur in Italy needs to follow 16 di ﬀerent pro- cedures, pay US$3946 in fees, and wait at least 62 business days to acquire the necessary permits. In contrast, an entrepreneur in Canada can ﬁnish the process in two days by paying US$280 in fees and completing only two procedures. (Djankov et al. 2002,1 ) In contrast to theoretical expectations, van Stel, Storey, and Thurik ( 2007 ) did notﬁnd a relationship between the number of procedures for startups and the rate of nascent entrepreneurship. van Stel, Storey, and Thurik ( 2007 ) did530 A.

however ﬁnd that higher capital requirements for startups was negatively corre- lated with the rate of nascent entrepreneurship. Although more procedures for startups should intuitively have a negative e ﬀect on startup activity in a country, the extant research on the topic has been inconclusive. A primary objective ofthis study is to clarify the impact that higher numbers of procedures have onstartup activity rates across countries. 3. Hypotheses We have developed three hypotheses in order to determine if two di ﬀerent forms of government barriers serve independently or collectively to hinder new ﬁrm formation. Below we develop the hypotheses, present our data and methodology, interpret the results, and discuss implications for TPB and entrepreneurshippolicy research. While Krueger, Reilly, and Carsrud ( 2000 ) posited that exogen- ous variables would be weak predictors of entrepreneurial activity, our hypoth-eses predict that the perceived loss of behaviour control associated withincreasing corruption and ineﬀ ective bureaucracy will be signi ﬁcantly associated with decreased rates of entrepreneurship. 3.1. Hypothesis 1: corruption and rates of nascent entrepreneurship As discussed previously, corruption rates in a country have been found to benegatively associated with entrepreneurship behaviour. Prior results are con-sistent with what would be expected utilizing TPB and, in particular, thePBC construct. TPB scholars have found that individuals with high degrees of self-e ﬃcacy may be deterred from acting on their intentions towards a new behaviour if they perceive that exogenous factors limit their volitional control (Ajzen 2002 ). A corrupt environment distorts entrepreneurial opportunities and returns: it facili- tates the development of entrepreneurs willing and able to engage in corrupt prac- tices while acting as a barrier that hinders the entry or growth of businesses byentrepreneurs who are unwilling to engage in corrupt practices. (Aidis, Estrin, and
Hypothesis 1: Increasing corruption will decrease the probability that individuals engage in early-stage entrepreneurial activities. 3.2. Hypothesis 2: ine ﬀective bureaucracy and rates of nascent entrepreneurship As discussed previously, governments may also ‘get in the way ’of entrepre- neurial action by having high barriers to startup through bureaucratic pro- cedures for ﬁrm formation. In a highly cited study of procedural bureaucracy in 85 countries, Djankov et al. ( 2002 ) found that procedural bureaucracy led to several negative outcomes for aspiring entrepreneurs andthe economy. van Stel, Storey, and Thurik ( 2007 ) suggested that aspiring nascent-stage entrepreneurs would be more likely to be deterred by govern-mental barriers to entry more than by barriers. van Stel, Storey, and Thurik(2007 ) identiﬁ ed several potential government deterrents of new ﬁrm for- mation, including minimum capital requirements, labour market regulations,and procedural bureaucracy. Contrary to van Stel, Storey, and Thurik ’s(2007 )ﬁndings, and consistent with Djankov et al. ( 2002 ), we posit that the number of procedures required for ﬁrm formation, which we have referred to as procedural bureaucracy, will in factdeter new ﬁrm formation. Because procedural bureaucracy is an exogenous factor outside the control of the entrepreneur, the PBC associated with thisaspect of ﬁrm formation is low and can result in impeding the relationship between an entrepreneur ’s intentions and their behaviour, as represented by the formalization of their new ﬁrm. Hypothesis 2: Ine ﬀective bureaucracy, captured by higher rates of procedural bureauc- racy, will decrease the probability that individuals engage in early-stage entrepreneur- ial activities. 3.3. Hypothesis 3: combined e ﬀects of increasing corruption and ine ﬀective bureaucracy on new ﬁrm formation The two constructs tied to our ﬁrst two hypotheses, corruption and procedural bureaucracy, have been linked to each other in the extant policy
corruption and procedural bureaucracy, have been linked to each other in the extant policy literature. Djankov et al. ( 2002 ) introduced the tollbooth hypothesis, which suggested that higher procedural bureaucracy leads directly to increased corruption as gov-ernment oﬃ cials oﬀ er to ‘grease the wheels ’in return for ﬁnancial compensation. A direct implication of the tollbooth hypothesis is that corruption levels and the inten- sity of entry regulation are positively correlated. In fact, since in many countries in our sample politicians run businesses, the regulation of entry produces the double bene ﬁt of corruption revenues and reduced competition for the incumbent businesses already aﬃliated with the politicians. (Djankov et al. 2002 , 26)532 A. LECUNA ET AL.
This interconnection between corruption and procedural bureaucracy has been conﬁrmed in follow-up studies of the tollbooth hypothesis (Guriev 2004; Ahlin and Bose 2007). Surprisingly, however, the two constructs of corruption and pro- cedural bureaucracy have rarely been incorporated into empirical studies withregard to their combined e ﬀects on startup rates (Djankov 2009). As the tollbooth hypothesis demonstrates, corruption and procedural bureaucracy combine toform an even more insurmounicic barrier to new ﬁrm formation. This barrier, when perceived by aspiring nascent entrepreneurs, would even further lowerthe entrepreneur ’sP B Co fn e w ﬁrm formation. We suggest that the mixed results pertaining to the impact of the number of procedures on startup ratesreported in earlier studies may be due to the lack of empirical examination ofthe connection between procedures and corruption. Leveraging PBC, it is reason- able to expect that the combination of corruption and procedural bureaucracy leads to reduced control beliefs of entrepreneurs, resulting in further detrimentalimpacts on startup rates. Therefore, we hypothesize the following. Hypothesis 3: Corruption rates and levels of procedural bureaucracy combine to further lower rates of entrepreneurial activity 4. Methodology Because our data feature a hierarchical structure –namely, individual and country-year levels –we apply a multilevel approach to test our hypotheses. Our source for individual-level data derives from the global entrepreneurship monitor (GEM) adult population survey (APS), which covers a representativesample of the population in each participant country (Autio, Pathak, and Wenn- berg 2013 ). We use data from the 10-year period 2006 –2015. Our analysis includes 53 countries 1and covers responses from 725,153 individuals. Data for country-year variables were gathered from the WGI and the World Economic Forum ’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). While other studies employ data from the Heritage --- important factors out of their control that may negatively a ﬀect their ability to actually incorporate a new ﬁrm. All three of our hypotheses were con ﬁrmed to some degree: corruption is associated with lower rates of total entrepreneurial activity (H1); ine ﬀective bureaucracy, as measured by the number of procedures required of a startup, is associated with lower rates of high-aspiration entrepreneurial activity (H2);and procedural bureaucracy moderates the relationship between corruptionand total entrepreneurial activity (H3). These conclusions are consistent withprior conceptual work by Djankov et al. ( 2002 ) and later empirical work explor- ing the tollbooth hypothesis as it pertains to the relationship between corruptionand procedural bureaucracy (Guriev 2004 ; Ahlin and Bose 2007 ). However, we cannot fully support our three hypotheses, because corruption was not signi ﬁcant in the HAE speci ﬁcation; moreover, procedural bureaucracy enters the TEA speci ﬁcation with a highly signi ﬁcant negative sign, indicating that as procedural bureaucracy increases, it becomes likely that more formalentrepreneurs will consider informal startups, which is likely captured by theTEA measurements from the GEM (Valdez and Richardson 2013 ). Similarly, though we were able to con ﬁrm that corruption and procedural bureaucracy jointly have a greater detrimental impact on TEA, we were not able to fullyextend prior research by ﬁnding a signi ﬁcant interaction e ﬀect between high levels of corruption and procedural bureaucracy as they pertain to HAE. While the link between corruption and entrepreneurial activity has been conﬁrmed consistently in the extant literature (Aidis, Estrin, and Mickiewicz 2012 ), the role of ine ﬀective bureaucracy, independently or jointly with corrup- tion, had yet to be clearly con ﬁrmed in prior research. Given the largely incon- clusive or inconsistent results found in numerous studies of pro-entrepreneurship policy and the rates or quality of
Forum ’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). While other studies employ data from the Heritage Foundation/Wall Street Journal to measure institutional factors (see Aidis, Estrin, and Mickiewicz2012; McMullen, Bagby, and Palich 2008), including ‘freedom from corrup- tion, ’as key variables of interest, the dataset presented here uses the World Bank ’s measurement for government institutions based on the WGI, as suggested by Djankov et al. (2002). As in many other studies, including Acsand Amorós ( 2008) ,w eu s et h eG C It om e a s u r et h ec o m p e t i t i v e n e s sf a c t o r s , whereas the macroeconomic control variables were drawn from the IMFWorld Economic Outlook (WEO) database. 1Sample: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Czech Rep., Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Rep. of Korea, Latvia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Algeria, Bosniaand Herzegovina, Brazil, Colombia, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Turkey, Uruguay, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Morocco, the Philippines, and Thailand.INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS 533 --- as a percentage of the labour force), inﬂation (percentage change in average con- sumer prices), investment (total investment as a percentage of GDP), and savings (gross national savings as a percentage of GDP) are included to re ﬂect the soundness of a country ’s monetary policy. All the macroeconomic variables are measured using the WEO database. The WEO database contains selected macroeconomic data series from the statistical appendix of the WEO report.To capture the in ﬂuences of additional institutional factors, we use variables drawing from the WGI and GCI. The WGI measurements report on broadcharacteristics of government institutions, including political stability ,infra- structure ,capacity of innovation , and wageﬂexibility . 4.2. Estimation technique Because we use two levels of analysis (the individual and country levels), weanalyse the data using hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) methods. Multilevelmodelling is appropriate when data are hierarchically structured –that is, when they consist of units grouped at di ﬀerent levels of a hierarchy (Aguinis, Gottfred- son, and Culpepper 2013 ; Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal 2006 ). Autio, Pathak, and Wennberg ( 2013 ) recommend the use of a multilevel approach in studies of institutions and entrepreneurship, and they encourage GEM data entrepreneur-ship research to use this technique. Thus, we estimate a model speci ﬁed by the following equation (Equation (1)): Y ijt=b0+b1−2Country pred jt+b3−9Indiv controls ijt +b10−11Country controls jt+mijt+1jt, where Yijtrepresents the dependent variables (TEA or HAE); Country pred jt represents the country predictors; Indiv controls ijtrepresents the individual controls; and Country controls jtrepresents the country control variables. (Table 2 presents the correlations among the controls, predictors, and dependent variables). The combination of mijt+1jtcomprises the random part of the equation, where 1jtrepresents the country-level residuals, and mijtrepresents the
4.1. Measures 4.1.1. Individual-level dependent variables We use two dependent variables to test our hypothesis: the ﬁrst is the early-stage entrepreneur (TEA), and the second is a subset of the early-stage entrepreneurs who are involved in a high-growth-expectation venture (HAE). TEA is based on the life cycle of the entrepreneurial process, which covers nascent entrepreneurswho have taken some action to create a new business in the past year but havenot paid any salaries or wages in the last three months, or the owners/managersof businesses that have paid wages and salaries for more than three months butless than 42 months. TEA is composed of both opportunity-driven entrepre-neurship as well as necessity-based entrepreneurship. While some scholarshave sought to distinguish these metrics in studying rates of entrepreneurship,others have argued that the distinction is largely irrelevant because ‘people can build high-growth, job-creating, wealth-generating companies even iftheir motivation for starting a business was necessity ’(Shane 2009 , 142). HAE considers the high-aspiration ventures that are part of the TEA. HAE is thusdeﬁned by entrepreneurs who expect to employ at least 5 employees 5 years from now. HAE is negatively correlated with TEA. In our results section, wefurther interpret the relationship between our hypotheses and the twodiﬀerent dependent variables identi ﬁed in this section. 4.1.2. Country-level predictors Corruption. The corruption indicator (CORR) is the inverse value of ‘control of corruption, ’which is drawn from the WGI. We transformed this variable so that the sign would be harmonized; moreover, for ease of interpretation, we centredthe variable on zero. CORR re ﬂects the perception of the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of cor-ruption, as well as capture of the state by elites and private interests. Theexpected direction of the corruption coe ﬃcient in the regression models --- part of the equation, where 1jtrepresents the country-level residuals, and mijtrepresents the individual-level residuals. 5. Results Table 3 reports the results from estimating Equation (1) for two measures of entrepreneurial activity. The ﬁrst interesting point to highlight is that di ﬀerent measurements of entrepreneurship are a ﬀected in di ﬀerent ways, which was expected, because HAE tends to capture registered ﬁrms with high-growth aspirations. The main focus in Table 3 is the e ﬀect of the degree of corruption and ine ﬀective bureaucracy measured by the number of procedures required to start a business.536 A. LECUNA ET AL.
and private interests. Theexpected direction of the corruption coe ﬃcient in the regression models is nega- tive, which implies that higher levels of corruption negatively a ﬀects entrepre- neurial activity. Following Lecuna ( 2012 , 144), we tested the ‘control of corruption ’variable as a valid country-level predictor against four potential endogenous factors from the 2008 –2009 GCI: property rights, strength of audit- ing and reporting standards, judicial independence, and reliability of police ser-vices. The correlation coe ﬃcients between the ﬁve measures, including the ‘control of corruption ’indicator, ranged anywhere from .76 to .96, which was expected due to all simply being variants of a lack of corruption. Procedural bureaucracy. The information for the second independent variable of interest, the number of procedures required to start a business, or procedural bureaucracy, is measured using the GCI. The World Economic Forum ’s Global Competitiveness report remains the most comprehensive worldwide assessment of national competitiveness, providing a platform for dialogue between534 A. LECUNA ET AL.
government, business, and civil society about the actions required to improve economic prosperity. In line with the ‘H2’hypothesis, procedural bureaucracy is expected to enter the regression model with a strongly negative sign, indicatingthat fewer bureaucratic procedures lead to increased entrepreneurial activity. 4.1.3. Individual-level control variables Following previous research (see, for example, Arenius and Minniti 2005 ), we include four perceptual variables that have been linked to entrepreneurial beha-viours as proxies of (1) social capital within the entrepreneurial ecosystem, (2) the individual ’s perceived self-eﬃcacy in entrepreneurial e ﬀorts, (3) the fear of failure when undertaking new business venture activities, and (4) opportunity recognition ,r eﬂecting the individual ’s alertness to opportunities. We also include demographic characteristics, such as age,sexand level of education . These variables were obtained from the GEM APS data. Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the variables used in the empirical exercise at the individ-ual and the country levels of analysis. 4.1.4. Country-level control variables Drawing from prior studies of rates of entrepreneurship, we employ a series ofmacroeconomic indicators as control variables for testing our hypotheses. Theﬁrst macroeconomic explanatory variable is the Gross Domestic Product percapita ( GDP ), as expressed in current U.S. dollars per person. Log GDP per capita values are used to better interpret the GDP per capita explanatory variablein the regression models and to avoid excessive weighting of extremely high andlow observations.

provides reasonably good explanatory power for entrepreneurial activity when judged by the usual t-test of signi ﬁcance. This ﬁnding provides support for the ‘H1’hypothesis, which speci ﬁcally tests whether higher levels of corruption in a country have a negative and signi ﬁcant impact on total entrepreneurial activity. However, in the case of HAE in Column 3, we do not ﬁnd a signi ﬁcant coeﬃcient. 5.2. Hypothesis 2: relationship between procedural bureaucracy and entrepreneurial activity In the case of procedural bureaucracy, the impact of more bureaucracy in entre- preneurial activity is signi ﬁcant in all the speci ﬁcations, but the direction of the eﬀect is di ﬀerent when comparing the di ﬀerent de ﬁnitions of entrepreneurial activity. HAE is negatively associated with more bureaucracy( b=−0.0311; p,0.01), whereas TEA is positively related (b=0.0591; p,0.01). An additional procedure to start a business reduces the HAE by approximately 3%. Conversely, as TEA likely also includes largenumbers of informal ventures, the increase in levels of bureaucracy could even-tually become an additional exogenous barrier leading aspiring entrepreneurs toavoid formality. Therefore, in the case of TEA, more procedural bureaucracyincreases the percentage of informal entrepreneurs. 5.3. Hypothesis 3: interaction e ﬀects between corruption and procedural bureaucracy The interaction term between corruption and procedural bureaucracy isreported in Table 3 (Columns 2 and 4) for all the de ﬁnitions of entrepreneurial activity. We ﬁnd this interaction e ﬀect to be signi ﬁcant only for the TEA deﬁnition of entrepreneurial activity ( b=−0.0033; p,0.01), which implies that the combination of high corruption and relatively greater proceduresrequired to start a business provides an additional boost to total entrepreneurialactivity over and above the direct e ﬀects. 6. Limitations, discussion, and future research This research draws on panel data from 53 economies to empirically test three
and future research This research draws on panel data from 53 economies to empirically test three hypotheses derived from TPB. Speci ﬁcally, we set out to determine the relationships among corruption, procedural bureaucracy, and two measuresof entrepreneurial activity (TEA and HAE) in 53 countries around theglobe. We were particularly intereste d in the application of PBC from TPB, which suggests that entrepreneurs who may otherwise be inclined (entrepre-neurial intention) to start a new ﬁrm and who believe they are capable of doing so may choose not to act on those intentions because there areINTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS 539
results found in numerous studies of pro-entrepreneurship policy and the rates or quality of entrepreneurial activity, webelieve our results contribute to the conversation about the diﬀ erent positive and negative roles governments may play in a ﬀecting the entrepreneurial phenomenon in their country or region. These results suggest new lines of research related to governmental barriers to entrepreneurship in the context of TPB. Longitudinal studies, similar to that ofKautonen, Gelderen, and Fink ( 2013 ), using the same or expanded government barrier indicators could allow for deeper insights into the relationship betweenintentions and behaviour. Due to our reliance on secondary data, we were unableto test a full TPB model that could capture data from aspiring entrepreneurs atthe concept stage and explore which aspects of TPB and PBC a ﬀected the relationship between initial intention and eventual action or inaction. Measuring corruption also presents a signi ﬁcant challenge. Because corruption is a criminal activity, methodologies measuring it must be sustained on the sub-jective perceptions re ﬂected in questionnaires and surveys, which distorts any possibility of achieving precise measurements. Moreover, the intrinsic problemwith relying on the perception of corruption is that corruption itself has540 A. LECUNA ET AL.
’of corruption, Tanzi ( 1998 , 587) argued the following: The greatest mistake that can be made is to rely on a strategy that depends excessively on actions in a single area, such as increasing the salaries of the public sector employ-ees, or increasing penalties, or creating an anticorruption oﬃ ce, and then to expect quick results. However, decreasing the number of procedures required to start a business is a relatively straightforward public policy measure. Therefore, this research has important policy implications, because the theory and evidence presented here indicate that stimulating entrepreneurial activity in an economy is moreeﬀective when policy reforms aimed at better control over corruption are implemented in combination with decreasing bureaucratic procedures. Finally, one of the contributions of this research is its use of two di ﬀerent measures of entrepreneurial activity. As highlighted in the Results section, wefound unique and sometimes con ﬂicting results regarding the relationship between corruption and procedural bureaucracy on startup activity, dependingon which of the two measures was utilized (TEA versus HAE). As Valdez andRichardson ( 2013) suggested, further research is needed to understand theINTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS 541
unique role informal entrepreneurship plays in studies of entrepreneurship activity. We found that TEA was associated with signi ﬁcantly di ﬀerent behaviour with respect to procedural bureaucracy. Perhaps one reason for entrepreneurshipscholars ’inability to obtain consistent results in studies of entrepreneurship activity is the lack of consistency in the dependent variable chosen. 7. Conclusion There is growing consensus that corruption is an impediment to entrepreneurship (Anokhin and Schulze 2008; Aidis, Estrin, and Mickiewicz 2012; Acs, Desai, and Flapper 2008). With regard to ine ﬀective bureaucracy and new ﬁrm formation, however, results have been mixed (van Stel, Storey, and Thurik 2007). Further- more, despite the logical connections between corruption and bureaucracy,these constructs have rarely been related in empirical studies of government impe-diments to entrepreneurship (Estrin, Korosteleva, and Mickiewicz 2013). The focus of this research was to clarify the roles of corruption and ine ﬀective bureaucracy as they pertain to government barriers to entrepreneurship, therebyextending our understanding of control beliefs within the TPB. In this research,we developed three hypotheses. The ﬁrst two sought to clarify the roles of cor- ruption and procedural bureaucracy as independent constructs a ﬀecting entre- preneurial activity in an economy. The third hypothesis sought to relate the twoconstructs to each other in order to determine if there is an interaction e ﬀect between corruption and procedural bureaucracy as a combined factoraﬀecting entrepreneurship activity in a region. We obtained data from several sources in support of this research (GEM, WGI, and GCI). The evidence is mounting that government barriers can a ﬀect the relationship between an aspiring entrepreneur ’s intention to start a ﬁrm and their eventual behaviour. This study contributes to the ongoing conversation about demon-strating a linkage between corruption, procedural bureaucracy,
the ongoing conversation about demon-strating a linkage between corruption, procedural bureaucracy, and entrepre-neurial activity. In all, our ﬁndings suggest direct policy implications: reducing ine ﬀective bureaucracy in ﬂuences individuals ’engagement in high- quality entrepreneurship. Policymakers could implement simple regulatorychanges that can facilitate business development, such as cutting bureaucraticred tape or eliminating unnecessary procedures for ﬁrm creation. Alleviating corruption is a more di ﬃcult endeavour, but initiatives that increase the states’ modernization, transparency, and accountability have been implemented successfully, for example, in some Latin American countries with the support ofthe Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). It is quite possible that Baumol ( 1990 ) and Shane ( 2009 ) are correct in arguing that pro-entrepreneurial policy may not increase the number or quality of entrepreneurs but instead that bad government may impede otherwise promising startups from ever getting o ﬀthe ground. We believe this to be a fertile area for future research.542 A. LECUNA ET AL.

El artículo "Want more high-growth entrepreneurs? Then control corruption with less ineffective bureaucracy" de Antonio Lecuna, Boyd Cohen y Vesna Mandakovic, examina la interrelación entre la corrupción, la burocracia ineficaz y la actividad emprendedora, enfatizando cómo las políticas públicas pueden influir en el emprendimiento. Los autores, provenientes de instituciones académicas en Chile y España, argumentan que, además de fomentar el emprendimiento, los gobiernos pueden crear obstáculos que dificultan la creación de nuevas empresas.

### Contexto y Metodología
El estudio se centra en la corrupción como un desincentivador de la actividad emprendedora, utilizando la teoría del comportamiento planificado (TPB) y el constructo de control conductual percibido (PBC). A través de un análisis de datos de individuos de 53 países entre 2006 y 2015, los autores investigan cómo la corrupción y la burocracia ineficaz afectan las tasas de participación en el emprendimiento, tanto de manera independiente como conjunta.

### Hallazgos Clave
Los resultados confirman que tanto la corrupción como la burocracia ineficaz están negativamente asociadas con las tasas de actividad emprendedora. En contextos de alta corrupción, se observa una interacción entre estos factores que resulta en una disminución aún mayor de la actividad emprendedora. Esto sugiere que reducir la corrupción y mejorar la eficiencia burocrática son esenciales para crear un entorno más favorable al emprendimiento.

### Importancia de las Políticas de Emprendimiento
El artículo destaca la relevancia de las políticas de emprendimiento en el crecimiento del empleo y la competitividad de los países, citando investigaciones que demuestran que un mayor nivel de emprendimiento puede contribuir significativamente a estos aspectos. Sin embargo, se señala que los resultados sobre el impacto de las políticas gubernamentales en el fomento de un emprendimiento más productivo son variados y, en muchos casos, poco concluyentes.

### Teoría de Baumol y Contribuciones de los Autores
William Baumol sugiere que las políticas públicas pueden no ser efectivas para aumentar el número de emprendedores, lo que plantea dudas sobre la efectividad de las estrategias gubernamentales. Los autores, Lecuna, Cohen y Mandakovic, aportan sus perspectivas sobre cómo la corrupción y la burocracia afectan el emprendimiento, cada uno con un enfoque en sus respectivas áreas de investigación.

### Barreras Gubernamentales y Emprendimiento
El texto también aborda cómo las políticas gubernamentales pueden imponer obstáculos a la actividad emprendedora. Investigaciones previas sugieren que diversas barreras, como restricciones legales y altos impuestos, están negativamente correlacionadas con la actividad de startups. Además, se discute la necesidad de investigar cómo estas barreras pueden desalentar el emprendimiento.

### Teoría del Comportamiento Planeado (TPB)
La TPB se utiliza como marco conceptual para analizar los datos relacionados con el emprendimiento. Esta teoría postula que las intenciones de un individuo para actuar están influenciadas por creencias comportamentales, normativas y de control. A lo largo de las décadas, se ha aplicado en el ámbito del emprendimiento para comprender mejor las intenciones y comportamientos de los emprendedores.

### Relación entre Corrupción y Burocracia
El texto destaca la compleja relación entre la corrupción y la eficiencia gubernamental, presentando diversas perspectivas sobre cómo la corrupción puede influir en la toma de decisiones económicas y en el funcionamiento de las instituciones públicas. Se argumenta que la corrupción puede desincentivar la inversión en innovación y otras actividades económicas, generando actitudes sociales negativas hacia los emprendedores.

### Implicaciones para Políticas Públicas
El estudio concluye que controlar la corrupción y reducir la burocracia ineficaz son pasos cruciales para estimular el surgimiento de emprendedores de alto crecimiento, lo que podría tener un impacto positivo en la economía de los países analizados. Se sugiere que las reformas políticas deben centrarse en la simplificación de los procedimientos burocráticos y en el fortalecimiento de las instituciones para fomentar un entorno más propicio para el emprendimiento.

### Conclusiones
El artículo presenta un análisis multifacético de la corrupción, la burocracia y la actividad emprendedora, subrayando la necesidad de más investigación y análisis empírico para identificar qué políticas son realmente efectivas en la promoción del emprendimiento. Se enfatiza que, aunque la corrupción y la burocracia son barreras significativas, un enfoque en la reducción de estas puede facilitar un entorno más favorable para el emprendimiento y, en última instancia, contribuir al crecimiento económico.
