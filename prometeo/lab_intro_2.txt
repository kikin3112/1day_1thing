Evaluating the effectiveness of a laboratory-based professional development program for science educators. Adv Physiol Educ 39: 341–351, 2015; doi:10.1152/advan.00088.2015.—The process of de-veloping effective science educators has been a long-standing objec-tive of the broader education community. Numerous studies haverecommended not only depth in a teacher’s subject area but also abreadth of professional development grounded in constructivist prin-ciples, allowing for successful student-centered and inquiry-basedinstruction. Few programs, however, have addressed the integration ofthe scientiﬁc research laboratory into the science classroom as a viableapproach to professional development. Additionally, while occasionallaboratory training programs have emerged in recent years, many lacka component for translating acquired skills into reformed classroominstruction. Given the rapid development and demand for knowledge-able employees and an informed population from the biotech andmedical industries in recent years, it would appear to be particularlyadvantageous for the physiology and broader science education com-munities to consider this issue. The goal of this study was to examinethe effectiveness of a laboratory-based professional development program focused on the integration of reformed teaching principlesinto the classrooms
development program focused on the integration of reformed teaching principlesinto the classrooms of secondary teachers. This was measured throughthe program’s ability to instill in its participants elevated academicsuccess while gaining fulﬁllment in the classroom. The ﬁndingsdemonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement in the use of student-centeredinstruction and other reformed methods by program participants aswell as improved self-efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, and job satisfaction. Alsorevealed was a reluctance to refashion established classroom proto-cols. The combination of these outcomes allowed for construction ofan experiential framework for professional development in appliedscience education that supports an atmosphere of reformed teaching inthe classroom. science education; professional development; reformed teaching; lab- oratory training EMPHASIS on educator implementation of teaching strategies using constructivist principles in science instruction has in-creased dramatically in recent years (7, 13 19, 44). Speciﬁcally,inquiry-based learning focused on student-led discussion withcritical thinking methods has been shown to improve bothstudent efﬁcacy and performance (5, 10, 14, 39). Reﬁnement ofconstructivist teaching includes methods for promoting devel-opment of logical thinking and applied cognitive, affective, andpsychomotor skills by implementing student-centered, student-directed learning.Reformed teaching is deﬁned as an approach to inquiry- based learning that asserts teaching should be “consistent withthe nature of scientiﬁc inquiry” (4). Teachers who engage inthis type of instruction, reﬂecting “scientiﬁc ways of knowing,”aim to address learning anxiety and take the time to optimizelearning, extending beyond the textbook, and tapping intorelevant applications (42). Studies have found that implemen-tation of such principles in the classroom results in high levelsof academic success, including meaningful conversation, crit-ical proposition and analysis of
levelsof academic success, including meaningful conversation, crit-ical proposition and analysis of problems, and improved con-ﬁdence in their students (39, 46). The research in this reportexpands on proven and effective methods to improve studentengagement and performance as well as improve teacher efﬁ-cacy, morale, and conﬁdence as they pertain to reformedteaching principles in the physiology and broader life-scienceclassrooms (17, 41). This was accomplished by partneringlaboratory-based training and pedagogical intervention forseven high school science teachers to promote student-led andstudent-centered instructional strategies while also fosteringthe development of physiologically relevant applied life sci-ence classroom activities to enhance those strategies. Thesigniﬁcance of this approach is that while examples of profes-sional laboratory-based training opportunities that promoteexperiential tactics for teachers are known, the formal marriageof these concepts to effectively use the acquired skills forpersonal and classroom advancement and understanding is nota common practice. Constructivism and reformed teaching. Since the earliest remarks by Jean Piaget regarding the constructivist educationmovement, inquiry-based learning has been identiﬁed as ahallmark of the contemporary science classroom, focusing onthe student-led generation of questions sparked from personal experience and human-environmental connections, thereby en-hancing student interest and facilitating the development ofcritical and logical thinking skills, such as the analysis andsynthesis of evidence-based research, reﬂection, conceptualiza-tion, and application (2). The teaching of applied science notonly requires knowledge of content but also the ability tofacilitate student-led dialogue regarding observation, investi-gation, and discovery. Implementation of inquiry-based tech-niques that expand on traditional classroom practices, such asshowing rather than telling and asking students the
on traditional classroom practices, such asshowing rather than telling and asking students the big ques-tions and letting them ﬁnd their way to the answers, has beenfound to transform the learning environment (28, 56). One goalof constructivism in the science classroom is movement froma behaviorist natured action-reward model, where studentssimply follow instructions and rephrase lecture notes to meetthe criteria for an end-point grade, to a more student-centered, Address for reprint requests and other correspondence: P.

engaging, and highly inﬂuential learning experience in which the student is expected to develop a skillset not unlike that ofa laboratory research scientist. The teacher is expected tofacilitate this process through active and student-centeredlearning. Reformed teaching, combined with inquiry-based learning, is one possible approach to constructivism in the scienceclassroom. The concept of reformed teaching was introducedin 1995 by the Arizona Collaborative for Excellence in thePreparation of Teachers based on principles introduced by theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science in1989: “ 1. Teaching should be consistent with the nature of scientiﬁc inquiry, 2. Teaching should reﬂect scientiﬁc values, 3. Teaching should aim to counteract learning anxieties, 4. Science teaching should extend beyond the school, and 5. Teaching should take its time” (1, 2, 42). This pedagogicalconcept “presupposes that teachers do not emphasize lecture,but rather stress a problem-solving and active exploration” (25,42) via student-led interactive conversations, laboratory appli-cation, and awareness of current science principles. The need for such highlighted teaching practices has come to the forefront in recent years, with the National ResearchCouncil’s publication of the Framework for K-12 Science Education in 2011 and the collective publication of the Next Generation Science Standards by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council, the American Associa-tion for the Advancement of Science, and the National ScienceTeachers Association in 2013 (31, 32, 33). The NationalResearch Council (32) suggests that the three dimensions fromtheK-12 Framework (practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas) set up educators using the Next Gen- eration Science Standards for successful reformed and inquiry- based instruction through implementation of the following fourprinciples: Lessons: 1. Have broad importance across multiple sciences or engineering
following fourprinciples: Lessons: 1. Have broad importance across multiple sciences or engineering disciplines or are a key organizing principle ofa single discipline, 2. Provide key tools for understanding or investigating more complex ideas and solving problems, 3. Relate to the interests and life experiences of students or areconnected to societal or personal concerns that require scien-tiﬁc or technological knowledge, and 4. Are teachable and learnable over multiple grades at increasing levels of depth andsophistication. That is, the idea can be made accessible toyounger students but is broad enough to sustain continuedinvestigation over years. Studies have found that educators implementing reformed teaching principles in the classroom reported high levels ofmeaningful conversation, critical proposition and analysis ofproblems, and improved conﬁdence in their students resultingin documented academic success (29, 46). In the cited exam-ples, those with the most signiﬁcantly reformed instruction, asmeasured by the reformed teaching observation protocol(RTOP), enhanced the characteristics described above andfostered student-centered, inquiry-based discussion and im-proved student-teacher relationships and overall studentgrowth. Lessons producing the least reform were typicallyteacher centered, preventing students from structuring the the-oretical framework to ask questions, participate in meaningfulcommunication, and ultimately relate to the content, therebyremaining unengaged in the learning process.The need for instructional training toward reformed teaching. While some researchers fear that reformed teaching does not necessarily translate into inquiry-based instructiondue to variables such as teacher and student motivation (23,51), the studies above have demonstrated that a strong corre-lation does in fact exist between the two concepts (39, 42, 46).A more recent study by Mattheis and Murray (26) also reportedthat conceptual changes on the part of
more recent study by Mattheis and Murray (26) also reportedthat conceptual changes on the part of participating educatorsfrom teacher-centered to student-centered strategies supportedmotivational beneﬁts. To implement such teaching strategies, itis believed that educators must ﬁrst be trained on how toefﬁcaciously develop active, student-centered lessons thatprompt students to conceptualize new information through theuse of inquiry and connection to prior knowledge (3). This wasa key foundational component in the development of this studyand training program. As a result of general observation, it hasoften been reported that educators will teach using techniqueswith which they are familiar and comfortable. These are oftenapproaches that allow educators to learn best in their individuallives, even though it may not be best for students. They may beaware of alternative methodologies that have proven moresuccessful for a broader range of learning styles, but, moreoften than not, they do not have the training or conﬁdence toventure into such risky endeavors (3). Yet, it has been welldocumented in multiple studies that signiﬁcant differences instudent success outcomes between active learning and tradi-tional lecture exist and heavily favor the reformed approach(15, 16, 22, 43). By using professional development andinstructional coursework to create a learning community fo-cused on reformed teaching, educators are not only encouragedto reﬂect on teaching practices but are also provided with thetools necessary for such change. For example, teachers activelyinvolved in discussions centered on active learning and stu-dent-led conversation become more prepared and intrinsicallymotivated to implement such practices in the classroom and aresought out more often by colleagues than those known fortraditional approaches (20, 21).

Laboratory-based professional development as a means of promoting high standards in science education. Over the past several decades, a number of development programs thatpromote active and student-centered learning on the part ofteachers in the high school sciences have emerged. In the early2000s, Schwartz, Lederman, and Crawford conducted a studyin which educators served as interns in university laboratorysettings. Results indicated that participants gained a philosoph-ical appreciation for the “nature of science” and consequentlyimplemented such philosophies in their own classrooms (55).Similar programs conducted by The University of Tennessee,the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, and the ScienceFor Early Adolescence Teachers organization found that a“viable constructivist model for exposing teachers to scienceresearch and transferring that experience to the classroom” wasaccomplished (8, 29). These “apprenticeship” models in whichthe science educator gets to participate in a laboratory experi-ence, side by side with an expert scientist, allow for “the novicelearner to become an expert through the mechanism of accul-turation into the world of the expert” (8).How We Teach: Generalizable Education Research 342 EVALUATING A LABORATORY-BASED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM Advances in Physiology Education •doi:10.1152/advan.00088.2015 •http://advan.physiology.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/advances (168.176.005.118) on August 20, 2024.
From its earliest beginnings nearly 25 yr ago, the laboratory apprenticeship model of professional development has beenstrongly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF)and has collectively come to be known as the Research Expe-riences for Teachers (RET) program (40, 41). The RET Pro-gram was originally modeled to emulate the NSF ResearchExperiences of Undergraduates Program, with a goal to pro-mote interactions and professional development between sci-ence professionals in the K–12, university, private, and gov-ernment sectors (37, 40, 41). Nearly all RET programs are nowfunded through this centralized agency, and their success hasbeen well documented (12, 27, 54). With these programs inmind, it was possible to construct a foundation for the currentprogram being highlighted in this study, focusing primarily onhow they might be improved on to provide more pedagogicalinstruction for successful translation into the classroom. Research questions. In looking at the two aforementioned aspects of science education, reformed teaching and laborato-ry-based professional development, it was hypothesized that anovel marriage of the two concepts would result in an optimumfacilitation of both pedagogical and practical teacher prepared-ness for effective classroom teaching. Concepts such as activelearning, inquiry, problem solving, investigating complexideas, and providing application can all be easily attained whileworking in the laboratory. However, their translation intovaluable lessons at a level that is consistent with the middle andhigh school classroom can often be challenging. On thatpremise, the purpose of the present study was to examine alaboratory-based professional development program and itsability to facilitate the emergence of reformed teaching prin-ciples in those classrooms. This included the participants’ability to integrate advanced laboratory training, research prin-ciples, and student-led instruction into their daily lessons andto develop novel
research prin-ciples, and student-led instruction into their daily lessons andto develop novel activities for classroom implementation. Thisstudy also sought to reveal any improvements in teacherperformance, job satisfaction, conﬁdence, and self-efﬁcacyresulting from these changes upon return to the classroom. Forthe purposes of this study, self-efﬁcacy was deﬁned as theextent to which teachers believe they can instruct in a mannerthat will generate a desired outcome in their students (6). Assuch, the following research questions were examined: 1. What impact does laboratory-based professional develop- ment, which includes advanced training in laboratory tech-niques, research principles, and reformed, student-centeredmethods, have on the adoption of reformed teaching practicesand student-centered instruction by high school teachers in thescience classroom? 2. To what extent does improved teacher efﬁcacy, conﬁ- dence, and overall job satisfaction result from inquiry-basedand reformed teaching methods when they are taught during alaboratory-based professional development program? MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study used a mixed methods approach, using multiple qualitative and quantitative resources appropriate for their respectivemeasurements. Because of the small sample size, it was found that anyquantitative measurements would require signiﬁcant qualitative rein-forcement to generate an understanding of the overall educationalimpact. Given both the data-driven nature of scientiﬁc research andthe humanistic nature of education as a profession, this approach wasdeemed to be appropriate for the study. After a year-long pilot studyand Institutional Review Board approval in 2012, data were collected over a 1-yr period, from the spring of 2013 through the fall of 2013,as part of a program titled the Science Educator Research Fellowship(SERF). The SERF Program was created by Sanford Research (Sioux Falls, SD) in response to a national initiative meant to identify new
by Sanford Research (Sioux Falls, SD) in response to a national initiative meant to identify new ap-proaches for the improvement of science, technology, engineering,and mathematics (STEM) education and the teaching of 21st centuryskills (50). SERF participants were engaged with pediatric healthresearch opportunities using basic, translational, and community-based approaches as well as professional development and pedagog-ical training over a 10-wk summer session within a pediatric researchdepartment that housed a diverse number of research projects beingconducted by both MD and PdD researchers with medical and basicscience training. This method was focused on enhancing innovativelearning techniques in the classroom and creating novel approaches toapplied and experiential classroom activities while being grounded inthe program experience and reformed student-led activity. This pro-cess was further highlighted by weekly events, round table discus-sions, and research and ethics seminars, all presented by scientist-mentors, as well as pedagogical training focused on reformed teachingand inquiry-based instruction, presentations led by participants, and aculminating symposium. The long-term goal of the SERF program was to provide a mechanism for stimulating student cognition andmotivation by providing participating educators with a deeper under-standing of content, application, discussion, technique, and ethicswhile improving conﬁdence in both teaching abilities and laboratorytechniques. It was felt that the activities described above would notonly foster that stimulation, understanding, and conﬁdence but wouldalso provide unique individual experiences that would ultimatelymotivate participants to instill such changes in both their instructionalapproaches and classroom environment. An outline of the SERFprogram as well as a summary of data collected are shown in Fig. 1. Participants. Data collected for this study came from two male and ﬁve female teachers ( n/H110057,
Participants. Data collected for this study came from two male and ﬁve female teachers ( n/H110057, age: 25–47 yr) and indirectly through /H11011300 students. All participants were selected by a committee of independent scientists not speciﬁcally involved in the blind handlingof data for this research study and were placed in complementarylaboratory settings based on an examination of individual interests,experience, and laboratory availability. The criteria used for selectionincluded previous performance in the classroom as well as demon-strated need and scale of potential impacts. To begin this process, ane-mail and application were sent to all science educators in the stateof South Dakota, inviting them to apply to be part of the 10-wkprogram, and participants were selected from this pool. Analysis ofdemographic data revealed some common factors. All participantstaught in public schools within the state of South Dakota, representingan even distribution of rural ( n/H110053) and urban ( n/H110054) designations, with district populations ranging from just a few hundred to over onethousand students. These individuals displayed signiﬁcant diversity interms of professional/educational training and years of experience,including participants new to the ﬁeld of education, those in themiddle portion of their careers, and those nearing closer to the end oftheir careers. Participating educators taught multiple high school andmiddle school science courses, including Physical Science, Life Sci-ence, Biology, Advanced Biology, Anatomy and Physiology, Zool-ogy, Chemistry, Advanced Placement Chemistry, and Physical Edu-cation. Although the participants were not selected randomly, it wasfelt that the demographic described above was representative of theteaching population in the state of South Dakota and therefore couldbe considered more or less representative of that population.

compiled by independent evaluators, contracted by Sanford Research, and then assessed blindly by the authors of the present study. Thesedata encompassed both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Whilecare should be taken not to generalize too liberally from a smallsample size, it is nonetheless pertinent to the evaluation of the effectof this program on the participants described in this study. As such, alldata collection was assumed to be in the context of a case study inwhich these experimental data established correlational signiﬁcanceas it pertained to program participants. One data set was made up ofpre- and posttreatment scores based on the well-established RTOP. Asecond data set was collected through pre- and postprogram RETsurveys originally developed by SRI for use with the National ScienceFoundation RET program (34, 40, 41, 45). A supplementary sectionwas included with this survey to collect additional qualitative datafrom the participants. Finally, a third data set was composed oftranscripts and responsive ﬂow charts collected during pre- andpostprogram focus groups conducted exclusively for use in this study.For reference, a copy of each of these three instruments has beenprovided as supplementary information. 1 RTOP. The RTOP was developed by the Evaluation Facilitation Group of the Arizona Collaborative for Excellence in the Preparationof Teachers for the purpose of measuring innovative, student-cen-tered, constructivist teaching in the science classroom (36). The goalis for the RTOP to evaluate and promote the concepts of problemsolving, reasoning with proof, communication, connections, and rep-resentation, ultimately raising the standards and expectations in thescience and mathematics classroom (30). The instrument itself is a25-item assessment divided into 3 subsets: 5 items used to gaugelesson design and implementation, 10 items evaluating the content,and 10 items assessing the classroom culture. With regard to the ﬁrstsubset of questions, the
10 items assessing the classroom culture. With regard to the ﬁrstsubset of questions, the intent is to determine how well a lesson“recognizes a student’s prior knowledge and preconceptions, engageseach student as a member of the learning community, values variety in the possible solutions to problems being addressed, and allows forstudent-led discussion and direction” (36). The second subset can befurther divided into content quality and the ability of that content todevelop inquiry among classroom participants. The third and ﬁnalsubset focuses on the stimulation and climate of the classroomenvironment itself and is also broken down into two sections: com-municative interactions and student-teacher relationships (42). Interms of validity and reliability, the RTOP has been evaluated in anumber of classroom settings, including mathematics, physics, chem-istry, and biology. Assessments from three independent evaluatorstrained in proper RTOP assessment were compiled for comparison ofinterrater reliability and normalized using percent agreement as astandard. The results were estimated at an exceptionally high level forinstruments of this nature (36). Coursework and training using RTOP assessment as an instrument for measuring reformed teaching have served as a platform to facili-tate pedagogical change in numerous applications (11, 42). Forexample, observer notes from an RTOP study in 2001 noted numerous characteristics as a result of professional development, including thecatalysis of student-centered teaching and conversation in the class-room, self-reﬂective change, and improved collegial behavior (24).Explicit communication of such goals during professional trainingfosters success in the classroom by helping educators to understandand operationally deﬁne reformed teaching (24). Individuals success-fully trained in RTOP assessment have cited its use as credible,authentic, justiﬁable, and believable (24). Furthermore, its use hasbeen shown to both empower educators to

Furthermore, its use hasbeen shown to both empower educators to self-reﬂect on their practiceusing the rubric to critique their own performance as well as continueto reconceptualize those approaches while sustaining or even catalyz-ing similar practices among their colleagues through improved rela-tionships and communication (20, 24). Pre- and postprogram RET surveys. A 26-item survey, developed by SRI for review of the NSF’s RET programs, was selected andamended to include a second section for questioning of SERFparticipants on their background, experience, and beliefs regarding 1Supplemental Material for this article is available at the Advances in Physiology Education website.

their teaching practices in the classroom and their participation in the SERF program (40). Because of many distinct similaritiesbetween the NSF’s RET program and SERF program as well as thesurvey’s established validity and reliability, it was determined thatthe questionnaire would suit this study when attempting to deter-mine 1) the importance of professional development in the peda- gogical development of the subjects, 2) how the conﬁdence and personal beliefs of these educators will change while participatingin the SERF program, and 3) how school demographics, funding, and outside training will inﬂuence the teaching practices of pro-gram participants. Responses to the RET survey were subcatego-rized according to their relevance in answering either research question 1 or2and according to their support of either reformed or traditional pedagogical tendencies. A secondary survey created bySRI for the NSF RET program, known as a program evaluationsurvey, was also administered for program assessment but was notused as data for this study. Focus groups. To gain a qualitative understanding of how par- ticipating teachers perceived their ability to conﬁdently and efﬁ-caciously communicate scientiﬁc knowledge to their students, aseries of two focus groups was constructed for implementation atthe beginning and end of the program. Questions were designed toallow for open-ended responses and were used as a general ﬂowchart for discussion. To provide a frame of reference for theirresponses, each participant was provided with a response sheetcontaining 5- and 10-point Likert scales that accompanied appro-priate questions during each session. Items from the focus groupprotocol were intended to gauge how participants typically usetheir time during classroom lessons, how they perceive the satis-faction and challenges of their day-to-day jobs, the ingenuity beingused during and frequency of classroom laboratory experiences,and how they perceive their ability to educate students.
of classroom laboratory experiences,and how they perceive their ability to educate students. Theseresponses were subcategorized according to their relevance inanswering either research question 1 or2. In each case, their opinions about how the SERF program played a role in theirsuccesses and failures were also evaluated. Focus group sessionswere video recorded, transcribed, and administered by trainedemployees of Sanford Research not afﬁliated with this study. Analysis. Data were organized according to a paired and coded system, allowing for evaluation of each participant across multipledata sets, before and after treatment. Interrater reliability of allevaluative techniques was determined through a percentage ofagreement correlation before further analysis (96% agreement).Because of the small sample size and nonrandom selection ofparticipants, all data were assessed on the premise that any and alloutcomes could not be generalized but instead provided an intimatepicture that illustrated the impact and effectiveness of the SERFprogram on its participants.Categorization of data subsets for analysis of research questions 1 and2is shown in Fig. 2. In each paired-samples t-test, signiﬁcance required an /H9251-level of P/H110210.05. All numeric data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences and Microsoft Excel,whereas all transcribed data were coded and evaluated by researchersinvolved in the study. Research question 1 asks about the impact of pedagogical and/or specialized skills training (acquired during a laboratory-based profes-sional development program) on the participants’ willingness to adoptreformed teaching practices in the secondary science classroom. Threemeasures were used to analyze the correlating data. First, a one-tailedpaired-samples t-test was used to determine if there was any growth in student-centered, inquiry-based instruction as determined by RTOPanalysis, both on individual subset scores and overall scores.

Similarone-tailed paired-samples t-tests were implemented on subset scores of Likert scale responses from the RET survey and were used to assessfor speciﬁc examples of growth in speciﬁc pedagogical techniques,observations, and experiences that lend themselves to student learn-ing. In each case, effect size was determined using Cohen’s das a measure of practical (educational) signiﬁcance (9). Short-answer re-sponses from both the RET survey and focus groups were codedaccording to similar pedagogical categories for the purpose of citingspeciﬁc in-class examples. Research question 2 addresses the extent to which the treatment improved teacher efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, and overall job satisfaction.One-tailed paired-samples t-tests were used on subset scores of Likert scale responses to the RET survey and focus group to assess positivegrowth in the aforementioned areas. In each case, effect size wasdetermined using Cohen’s das a measure of practical (educational) signiﬁcance (9). Notes taken by RTOP observers were analyzed forcited evidence in the classroom. Teacher efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, andoverall job satisfaction were used as a categorical guide to code allwritten responses from each instrument to determine if individualbeliefs, backgrounds, and attitudes about teaching display similargrowth after treatment. Reformed lesson plan development. As part of the SERF program, participants were expected to generate individual classroom activitiesgrounded in reformed teaching and inquiry-based instruction. Further-more, these activities were expected to pull from inspiration generatedduring their laboratory-based research experience. As a result, activ-ities were inherently physiological and pediatric health oriented innature.

RESULTS General outcomes for evidence of reformed teaching. The ﬁrst research question examined what impact(s) laboratory-based professional development, which includes advancedtraining in laboratory technique, research principles, and inno-vative lesson plan development, had on the likelihood ofreformed teaching practices and inquiry-based learning beingadopted by the participants in their science classrooms. To thatend, the overall and subgroup RTOP scores, RET surveysubgroup scores, and mean focus group Likert scale scores ofall seven participants were analyzed. The results of eachquantitative analysis pertaining to the ﬁrst research questionare shown in Table 1. With respect to the RTOP analysis,content ( t/H110052.22, d/H110050.837, P/H110050.034), classroom culture (t/H110053.35, d/H110051.266, P/H110050.033), and overall ( t/H110052.34, d/H11005 0.847, P/H110050.033) reformed classroom instruction showed signiﬁcant improvement. This suggests that SERF participantshave modiﬁed their curriculum to provide a more effectiveapproach that allows for students to drive the instruction ratherthan the other way around. However, the results of the lessondesign and implementation analysis ( t/H110050.78, d/H110050.293, P/H11005 0.234) suggest that while overall instruction indicated progres-sion toward the desired instructional techniques, actual lessondesign did not change signiﬁcantly. This is likely the result ofteachers being “creatures of habit,” and although delivery andapproaches were strongly inﬂuenced, participants chose not toredevelop lesson plans that had proven worthy in previousyears of instruction. Observer notes from the RTOP evaluations supported the notion of improvement in the desired teaching practices uponcompletion of the program. While results varied among indi-vidual subjects, the overall results were positive toward notice-able change in student relationships and engagement in thelesson.

relationships and engagement in thelesson. Speciﬁcally, observer notes indicated a high level ofrespect and interaction in and among students and instructors,noticeable (although variable) improvement between springand fall observations, strong topics of discussion and curricu-lum content, and at least some level of reﬂection by thestudents in most cases. It was noted by all observers that thelevel of conﬁdence among SERF participants appeared toimprove signiﬁcantly upon completion of the program. Spe-ciﬁc responses included the following: •“While individual performances varied, there was a deﬁnite improvement in reformed teaching over the course of thestudy.” ( Observer 1 )•“Some teachers appeared reluctant to change their approach to lesson plans and implementation.” ( Observer 2 ) •“The content and interaction in many of the classes appeared to be functioning at a much higher level for some teachers inthe fall observations.” ( Observer 3 ) A second portion of the analysis using the RET survey results and two paired-samples t-tests followed by a measure of Cohen’s dfor effect size measured changes in classroom practices favoring reformed teaching principles or traditionalapproaches. In this case, signiﬁcant changes were not reportedfor either reformed ( t/H110051.72, d/H110050.651, P/H110050.068) or traditional ( t/H110050.35, d/H110050.134, P/H110050.368) tendencies. However, based on the medium to large effect size of thereformed measurement and near signiﬁcance, it could be sug-gested that early signs of posttreatment enhancement of in-structional techniques were present. While the statistical results of the RET survey indicated minimal evidence of improved use of reformed teaching prac-tice, promise of a belief toward that transition could be foundin the qualitative responses to part I ,items 12a–d , which asked participants to describe their recent professional developmentactivities in the context of innovative and technologicallydriven pedagogy. When asked
developmentactivities in the context of innovative and technologicallydriven pedagogy. When asked about participation in profes-sional development experiences since the SERF program, eachof the seven program participants indicated active involvementin curriculum and methodology programming geared at im-proving student questioning, invention, and engagement inSTEM areas. Thus, one could imply that these individualsshare a strong desire to improve their ability to involve studentsin approaches consistent with constructivist beliefs regardingstudent participation and direction. A quantitative analysis of focus group responses indicated no statistical signiﬁcance toward improved reformed instruc-tion ( t/H11005/H11002 0.20, d/H11005/H11002 0.077, P/H110050.577). However, qualita- tive responses to focus group questions also indicated a strongdichotomy between the desire to implement and actual imple-mentation of those teaching practices in the classroom. Whilemany of the subjects indicated an increased ability as teachersto integrate current, applied, and relevant topics into their dailyinstruction and a desire to move forward with applied activi-ties, they felt that the reluctance to fully adopt student-drivenactivities fell with their students’ inexperience in being able tosuccessfully complete assignments in which they were asked tocreate driving questions and guide the direction of the lesson.Speciﬁc responses to this topic are shown in Fig. 3.Table 1.

General outcomes for evidence of teaching efﬁcacy, conﬁ- dence, and job satisfaction. Research question 2 sought to determine what measurable effect participation in the SERFprogram had on improving teacher efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, andoverall job satisfaction. To answer that question, three separateanalyses were completed. The results of each of those analysesare shown in Table 2 for both the RET survey ( t/H110054.34, d/H11005 1.642, P/H110050.002) and focus group responses ( t/H110055.28, d/H11005 1.997, P/H110050.001) and suggest a profound impact on overall pedagogical performance. This supports the notion that teach-ers who are provided the opportunity to develop skills learnedduring professional development are much more likely toimplement those processes in the classroom. Qualitative responses to the RET survey ( part I ,items 8 and 9), which asked the participants to identify their strengths and weaknesses as a teacher, demonstrated a high level of conﬁ-dence in each participant’s ability to incorporate real-world andlaboratory-based application into their curriculum, to commu-nicate with students in a manner that is backed up by actualscientiﬁc experience, and to develop student-teacher relation-ships with those students based on their passion and enthusi-asm for their content area. Each participant also indicated astrong desire to improve on the implementation of laboratoryexperiments, problem solving, and guided inquiry in his or herclassroom. Speciﬁc responses to this line of questioning areshown in Fig. 4. Qualitative responses to the focus group indicated a vast improvement in overall teaching efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, andjob satisfaction as a result of participating in the SERF program. Comments indicated a positive outlook on eachparticipant’s ability to inspire their students to becomecurious and effective observers of the world as it pertains tosuccessful science education. As a result, participants feltthat their overall conﬁdence and job satisfaction had
education. As a result, participants feltthat their overall conﬁdence and job satisfaction had im-proved, and each indicated that they planned to continuetheir career as a science educator for the foreseeable future,although several have been offered and are pursuing sec-ondary jobs in laboratory research. A sample of their re-sponses is shown in Fig. 5. In a ﬁnal analysis, qualitative responses to the postprogram RET survey indicated that many of the SERF participants feltthat they had improved teaching efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, and jobsatisfaction as a direct result of their experience in the program.Likert scale responses pertaining to questions about beliefs inpractice and knowledge of content resulted in mean valuationsof 2.92, 3.43, and 3.14 on a four-point scale for improvedteaching efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, and job satisfaction, respec-tively. Individual statements in response to such questions areshown in Fig. 6. Lessons as artifacts of participant growth and development. As a pedagogical training exercise, SERF participants wereexpected to develop lessons inspired by their experience in theprogram. Each teacher was matched with a research mentorperforming biomedical research on pediatric health projectsspanning molecular and physiological processes across a vari-ety of cells and tissues.

based on an examination of individual interests, experience, and laboratory availability within a pediatric research depart-ment that housed a diverse number of research projects beingconducted by both MD and PdD researchers with medical andbasic science training. Examples of projects included the fol-lowing: 1) mapping protein interactions in laminopathy-related gene mutants by expressing proximity-based promiscuous bi-otin ligase fusion proteins in immortalized human cells, 2) maternal programming of fetal cardiogenesis in rats through ahigh-fat diet and gestational diabetes, 3) characterizing motile ciliary defects during organogenesis in a novel mouse mutantof primary ciliary dyskinesia, 4) hyperoxic disruption of mito- chondrial redox homeostasis in cultured alveolar epithelialcells, 5) movement performance to predict injury susceptibility in healthy athletes, and 6) maternal drinking behaviors pre- and postconception. Multiple lessons were generated by teachers asa result of their experiences that allowed for translation of thesecomplex topics into relevant and applied physiology topics forclassroom instruction, including proteomic comparisons ofbiological samples by SDS-PAGE, evaluating genetic status byPCR and gel electrophoresis, behavioral observations of organ-isms fed high-fat diets, testing exercise programs for injury riskreduction, and creating service announcements about fetalalcohol spectrum disorders. In each case, projects were pre-sented with the intent of engaging students through reformed,student-led, and inquiry-based instruction. These lessons serve Fig. 4.

as artifacts of positive growth and development of program participants and the SERF program itself. DISCUSSION Over the last quarter century, research reports pertaining to laboratory-based professional development programs have dem-onstrated outcomes that improved teacher performance, providedpractical experience, and promoted high technical science stan-dards (8, 40, 41, 52, 53, 54). While this mode of training has beenvalidated as being successful in the development of laboratoryskillsets, such attempts have mainly focused on the laboratoryexperience without including the instructional and pedagogicalintervention that would ensure translation into the classroom (35,39). Thus, a direct connection between laboratory-based profes-sional development and an improvement in instruction, basedspeciﬁcally on the unique pedagogical intervention and trainingprovided during the SERF program, has not been commonlyobserved in previous investigations. The present study illustrated that classroom instruction for SERF participants seemed to directly impact their participationin laboratory-based professional development supported bypedagogical training. This was seen in its successful translationinto inquiry-based lessons in the secondary classroom. On thebasis of the ﬁndings described above, supported by additionalevidence found in lessons developed by program participants,a number of observations can be noted regarding the state ofteacher progress in this study of reformed practices and inqui-ry-based instruction, teacher efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, and overalljob satisfaction as it pertains to their participation in the SERFprogram. Although there was evidence of a desire to resistchanges in lesson planning and design, indication of positivegrowth toward such practices could be documented on anumber of fronts. This included growth in the beliefs of SERFparticipants as well as hard evidence of student engagement,student-teacher relationships, curriculum and content selection,and
evidence of student engagement,student-teacher relationships, curriculum and content selection,and improvements in classroom culture as prescribed by theoutcomes of the RTOP evaluation. Second, it was evident thatthe SERF program had a profound positive impact on teaching efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, and job satisfaction among program par-ticipants. One could speculate that these two general ﬁndings are correlated, based on subject response and observer notes re- corded during data collection. Participants were found to haveenhanced student participation and classroom leadership byplacing the onus for educational advancement on the studentrather than the teacher, in addition to improved their overallclassroom culture by developing quality STEM curriculum,guided inquiry, and technology-driven activities upon comple-tion of the SERF program. Although teachers were found tohave some level of difﬁculty transitioning to wholly student-led instruction due to both student inﬂuence and a desire tomaintain common practice, this study did determine an in-creased belief in, and progression toward, such teaching prac-tices both in terms of delivery and student performance. How-ever, this study did not speciﬁcally determine which aspects ofthe SERF program had led to these pedagogical outcomes.Moreover, because of the small number of participants, andtherefore limited sample demographics, it would be unwise toextrapolate these ﬁndings to the general population of middleand high school science teachers without further study and alarger sample. Previous studies have indicated that the absence of novel student innovation and guided inquiry and instead the pres-ence of predetermined “cookie cutter” activity in the class-room have a negative impact on teacher attitude and per-formance (18, 47). This effect contributed to a lack ofteacher conﬁdence and efﬁcacy that ultimately led to higherattrition rates (17). These characteristics were found to beparticularly evident in rural Midwestern
rates (17). These characteristics were found to beparticularly evident in rural Midwestern communities,where teachers are often expected to teach a signiﬁcantcourse load with limited resources and were highlighted asan area in critical need of improvement (38, 48, 49). This study supports that, in the case of these seven program participants, the integration of constructivist practices, specif- Fig. 6.

ically the reformed instructional practices highlighted in this study, into a laboratory-based professional development pro-gram can have a profound positive effect on teacher efﬁcacy,conﬁdence, and overall job satisfaction. It also supported thenotion that such changes can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence onoverall classroom culture, productivity, and student engage-ment. Despite the small number of study participants, theseresults also seem to strongly suggest that professional devel-opment such as that described above can signiﬁcantly enhancethe participants’ pedagogical approaches, self-efﬁcacy, conﬁ-dence, and overall performance.

Evaluating the effectiveness of a laboratory-based professional development program for science educators. Adv Physiol Educ 39: 341–351, 2015; doi:10.1152/advan.00088.2015.—The process of de-veloping effective science educators has been a long-standing objec-tive of the broader education community. Numerous studies haverecommended not only depth in a teacher’s subject area but also abreadth of professional development grounded in constructivist prin-ciples, allowing for successful student-centered and inquiry-basedinstruction. Few programs, however, have addressed the integration ofthe scientiﬁc research laboratory into the science classroom as a viableapproach to professional development. Additionally, while occasionallaboratory training programs have emerged in recent years, many lacka component for translating acquired skills into reformed classroominstruction. Given the rapid development and demand for knowledge-able employees and an informed population from the biotech andmedical industries in recent years, it would appear to be particularlyadvantageous for the physiology and broader science education com-munities to consider this issue. The goal of this study was to examinethe effectiveness of a laboratory-based professional development program focused on the integration of reformed teaching principlesinto the classrooms
development program focused on the integration of reformed teaching principlesinto the classrooms of secondary teachers. This was measured throughthe program’s ability to instill in its participants elevated academicsuccess while gaining fulﬁllment in the classroom. The ﬁndingsdemonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement in the use of student-centeredinstruction and other reformed methods by program participants aswell as improved self-efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, and job satisfaction. Alsorevealed was a reluctance to refashion established classroom proto-cols. The combination of these outcomes allowed for construction ofan experiential framework for professional development in appliedscience education that supports an atmosphere of reformed teaching inthe classroom. science education; professional development; reformed teaching; lab- oratory training EMPHASIS on educator implementation of teaching strategies using constructivist principles in science instruction has in-creased dramatically in recent years (7, 13 19, 44). Speciﬁcally,inquiry-based learning focused on student-led discussion withcritical thinking methods has been shown to improve bothstudent efﬁcacy and performance (5, 10, 14, 39). Reﬁnement ofconstructivist teaching includes methods for promoting devel-opment of logical thinking and applied cognitive, affective, andpsychomotor skills by implementing student-centered, student-directed learning.Reformed teaching is deﬁned as an approach to inquiry- based learning that asserts teaching should be “consistent withthe nature of scientiﬁc inquiry” (4). Teachers who engage inthis type of instruction, reﬂecting “scientiﬁc ways of knowing,”aim to address learning anxiety and take the time to optimizelearning, extending beyond the textbook, and tapping intorelevant applications (42). Studies have found that implemen-tation of such principles in the classroom results in high levelsof academic success, including meaningful conversation, crit-ical proposition and analysis of --- more recent study by Mattheis and Murray (26) also reportedthat conceptual changes on the part of participating educatorsfrom teacher-centered to student-centered strategies supportedmotivational beneﬁts. To implement such teaching strategies, itis believed that educators must ﬁrst be trained on how toefﬁcaciously develop active, student-centered lessons thatprompt students to conceptualize new information through theuse of inquiry and connection to prior knowledge (3). This wasa key foundational component in the development of this studyand training program. As a result of general observation, it hasoften been reported that educators will teach using techniqueswith which they are familiar and comfortable. These are oftenapproaches that allow educators to learn best in their individuallives, even though it may not be best for students. They may beaware of alternative methodologies that have proven moresuccessful for a broader range of learning styles, but, moreoften than not, they do not have the training or conﬁdence toventure into such risky endeavors (3). Yet, it has been welldocumented in multiple studies that signiﬁcant differences instudent success outcomes between active learning and tradi-tional lecture exist and heavily favor the reformed approach(15, 16, 22, 43). By using professional development andinstructional coursework to create a learning community fo-cused on reformed teaching, educators are not only encouragedto reﬂect on teaching practices but are also provided with thetools necessary for such change. For example, teachers activelyinvolved in discussions centered on active learning and stu-dent-led conversation become more prepared and intrinsicallymotivated to implement such practices in the classroom and aresought out more often by colleagues than those known fortraditional approaches (20, 21). In developing this professionaldevelopment program, particular care was taken to ensure thatthese components were integrated into the teacher
levelsof academic success, including meaningful conversation, crit-ical proposition and analysis of problems, and improved con-ﬁdence in their students (39, 46). The research in this reportexpands on proven and effective methods to improve studentengagement and performance as well as improve teacher efﬁ-cacy, morale, and conﬁdence as they pertain to reformedteaching principles in the physiology and broader life-scienceclassrooms (17, 41). This was accomplished by partneringlaboratory-based training and pedagogical intervention forseven high school science teachers to promote student-led andstudent-centered instructional strategies while also fosteringthe development of physiologically relevant applied life sci-ence classroom activities to enhance those strategies. Thesigniﬁcance of this approach is that while examples of profes-sional laboratory-based training opportunities that promoteexperiential tactics for teachers are known, the formal marriageof these concepts to effectively use the acquired skills forpersonal and classroom advancement and understanding is nota common practice. Constructivism and reformed teaching. Since the earliest remarks by Jean Piaget regarding the constructivist educationmovement, inquiry-based learning has been identiﬁed as ahallmark of the contemporary science classroom, focusing onthe student-led generation of questions sparked from personal experience and human-environmental connections, thereby en-hancing student interest and facilitating the development ofcritical and logical thinking skills, such as the analysis andsynthesis of evidence-based research, reﬂection, conceptualiza-tion, and application (2). The teaching of applied science notonly requires knowledge of content but also the ability tofacilitate student-led dialogue regarding observation, investi-gation, and discovery. Implementation of inquiry-based tech-niques that expand on traditional classroom practices, such asshowing rather than telling and asking students the
on traditional classroom practices, such asshowing rather than telling and asking students the big ques-tions and letting them ﬁnd their way to the answers, has beenfound to transform the learning environment (28, 56). One goalof constructivism in the science classroom is movement froma behaviorist natured action-reward model, where studentssimply follow instructions and rephrase lecture notes to meetthe criteria for an end-point grade, to a more student-centered, Address for reprint requests and other correspondence: P.

engaging, and highly inﬂuential learning experience in which the student is expected to develop a skillset not unlike that ofa laboratory research scientist. The teacher is expected tofacilitate this process through active and student-centeredlearning. Reformed teaching, combined with inquiry-based learning, is one possible approach to constructivism in the scienceclassroom. The concept of reformed teaching was introducedin 1995 by the Arizona Collaborative for Excellence in thePreparation of Teachers based on principles introduced by theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science in1989: “ 1. Teaching should be consistent with the nature of scientiﬁc inquiry, 2. Teaching should reﬂect scientiﬁc values, 3. Teaching should aim to counteract learning anxieties, 4. Science teaching should extend beyond the school, and 5. Teaching should take its time” (1, 2, 42). This pedagogicalconcept “presupposes that teachers do not emphasize lecture,but rather stress a problem-solving and active exploration” (25,42) via student-led interactive conversations, laboratory appli-cation, and awareness of current science principles. The need for such highlighted teaching practices has come to the forefront in recent years, with the National ResearchCouncil’s publication of the Framework for K-12 Science Education in 2011 and the collective publication of the Next Generation Science Standards by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council, the American Associa-tion for the Advancement of Science, and the National ScienceTeachers Association in 2013 (31, 32, 33). The NationalResearch Council (32) suggests that the three dimensions fromtheK-12 Framework (practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas) set up educators using the Next Gen- eration Science Standards for successful reformed and inquiry- based instruction through implementation of the following fourprinciples: Lessons: 1. Have broad importance across multiple sciences or engineering --- following fourprinciples: Lessons: 1. Have broad importance across multiple sciences or engineering disciplines or are a key organizing principle ofa single discipline, 2. Provide key tools for understanding or investigating more complex ideas and solving problems, 3. Relate to the interests and life experiences of students or areconnected to societal or personal concerns that require scien-tiﬁc or technological knowledge, and 4. Are teachable and learnable over multiple grades at increasing levels of depth andsophistication. That is, the idea can be made accessible toyounger students but is broad enough to sustain continuedinvestigation over years. Studies have found that educators implementing reformed teaching principles in the classroom reported high levels ofmeaningful conversation, critical proposition and analysis ofproblems, and improved conﬁdence in their students resultingin documented academic success (29, 46). In the cited exam-ples, those with the most signiﬁcantly reformed instruction, asmeasured by the reformed teaching observation protocol(RTOP), enhanced the characteristics described above andfostered student-centered, inquiry-based discussion and im-proved student-teacher relationships and overall studentgrowth. Lessons producing the least reform were typicallyteacher centered, preventing students from structuring the the-oretical framework to ask questions, participate in meaningfulcommunication, and ultimately relate to the content, therebyremaining unengaged in the learning process.The need for instructional training toward reformed teaching. While some researchers fear that reformed teaching does not necessarily translate into inquiry-based instructiondue to variables such as teacher and student motivation (23,51), the studies above have demonstrated that a strong corre-lation does in fact exist between the two concepts (39, 42, 46).A more recent study by Mattheis and Murray (26) also reportedthat conceptual changes on the part of
program, particular care was taken to ensure thatthese components were integrated into the teacher developmentprocess and that appropriate instrumentation was used to mea-sure their success. Laboratory-based professional development as a means of promoting high standards in science education. Over the past several decades, a number of development programs thatpromote active and student-centered learning on the part ofteachers in the high school sciences have emerged. In the early2000s, Schwartz, Lederman, and Crawford conducted a studyin which educators served as interns in university laboratorysettings. Results indicated that participants gained a philosoph-ical appreciation for the “nature of science” and consequentlyimplemented such philosophies in their own classrooms (55).Similar programs conducted by The University of Tennessee,the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, and the ScienceFor Early Adolescence Teachers organization found that a“viable constructivist model for exposing teachers to scienceresearch and transferring that experience to the classroom” wasaccomplished (8, 29). These “apprenticeship” models in whichthe science educator gets to participate in a laboratory experi-ence, side by side with an expert scientist, allow for “the novicelearner to become an expert through the mechanism of accul-turation into the world of the expert” (8).How We Teach: Generalizable Education Research 342 EVALUATING A LABORATORY-BASED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM Advances in Physiology Education •doi:10.1152/advan.00088.2015 •http://advan.physiology.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/advances (168.176.005.118) on August 20, 2024.
From its earliest beginnings nearly 25 yr ago, the laboratory apprenticeship model of professional development has beenstrongly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF)and has collectively come to be known as the Research Expe-riences for Teachers (RET) program (40, 41). The RET Pro-gram was originally modeled to emulate the NSF ResearchExperiences of Undergraduates Program, with a goal to pro-mote interactions and professional development between sci-ence professionals in the K–12, university, private, and gov-ernment sectors (37, 40, 41). Nearly all RET programs are nowfunded through this centralized agency, and their success hasbeen well documented (12, 27, 54). With these programs inmind, it was possible to construct a foundation for the currentprogram being highlighted in this study, focusing primarily onhow they might be improved on to provide more pedagogicalinstruction for successful translation into the classroom. Research questions. In looking at the two aforementioned aspects of science education, reformed teaching and laborato-ry-based professional development, it was hypothesized that anovel marriage of the two concepts would result in an optimumfacilitation of both pedagogical and practical teacher prepared-ness for effective classroom teaching. Concepts such as activelearning, inquiry, problem solving, investigating complexideas, and providing application can all be easily attained whileworking in the laboratory. However, their translation intovaluable lessons at a level that is consistent with the middle andhigh school classroom can often be challenging. On thatpremise, the purpose of the present study was to examine alaboratory-based professional development program and itsability to facilitate the emergence of reformed teaching prin-ciples in those classrooms. This included the participants’ability to integrate advanced laboratory training, research prin-ciples, and student-led instruction into their daily lessons andto develop novel
research prin-ciples, and student-led instruction into their daily lessons andto develop novel activities for classroom implementation. Thisstudy also sought to reveal any improvements in teacherperformance, job satisfaction, conﬁdence, and self-efﬁcacyresulting from these changes upon return to the classroom. Forthe purposes of this study, self-efﬁcacy was deﬁned as theextent to which teachers believe they can instruct in a mannerthat will generate a desired outcome in their students (6). Assuch, the following research questions were examined: 1. What impact does laboratory-based professional develop- ment, which includes advanced training in laboratory tech-niques, research principles, and reformed, student-centeredmethods, have on the adoption of reformed teaching practicesand student-centered instruction by high school teachers in thescience classroom? 2. To what extent does improved teacher efﬁcacy, conﬁ- dence, and overall job satisfaction result from inquiry-basedand reformed teaching methods when they are taught during alaboratory-based professional development program? MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study used a mixed methods approach, using multiple qualitative and quantitative resources appropriate for their respectivemeasurements. Because of the small sample size, it was found that anyquantitative measurements would require signiﬁcant qualitative rein-forcement to generate an understanding of the overall educationalimpact. Given both the data-driven nature of scientiﬁc research andthe humanistic nature of education as a profession, this approach wasdeemed to be appropriate for the study. After a year-long pilot studyand Institutional Review Board approval in 2012, data were collected over a 1-yr period, from the spring of 2013 through the fall of 2013,as part of a program titled the Science Educator Research Fellowship(SERF). The SERF Program was created by Sanford Research (Sioux Falls, SD) in response to a national initiative meant to identify new
by Sanford Research (Sioux Falls, SD) in response to a national initiative meant to identify new ap-proaches for the improvement of science, technology, engineering,and mathematics (STEM) education and the teaching of 21st centuryskills (50). SERF participants were engaged with pediatric healthresearch opportunities using basic, translational, and community-based approaches as well as professional development and pedagog-ical training over a 10-wk summer session within a pediatric researchdepartment that housed a diverse number of research projects beingconducted by both MD and PdD researchers with medical and basicscience training. This method was focused on enhancing innovativelearning techniques in the classroom and creating novel approaches toapplied and experiential classroom activities while being grounded inthe program experience and reformed student-led activity. This pro-cess was further highlighted by weekly events, round table discus-sions, and research and ethics seminars, all presented by scientist-mentors, as well as pedagogical training focused on reformed teachingand inquiry-based instruction, presentations led by participants, and aculminating symposium. The long-term goal of the SERF program was to provide a mechanism for stimulating student cognition andmotivation by providing participating educators with a deeper under-standing of content, application, discussion, technique, and ethicswhile improving conﬁdence in both teaching abilities and laboratorytechniques. It was felt that the activities described above would notonly foster that stimulation, understanding, and conﬁdence but wouldalso provide unique individual experiences that would ultimatelymotivate participants to instill such changes in both their instructionalapproaches and classroom environment. An outline of the SERFprogram as well as a summary of data collected are shown in Fig. 1. Participants. Data collected for this study came from two male and ﬁve female teachers ( n/H110057, --- as artifacts of positive growth and development of program participants and the SERF program itself. DISCUSSION Over the last quarter century, research reports pertaining to laboratory-based professional development programs have dem-onstrated outcomes that improved teacher performance, providedpractical experience, and promoted high technical science stan-dards (8, 40, 41, 52, 53, 54). While this mode of training has beenvalidated as being successful in the development of laboratoryskillsets, such attempts have mainly focused on the laboratoryexperience without including the instructional and pedagogicalintervention that would ensure translation into the classroom (35,39). Thus, a direct connection between laboratory-based profes-sional development and an improvement in instruction, basedspeciﬁcally on the unique pedagogical intervention and trainingprovided during the SERF program, has not been commonlyobserved in previous investigations. The present study illustrated that classroom instruction for SERF participants seemed to directly impact their participationin laboratory-based professional development supported bypedagogical training. This was seen in its successful translationinto inquiry-based lessons in the secondary classroom. On thebasis of the ﬁndings described above, supported by additionalevidence found in lessons developed by program participants,a number of observations can be noted regarding the state ofteacher progress in this study of reformed practices and inqui-ry-based instruction, teacher efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, and overalljob satisfaction as it pertains to their participation in the SERFprogram. Although there was evidence of a desire to resistchanges in lesson planning and design, indication of positivegrowth toward such practices could be documented on anumber of fronts. This included growth in the beliefs of SERFparticipants as well as hard evidence of student engagement,student-teacher relationships, curriculum and content selection,and --- evidence of student engagement,student-teacher relationships, curriculum and content selection,and improvements in classroom culture as prescribed by theoutcomes of the RTOP evaluation. Second, it was evident thatthe SERF program had a profound positive impact on teaching efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, and job satisfaction among program par-ticipants. One could speculate that these two general ﬁndings are correlated, based on subject response and observer notes re- corded during data collection. Participants were found to haveenhanced student participation and classroom leadership byplacing the onus for educational advancement on the studentrather than the teacher, in addition to improved their overallclassroom culture by developing quality STEM curriculum,guided inquiry, and technology-driven activities upon comple-tion of the SERF program. Although teachers were found tohave some level of difﬁculty transitioning to wholly student-led instruction due to both student inﬂuence and a desire tomaintain common practice, this study did determine an in-creased belief in, and progression toward, such teaching prac-tices both in terms of delivery and student performance. How-ever, this study did not speciﬁcally determine which aspects ofthe SERF program had led to these pedagogical outcomes.Moreover, because of the small number of participants, andtherefore limited sample demographics, it would be unwise toextrapolate these ﬁndings to the general population of middleand high school science teachers without further study and alarger sample. Previous studies have indicated that the absence of novel student innovation and guided inquiry and instead the pres-ence of predetermined “cookie cutter” activity in the class-room have a negative impact on teacher attitude and per-formance (18, 47). This effect contributed to a lack ofteacher conﬁdence and efﬁcacy that ultimately led to higherattrition rates (17). These characteristics were found to beparticularly evident in rural Midwestern
Participants. Data collected for this study came from two male and ﬁve female teachers ( n/H110057, age: 25–47 yr) and indirectly through /H11011300 students. All participants were selected by a committee of independent scientists not speciﬁcally involved in the blind handlingof data for this research study and were placed in complementarylaboratory settings based on an examination of individual interests,experience, and laboratory availability. The criteria used for selectionincluded previous performance in the classroom as well as demon-strated need and scale of potential impacts. To begin this process, ane-mail and application were sent to all science educators in the stateof South Dakota, inviting them to apply to be part of the 10-wkprogram, and participants were selected from this pool. Analysis ofdemographic data revealed some common factors. All participantstaught in public schools within the state of South Dakota, representingan even distribution of rural ( n/H110053) and urban ( n/H110054) designations, with district populations ranging from just a few hundred to over onethousand students. These individuals displayed signiﬁcant diversity interms of professional/educational training and years of experience,including participants new to the ﬁeld of education, those in themiddle portion of their careers, and those nearing closer to the end oftheir careers. Participating educators taught multiple high school andmiddle school science courses, including Physical Science, Life Sci-ence, Biology, Advanced Biology, Anatomy and Physiology, Zool-ogy, Chemistry, Advanced Placement Chemistry, and Physical Edu-cation. Although the participants were not selected randomly, it wasfelt that the demographic described above was representative of theteaching population in the state of South Dakota and therefore couldbe considered more or less representative of that population.

compiled by independent evaluators, contracted by Sanford Research, and then assessed blindly by the authors of the present study. Thesedata encompassed both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Whilecare should be taken not to generalize too liberally from a smallsample size, it is nonetheless pertinent to the evaluation of the effectof this program on the participants described in this study. As such, alldata collection was assumed to be in the context of a case study inwhich these experimental data established correlational signiﬁcanceas it pertained to program participants. One data set was made up ofpre- and posttreatment scores based on the well-established RTOP. Asecond data set was collected through pre- and postprogram RETsurveys originally developed by SRI for use with the National ScienceFoundation RET program (34, 40, 41, 45). A supplementary sectionwas included with this survey to collect additional qualitative datafrom the participants. Finally, a third data set was composed oftranscripts and responsive ﬂow charts collected during pre- andpostprogram focus groups conducted exclusively for use in this study.For reference, a copy of each of these three instruments has beenprovided as supplementary information. 1 RTOP. The RTOP was developed by the Evaluation Facilitation Group of the Arizona Collaborative for Excellence in the Preparationof Teachers for the purpose of measuring innovative, student-cen-tered, constructivist teaching in the science classroom (36). The goalis for the RTOP to evaluate and promote the concepts of problemsolving, reasoning with proof, communication, connections, and rep-resentation, ultimately raising the standards and expectations in thescience and mathematics classroom (30). The instrument itself is a25-item assessment divided into 3 subsets: 5 items used to gaugelesson design and implementation, 10 items evaluating the content,and 10 items assessing the classroom culture. With regard to the ﬁrstsubset of questions, the
10 items assessing the classroom culture. With regard to the ﬁrstsubset of questions, the intent is to determine how well a lesson“recognizes a student’s prior knowledge and preconceptions, engageseach student as a member of the learning community, values variety in the possible solutions to problems being addressed, and allows forstudent-led discussion and direction” (36). The second subset can befurther divided into content quality and the ability of that content todevelop inquiry among classroom participants. The third and ﬁnalsubset focuses on the stimulation and climate of the classroomenvironment itself and is also broken down into two sections: com-municative interactions and student-teacher relationships (42). Interms of validity and reliability, the RTOP has been evaluated in anumber of classroom settings, including mathematics, physics, chem-istry, and biology. Assessments from three independent evaluatorstrained in proper RTOP assessment were compiled for comparison ofinterrater reliability and normalized using percent agreement as astandard. The results were estimated at an exceptionally high level forinstruments of this nature (36). Coursework and training using RTOP assessment as an instrument for measuring reformed teaching have served as a platform to facili-tate pedagogical change in numerous applications (11, 42). Forexample, observer notes from an RTOP study in 2001 noted numerous characteristics as a result of professional development, including thecatalysis of student-centered teaching and conversation in the class-room, self-reﬂective change, and improved collegial behavior (24).Explicit communication of such goals during professional trainingfosters success in the classroom by helping educators to understandand operationally deﬁne reformed teaching (24). Individuals success-fully trained in RTOP assessment have cited its use as credible,authentic, justiﬁable, and believable (24). Furthermore, its use hasbeen shown to both empower educators to

Furthermore, its use hasbeen shown to both empower educators to self-reﬂect on their practiceusing the rubric to critique their own performance as well as continueto reconceptualize those approaches while sustaining or even catalyz-ing similar practices among their colleagues through improved rela-tionships and communication (20, 24). Pre- and postprogram RET surveys. A 26-item survey, developed by SRI for review of the NSF’s RET programs, was selected andamended to include a second section for questioning of SERFparticipants on their background, experience, and beliefs regarding 1Supplemental Material for this article is available at the Advances in Physiology Education website.

Because of many distinct similaritiesbetween the NSF’s RET program and SERF program as well as thesurvey’s established validity and reliability, it was determined thatthe questionnaire would suit this study when attempting to deter-mine 1) the importance of professional development in the peda- gogical development of the subjects, 2) how the conﬁdence and personal beliefs of these educators will change while participatingin the SERF program, and 3) how school demographics, funding, and outside training will inﬂuence the teaching practices of pro-gram participants. Responses to the RET survey were subcatego-rized according to their relevance in answering either research question 1 or2and according to their support of either reformed or traditional pedagogical tendencies. A secondary survey created bySRI for the NSF RET program, known as a program evaluationsurvey, was also administered for program assessment but was notused as data for this study. Focus groups. To gain a qualitative understanding of how par- ticipating teachers perceived their ability to conﬁdently and efﬁ-caciously communicate scientiﬁc knowledge to their students, aseries of two focus groups was constructed for implementation atthe beginning and end of the program. Questions were designed toallow for open-ended responses and were used as a general ﬂowchart for discussion. To provide a frame of reference for theirresponses, each participant was provided with a response sheetcontaining 5- and 10-point Likert scales that accompanied appro-priate questions during each session. Items from the focus groupprotocol were intended to gauge how participants typically usetheir time during classroom lessons, how they perceive the satis-faction and challenges of their day-to-day jobs, the ingenuity beingused during and frequency of classroom laboratory experiences,and how they perceive their ability to educate students.
of classroom laboratory experiences,and how they perceive their ability to educate students. Theseresponses were subcategorized according to their relevance inanswering either research question 1 or2. In each case, their opinions about how the SERF program played a role in theirsuccesses and failures were also evaluated. Focus group sessionswere video recorded, transcribed, and administered by trainedemployees of Sanford Research not afﬁliated with this study. Analysis. Data were organized according to a paired and coded system, allowing for evaluation of each participant across multipledata sets, before and after treatment. Interrater reliability of allevaluative techniques was determined through a percentage ofagreement correlation before further analysis (96% agreement).Because of the small sample size and nonrandom selection ofparticipants, all data were assessed on the premise that any and alloutcomes could not be generalized but instead provided an intimatepicture that illustrated the impact and effectiveness of the SERFprogram on its participants.Categorization of data subsets for analysis of research questions 1 and2is shown in Fig. 2. In each paired-samples t-test, signiﬁcance required an /H9251-level of P/H110210.05. All numeric data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences and Microsoft Excel,whereas all transcribed data were coded and evaluated by researchersinvolved in the study. Research question 1 asks about the impact of pedagogical and/or specialized skills training (acquired during a laboratory-based profes-sional development program) on the participants’ willingness to adoptreformed teaching practices in the secondary science classroom. Threemeasures were used to analyze the correlating data. First, a one-tailedpaired-samples t-test was used to determine if there was any growth in student-centered, inquiry-based instruction as determined by RTOPanalysis, both on individual subset scores and overall scores. Similarone-tailed --- education. As a result, participants feltthat their overall conﬁdence and job satisfaction had im-proved, and each indicated that they planned to continuetheir career as a science educator for the foreseeable future,although several have been offered and are pursuing sec-ondary jobs in laboratory research. A sample of their re-sponses is shown in Fig. 5. In a ﬁnal analysis, qualitative responses to the postprogram RET survey indicated that many of the SERF participants feltthat they had improved teaching efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, and jobsatisfaction as a direct result of their experience in the program.Likert scale responses pertaining to questions about beliefs inpractice and knowledge of content resulted in mean valuationsof 2.92, 3.43, and 3.14 on a four-point scale for improvedteaching efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, and job satisfaction, respec-tively. Individual statements in response to such questions areshown in Fig. 6. Lessons as artifacts of participant growth and development. As a pedagogical training exercise, SERF participants wereexpected to develop lessons inspired by their experience in theprogram. Each teacher was matched with a research mentorperforming biomedical research on pediatric health projectsspanning molecular and physiological processes across a vari-ety of cells and tissues.

determined by RTOPanalysis, both on individual subset scores and overall scores. Similarone-tailed paired-samples t-tests were implemented on subset scores of Likert scale responses from the RET survey and were used to assessfor speciﬁc examples of growth in speciﬁc pedagogical techniques,observations, and experiences that lend themselves to student learn-ing. In each case, effect size was determined using Cohen’s das a measure of practical (educational) signiﬁcance (9). Short-answer re-sponses from both the RET survey and focus groups were codedaccording to similar pedagogical categories for the purpose of citingspeciﬁc in-class examples. Research question 2 addresses the extent to which the treatment improved teacher efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, and overall job satisfaction.One-tailed paired-samples t-tests were used on subset scores of Likert scale responses to the RET survey and focus group to assess positivegrowth in the aforementioned areas. In each case, effect size wasdetermined using Cohen’s das a measure of practical (educational) signiﬁcance (9). Notes taken by RTOP observers were analyzed forcited evidence in the classroom. Teacher efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, andoverall job satisfaction were used as a categorical guide to code allwritten responses from each instrument to determine if individualbeliefs, backgrounds, and attitudes about teaching display similargrowth after treatment. Reformed lesson plan development. As part of the SERF program, participants were expected to generate individual classroom activitiesgrounded in reformed teaching and inquiry-based instruction. Further-more, these activities were expected to pull from inspiration generatedduring their laboratory-based research experience. As a result, activ-ities were inherently physiological and pediatric health oriented innature. Although not included in the data analysis, these lessonsserved as artifacts of participant growth and development as well asprogram success. Institutional review board approval.
RESULTS General outcomes for evidence of reformed teaching. The ﬁrst research question examined what impact(s) laboratory-based professional development, which includes advancedtraining in laboratory technique, research principles, and inno-vative lesson plan development, had on the likelihood ofreformed teaching practices and inquiry-based learning beingadopted by the participants in their science classrooms. To thatend, the overall and subgroup RTOP scores, RET surveysubgroup scores, and mean focus group Likert scale scores ofall seven participants were analyzed. The results of eachquantitative analysis pertaining to the ﬁrst research questionare shown in Table 1. With respect to the RTOP analysis,content ( t/H110052.22, d/H110050.837, P/H110050.034), classroom culture (t/H110053.35, d/H110051.266, P/H110050.033), and overall ( t/H110052.34, d/H11005 0.847, P/H110050.033) reformed classroom instruction showed signiﬁcant improvement. This suggests that SERF participantshave modiﬁed their curriculum to provide a more effectiveapproach that allows for students to drive the instruction ratherthan the other way around. However, the results of the lessondesign and implementation analysis ( t/H110050.78, d/H110050.293, P/H11005 0.234) suggest that while overall instruction indicated progres-sion toward the desired instructional techniques, actual lessondesign did not change signiﬁcantly. This is likely the result ofteachers being “creatures of habit,” and although delivery andapproaches were strongly inﬂuenced, participants chose not toredevelop lesson plans that had proven worthy in previousyears of instruction. Observer notes from the RTOP evaluations supported the notion of improvement in the desired teaching practices uponcompletion of the program. While results varied among indi-vidual subjects, the overall results were positive toward notice-able change in student relationships and engagement in thelesson. Speciﬁcally, observer notes indicated a high level
relationships and engagement in thelesson. Speciﬁcally, observer notes indicated a high level ofrespect and interaction in and among students and instructors,noticeable (although variable) improvement between springand fall observations, strong topics of discussion and curricu-lum content, and at least some level of reﬂection by thestudents in most cases. It was noted by all observers that thelevel of conﬁdence among SERF participants appeared toimprove signiﬁcantly upon completion of the program. Spe-ciﬁc responses included the following: •“While individual performances varied, there was a deﬁnite improvement in reformed teaching over the course of thestudy.” ( Observer 1 )•“Some teachers appeared reluctant to change their approach to lesson plans and implementation.” ( Observer 2 ) •“The content and interaction in many of the classes appeared to be functioning at a much higher level for some teachers inthe fall observations.” ( Observer 3 ) A second portion of the analysis using the RET survey results and two paired-samples t-tests followed by a measure of Cohen’s dfor effect size measured changes in classroom practices favoring reformed teaching principles or traditionalapproaches. In this case, signiﬁcant changes were not reportedfor either reformed ( t/H110051.72, d/H110050.651, P/H110050.068) or traditional ( t/H110050.35, d/H110050.134, P/H110050.368) tendencies. However, based on the medium to large effect size of thereformed measurement and near signiﬁcance, it could be sug-gested that early signs of posttreatment enhancement of in-structional techniques were present. While the statistical results of the RET survey indicated minimal evidence of improved use of reformed teaching prac-tice, promise of a belief toward that transition could be foundin the qualitative responses to part I ,items 12a–d , which asked participants to describe their recent professional developmentactivities in the context of innovative and technologicallydriven pedagogy. When asked
developmentactivities in the context of innovative and technologicallydriven pedagogy. When asked about participation in profes-sional development experiences since the SERF program, eachof the seven program participants indicated active involvementin curriculum and methodology programming geared at im-proving student questioning, invention, and engagement inSTEM areas. Thus, one could imply that these individualsshare a strong desire to improve their ability to involve studentsin approaches consistent with constructivist beliefs regardingstudent participation and direction. A quantitative analysis of focus group responses indicated no statistical signiﬁcance toward improved reformed instruc-tion ( t/H11005/H11002 0.20, d/H11005/H11002 0.077, P/H110050.577). However, qualita- tive responses to focus group questions also indicated a strongdichotomy between the desire to implement and actual imple-mentation of those teaching practices in the classroom. Whilemany of the subjects indicated an increased ability as teachersto integrate current, applied, and relevant topics into their dailyinstruction and a desire to move forward with applied activi-ties, they felt that the reluctance to fully adopt student-drivenactivities fell with their students’ inexperience in being able tosuccessfully complete assignments in which they were asked tocreate driving questions and guide the direction of the lesson.Speciﬁc responses to this topic are shown in Fig. 3.Table 1.

General outcomes for evidence of teaching efﬁcacy, conﬁ- dence, and job satisfaction. Research question 2 sought to determine what measurable effect participation in the SERFprogram had on improving teacher efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, andoverall job satisfaction. To answer that question, three separateanalyses were completed. The results of each of those analysesare shown in Table 2 for both the RET survey ( t/H110054.34, d/H11005 1.642, P/H110050.002) and focus group responses ( t/H110055.28, d/H11005 1.997, P/H110050.001) and suggest a profound impact on overall pedagogical performance. This supports the notion that teach-ers who are provided the opportunity to develop skills learnedduring professional development are much more likely toimplement those processes in the classroom. Qualitative responses to the RET survey ( part I ,items 8 and 9), which asked the participants to identify their strengths and weaknesses as a teacher, demonstrated a high level of conﬁ-dence in each participant’s ability to incorporate real-world andlaboratory-based application into their curriculum, to commu-nicate with students in a manner that is backed up by actualscientiﬁc experience, and to develop student-teacher relation-ships with those students based on their passion and enthusi-asm for their content area. Each participant also indicated astrong desire to improve on the implementation of laboratoryexperiments, problem solving, and guided inquiry in his or herclassroom. Speciﬁc responses to this line of questioning areshown in Fig. 4. Qualitative responses to the focus group indicated a vast improvement in overall teaching efﬁcacy, conﬁdence, andjob satisfaction as a result of participating in the SERF program. Comments indicated a positive outlook on eachparticipant’s ability to inspire their students to becomecurious and effective observers of the world as it pertains tosuccessful science education. As a result, participants feltthat their overall conﬁdence and job satisfaction had
based on an examination of individual interests, experience, and laboratory availability within a pediatric research depart-ment that housed a diverse number of research projects beingconducted by both MD and PdD researchers with medical andbasic science training. Examples of projects included the fol-lowing: 1) mapping protein interactions in laminopathy-related gene mutants by expressing proximity-based promiscuous bi-otin ligase fusion proteins in immortalized human cells, 2) maternal programming of fetal cardiogenesis in rats through ahigh-fat diet and gestational diabetes, 3) characterizing motile ciliary defects during organogenesis in a novel mouse mutantof primary ciliary dyskinesia, 4) hyperoxic disruption of mito- chondrial redox homeostasis in cultured alveolar epithelialcells, 5) movement performance to predict injury susceptibility in healthy athletes, and 6) maternal drinking behaviors pre- and postconception. Multiple lessons were generated by teachers asa result of their experiences that allowed for translation of thesecomplex topics into relevant and applied physiology topics forclassroom instruction, including proteomic comparisons ofbiological samples by SDS-PAGE, evaluating genetic status byPCR and gel electrophoresis, behavioral observations of organ-isms fed high-fat diets, testing exercise programs for injury riskreduction, and creating service announcements about fetalalcohol spectrum disorders. In each case, projects were pre-sented with the intent of engaging students through reformed,student-led, and inquiry-based instruction. These lessons serve Fig. 4.

These characteristics were found to beparticularly evident in rural Midwestern communities,where teachers are often expected to teach a signiﬁcantcourse load with limited resources and were highlighted asan area in critical need of improvement (38, 48, 49). This study supports that, in the case of these seven program participants, the integration of constructivist practices, specif- Fig. 6.

ically the reformed instructional practices highlighted in this study, into a laboratory-based professional development pro-gram can have a profound positive effect on teacher efﬁcacy,conﬁdence, and overall job satisfaction. It also supported thenotion that such changes can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence onoverall classroom culture, productivity, and student engage-ment. Despite the small number of study participants, theseresults also seem to strongly suggest that professional devel-opment such as that described above can signiﬁcantly enhancethe participants’ pedagogical approaches, self-efﬁcacy, conﬁ-dence, and overall performance.

El artículo "Evaluating the effectiveness of a laboratory-based professional development program for science educators" de Michael W. Amolins y colaboradores, publicado en "Advances in Physiology Education", examina la necesidad de mejorar la formación de educadores en ciencias mediante un programa de desarrollo profesional centrado en laboratorios. Este estudio se sitúa en un contexto donde la educación científica enfrenta el reto de preparar a los estudiantes para un mercado laboral en constante cambio, especialmente en campos como la biotecnología y la medicina.

### Contexto y Justificación
La educación en ciencias es una prioridad para la comunidad educativa, con investigaciones que enfatizan la importancia de que los docentes no solo posean un profundo conocimiento de su materia, sino que también participen en un desarrollo profesional fundamentado en principios constructivistas. Estos principios promueven un enfoque centrado en el estudiante y basado en la indagación, crucial para un aprendizaje efectivo. Sin embargo, muchos programas de formación no han logrado integrar adecuadamente la experiencia de laboratorio en el aula, lo que es problemático dado que la práctica en laboratorio es esencial para enseñar conceptos científicos complejos. Además, aunque han surgido programas de capacitación en laboratorio, a menudo carecen de estrategias para traducir las habilidades adquiridas en el laboratorio a prácticas de enseñanza reformadas en el aula.

### Objetivo del Estudio
El objetivo principal del estudio fue evaluar la efectividad de un programa de desarrollo profesional que se centra en la integración de principios de enseñanza reformada en las aulas de ciencias. Este enfoque busca no solo mejorar las habilidades de los educadores en el laboratorio, sino también asegurar que estas habilidades se reflejen en su práctica docente diaria.

### Metodología
El estudio se llevó a cabo en la Universidad de Dakota del Sur, involucrando a educadores de ciencias en un programa que incluía formación práctica en laboratorio y estrategias pedagógicas innovadoras. Se evaluó cómo los participantes aplicaron lo aprendido en sus aulas y se midió el impacto en el aprendizaje de los estudiantes.

### Resultados y Conclusiones
Los resultados sugieren que un enfoque de desarrollo profesional que combine la formación en laboratorio con la pedagogía reformada puede ser efectivo para mejorar la enseñanza de las ciencias. Los educadores que participaron mostraron mayor confianza y competencia en la implementación de métodos de enseñanza centrados en el estudiante, beneficiando así el aprendizaje de sus alumnos. El estudio destaca la importancia de integrar experiencias de laboratorio en la formación de educadores de ciencias y sugiere que este tipo de desarrollo profesional puede ser un camino viable para mejorar la calidad de la educación científica, especialmente en un contexto donde la demanda de profesionales capacitados en ciencias es creciente.

### Enfoque del Programa
El programa se basa en la implementación de estrategias de enseñanza que utilizan principios constructivistas, promoviendo el aprendizaje basado en la indagación. Este enfoque ha demostrado mejorar tanto la eficacia como el rendimiento estudiantil. La enseñanza reformada se alinea con la indagación científica, abordando la ansiedad de aprendizaje y optimizando la experiencia educativa, conectando más allá del contenido del libro de texto.

### Capacitación y Resistencia
Se ha documentado que existen diferencias significativas en los resultados de éxito estudiantil entre el aprendizaje activo y la enseñanza tradicional, favoreciendo el enfoque reformado. Sin embargo, se observó resistencia a modificar los protocolos establecidos en el aula, lo que sugiere que, a pesar de la formación, algunos educadores tienden a utilizar técnicas con las que están familiarizados.

### Reflexión y Colaboración
El texto también enfatiza la importancia de la reflexión docente y la colaboración entre colegas para fomentar un ambiente de aprendizaje constructivista. Se discuten las percepciones de los estudiantes sobre el aprendizaje constructivista y cómo estas pueden variar según el año del programa y el entorno de aprendizaje.

### Implicaciones para la Formación Continua
El estudio concluye que la enseñanza de la ciencia aplicada requiere no solo un conocimiento profundo del contenido, sino también la capacidad de facilitar diálogos liderados por los estudiantes sobre observación, investigación y descubrimiento. La implementación de técnicas de indagación es fundamental para el éxito educativo, transformando el entorno de aprendizaje en las aulas de ciencias.

### Evaluación del Programa SERF
El programa SERF (Summer Educator Research Fellowship) se desarrolló como parte de una iniciativa nacional para mejorar la educación en STEM. Se llevó a cabo durante un verano de 10 semanas, donde los participantes se involucraron en oportunidades de investigación en salud pediátrica. El objetivo a largo plazo era estimular la cognición y motivación de los estudiantes, proporcionando a los educadores una comprensión más profunda del contenido y mejorando su confianza en sus habilidades de enseñanza.

### Resultados del Programa
Los resultados del programa SERF mostraron un impacto positivo en la eficacia docente, la confianza y la satisfacción laboral de los participantes. A pesar de las limitaciones del tamaño de la muestra, los hallazgos sugieren que la formación profesional en laboratorios puede mejorar significativamente las prácticas pedagógicas y la autoeficacia de los educadores.

### Conclusiones Finales
El estudio resalta la efectividad de los programas de desarrollo profesional basados en laboratorios para elevar los estándares de la educación en ciencias, destacando la importancia de la experiencia práctica y la interacción con expertos en el campo. Se concluye que la combinación de formación en laboratorio y pedagogía reformada puede resultar en una preparación óptima de los docentes para una enseñanza efectiva en el aula.
