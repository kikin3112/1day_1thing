From Weberian Bureaucracy   to Networking Bureaucracy Vadim Kvachev Candidate of Sociological Sciences, Senior Lecturer, Plekhanov Russian University of Economics Address: Stremyanny lane, 36, Moscow, Russian Federation 117997 E-mail: kvachevvg@mail.ru Max Weber viewed organizational bureaucracy as one of the inevitable premises for genesis  of capitalism, and his concept of bureaucracy has been the authoritative instrument in the  analysis of organizations for many years. The Fordist Modern social organization cannot be  imagined without bureaucratic organization. Up to recent times, bureaucratic organization,  existing as a general pattern of organizing social life, seemed to prove to be the ultimate ef - ficiency as a means of organizing governmental bodies as well as big corporations. Today,  Weberian bureaucracy as theory and practice come under criticism as rigid, obsolete, and in - effective. Under the conditions of late capitalism, modern organization is claimed to be more  flexible and more adaptive to changes. It is my belief that the phenomenon of bureaucracy  cannot be analyzed in isolation from other theories of social order. With its strict rules and  regulations, Weberian bureaucracy is the embodiment of Foucauldian disciplinary power at  the organizational level. Foucault’s diagrams expressing power through systematic relations  between humans, objects, and spaces could be the perfect study of bureaucracy. Bureaucracy  changes with the transition from disciplinary power relations to postmodern power rela - tions. The traditional disciplinary instruments (rules, codes, and regulations) give space for  more flexible and even (at first sight) democratic inter-organizational relations. However,  this supposed freed without freedom has its priceк. Deregulation paradoxically leads to even  more regulation, which now appears as self-control and self-surveillance.

Being microscopic  (mostly due to novel technological opportunities) and de-regulative at the same time, this  new networking bureaucracy restructures power relations in organizations in a way that pro - duces behavior leading to atomization and individualization without a freedom. Keywords:  Max Weber, Michel Foucault, bureaucracy, networks, neoliberalism Social sciences owe Max Weber so much that we could truly consider him as one of the  founding fathers of sociology. The notions of Modernity, rationality, social action, and  social stratification were first introduced or at least significantly developed by Weber. Max Weber’s concept of bureaucracy has been the authoritative instrument in the  analysis of organizations for many years. Organizational bureaucracy was viewed by Max  Weber as one of the inevitable premises for the genesis of capitalism. For Weber, the tran - sition from the traditional to the Modern capitalist modes of governing is connected with  a set of specific rules providing for the rationalization and systematization of institutions  and social activities. The origins of these rules lay in Protestant ethics, and resulted in the  disenchantment of the social space. © Vadim Kvachev, 2019 © Centre for Fundamental Sociology, 2019  doi: 10.17323/1728-192x-2019-2-28-40 28 RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019.

RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 29 Due to rationalization, society is no longer imagined as being established as the do - main of eternal laws. Individuals who imagined themselves as being rational restructured  the social space once driven by tradition hierarchies to intentionally-ordered structures  known as bureaucracies. Weberian bureaucratic organization (Weber 1978: 956–958) implies strict jurisdic - tional areas attached to the worker’s position, identifying their functions and ability to  act. It is constructed as a hierarchy of organizational positions from top to bottom levels,  and it requires special training and focused specialization from the members of the or - ganization. It consists of professionals whose lifelong vocation is bureaucratic work and  thus, their working full-time. It is based on written documents, and it is regulated by  general, objectified rules which do not depend on personal will. The Fordist Modern social organization cannot be imagined without bureaucratic or - ganization. The word “bureaucracy” obtained a negative connotation, although in fact  the above-mentioned mode of organizational governing is rather typical than abnormal  in the modern world. Up to recent times, the bureaucratic organization seemed to prove  its ultimate efficiency as a means of organizing governmental bodies as well as big corpo - rations; it existed as a general pattern of organizing social life. Today, the Weberian bureaucracy as theory and practice come under criticism as rig - id, obsolete, and ineffective. Modern organization under the conditions of late capitalism  is claimed to be more flexible and adaptive to changes. The question is could the Webe - rian bureaucracy still be the key pillar in structuring organizations in the fast-changing,  highly-competitive global world? To see how Weberian bureaucracy has changed in the modern world, we should con - sider the evolution of its elements. It is very important to look at how
world, we should con - sider the evolution of its elements. It is very important to look at how Post-modernity has  influenced classic organizational structures. It is my belief that the phenomenon of bureaucracy cannot be analyzed in isolation  from other theories of social order. Weberian bureaucracy with its strict rules and regula - tions is the embodiment of Foucauldian disciplinary power at the organizational level.  Foucault’s diagrams (Deleuze, 2006), expressing power through systematic relations be - tween humans, objects, and spaces, could be an example of the perfect study of orga - nizational systems. Is there a more colorful representation of classic Weberian bureau - cracy than the diagram of the office space with strict rules, a dress-code, and a chain of  command incarnating certain power relations aimed to discipline and organize obedient  workers in an “objective” structured hierarchy? Moreover, there is also interesting paral - lel between Foucault’s theory of power/knowledge and Weber’s recognition of the role  of information in the bureaucratic administration (Swedeberg, Agevall, 2005). I want  to use the lenses of Foucauldian analysis to demonstrate the relevance of the Weberian  bureaucratic concept in a Modern organizational structure analysis and its modification  in the Post-modern era. While defining bureaucracy, Weber writes that the idea of jurisdictional areas is es - sential for this notion. The bureaucracy is based on the rules, laws, or administrative reg - ulations defining particular activities: “The regular activities required for the purpose of
30 RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 the bureaucratically governed structure are assigned as official duties” (Weber, 1978: 956).  In other words, the regular work done by the organization is recognized, systematized,  and legalized. The jurisdictional area is exactly the legal provision of the actual work to  be done by the organization. This requires the task of creating a system of knowledge  that connects a particular set of work with its legal recognitions. We can assume power- knowledge relations where knowledge produces power, and power constitutes knowledge  (Foucault, 1975: 27–28). According to Foucault, this process of the creation of power and  knowledge structures is parallel, that is, the object becomes a subject of a power relation  at the same time as systematic knowledge is collected. The system of knowledge becomes  the discursive provision for the system of action intended by power. Weber himself spots  this correlation between power and knowledge in establishing a bureaucratic structure:  “Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge.  This is the feature of it that makes it specifically rational. This consists on the one hand in  technical knowledge which, by itself is sufficient to ensure it a position of extraordinary  power. But, in addition to this, bureaucratic organizations, or the holders of power who  make use of them, have the tendency to increase their power still further by the knowl - edge growing out of experience in the service” (Weber, 1925). Thus, Weber’s concept of  bureaucratic knowledge obtained through rational thinking and experience is very simi - lar to the Foucauldian idea of power-knowledge. Knowledge constitutes rules, and rules  determine authority, becoming its source and sine qua non at the same time. The system of rules and regulation provides a system of the distribution of authority  from top-level management to every element of the organization; integer authority is
of authority  from top-level management to every element of the organization; integer authority is  granulated into small pieces, each of which is attributed to every official. The jurisdic - tional areas delimitate these pieces of authority delegated from the entire authority of the  organization as a whole: “The authority to give the commands required for the discharge  of these duties is distributed in a stable way and is strictly delimited by rules concerning  the coercive means, physical, sacerdonal or otherwise, which may be displaced at the  disposal of officials. Methodical provision is made for the regular and continuous fulfil - ment of these duties and for the exercise of the corresponding rights, only persons who  qualify under general rules are employed” (Weber, 1978: 956). The position of the official  in the bureaucracy is defined through rules and rational knowledge. Rational knowledge  gained by professionals determines rules, rules determine duties, and duties determine  activities and the work of the official. The system of empowerment in the bureaucracy  exists through obtaining and imposing certain rational knowledge about what to do and  how to do it. This is exactly what Weber called the “iron cage. ” The Weberian bureaucratic organization is a representation of rational Modern in - dustrial production in non-material sectors such as management, service, and informa - tion production. In this context, we should bear in mind that Weber conducted a detailed  analysis of the genesis of capitalism. His analysis of bureaucracy is the extension of his  research agenda devoted to exploring rationality in Modern society. The triumph of rationality in industrial production was embodied in the Fordist fac - tory with its detailed division of labor, task-specific workplaces, and the explicit system
RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 31 of worker-efficiency regulation. Weberian bureaucracy was an incarnation of the same  principles long before the exquisite Fordist factory saw the light of day. The principles of  the constant rationalization of activities tested in the laboratory conditions of 19th cen - tury European continental bureaucracy were later implemented in highly-competitive  American business. However, it is exactly the rationalized knowledge that was the grounding for both.  In this case, Foucault uses the term of “analytical space” (1975: 143), the space of system - atized knowledge distributed among individuals in the organization according to their  place, status, functions, and other categories. The analytical space overlaps the system - atized knowledge of individuals and objects in the organizational space, thus determin - ing their status. It may be no accident that the typical representation of the repository  of this type of knowledge is the file-cabinet (French bureau ), as the bureaucracy starts  with this systematized information. Furthermore, Weber put it this way: “The manage - ment of modern office is based upon written documents (the ‘files’) .  . . and upon a staff   and subaltern officials and scribes of all sorts. The body of officials working in an agency  along with respective apparatus of material implements and the files makes up a bureau”  (Weber, 1978: 957) The bureaucratic analytical space is organized through the codification and descrip - tion of knowledge in certain forms. This produces a huge amount of instructions, written  orders, and other types of documents which are systematized in this bureau . Weber also  outlines the need to create a specific class of officials providing the work of organization  with the sustaining of this analytical space in order. In Foucauldian terms, they keep  the analytical space, and are authorized to verify its reality with the knowledge from the  analytical space (truth)
and are authorized to verify its reality with the knowledge from the  analytical space (truth) producing knowledge/power. A bureaucracy divides its supreme  authority into particles and uses the written documents verified according to analytical  space by the authorized class of workers to redistribute it among its officials, attributing  predefined jurisdictional areas to each of them. This distribution is settled as a system of  general rules that is obligatory for every member of the bureaucratic organization: “The  management of the office follows general rules, which are more or less stable, more or  less exhaustive, and which can be learned. Knowledge of these rules represents a special  technical expertise which the officials possess” (Weber, 1978: 958). A bureaucracy is constituted from the analytical space provided by power/knowledge,  resulting in general rules and jurisdictional areas of each individual in the organization,  and manifests itself in creating a social superstructure called a hierarchy, that is, the sys - tematization of these officials in a certain order: “The principles of office hierarchy and of  channels of appeal stipulate a clearly established system of super- and sub-ordination in  which there is a supervision of the lower offices by the higher ones. Such a system offers  the governed the possibility of appealing in a precisely regulated manner, the decision of  a lower office to the corresponding superior authority” (Weber, 1978: 957). A hierarchy is an embodied analytical space that distributes individuals in social and  organizational spaces. A hierarchy is important because it identifies who can wield in - fluence on the analytical space in order to change it, and thus change regulations and
32 RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 the authority distribution. The highest levels of bureaucratic officials exercise power on  the basis of objectified rules, and could change these rules changing the analytical space  (for example, by issuing orders or regulations). Officials at the middle and lower levels  of hierarchy have to obey these rules, although they can resolve uncertain situations or  situations beyond their jurisdictional area using “channels of appeal” to the highest levels. At the level of the individual official, this results in the creation of detailed profession - al specializations and specified working positions: “When the office is fully developed,  official activity demands the full working capacity of the official, irrespective of the fact  that length of this obligatory working hours in the bureau may be limited” (Weber, 1978:  958). In other words, the specific workplace created in the organizational hierarchy of the  bureaucracy requires training and specialization, and full-time work as a lifelong (or at  least long-term) vocation. As part of a bureaucracy, the specially trained and fully-employed individual alienates  part of his life (the working hours) to the organization in which they work; in the same  way, they alienate part of their personality in the form of their skills and abilities. The bu - reaucrat becomes a werewolf: an official worker of a bureaucracy in daylight and a private  individual at night. This transformation take place in the arena of constantly changing  purposes, focuses, and aims of personal activity. While being an official, the individual  pursues the purposes of the organization in which they are employed; as a private person,  they seek a salary for their work and to pursue their own needs and desires. Inside the bureaucratic organization, the behavior of an individual falls under the  controls of the analytical space. Foucault describes disciplinary control in terms of im - posing
controls of the analytical space. Foucault describes disciplinary control in terms of im - posing time-tables (establishing rhythms, imposing particular occupations, or regulating  the cycles of repetition), the measuring and elaborating of the working activity, and the  correlation of body and gestures resulting in body-object articulation, relations that the  body must have with the object that it manipulates (1975: 149). While the third instru - ment was actively used mostly in Fordist factories with its manual labor, the first two  are the good examples of correlating the analytical space with the practical activity of  bureaucratic workers. The working life of the official is measured and evaluated according to the bureaucratic  norms of working time, while the activities performed during this time are scrupulously  described in special documents referred to their jurisdictional area. In other words, dur - ing any particular day, almost each work-step of a bureaucrat is classified and described  in a set of special documents usually known as job instructions or duty regulations. This is also relevant to job content, because bureaucratic work requires specific skills  obtained through education: “Office management .  .  . usually presupposes thorough  training in a field of specialization. This, too, holds increasingly for the modern executive  and employee of a private enterprise, just as it does for the state of officials” (Weber, 1978:  958). In terms of training, the skills of a bureaucrat are also controlled and measured by  means of the analytical space. To implement their duties, the official should prove to have  certain qualities and skills themselves. The system of the evaluation of an official is also
RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 33 established as part of the analytical space attaching certain qualifications characteristic to  each job position, as well as the instruments to measure them. Thus, the life of the bureaucratic worker is split in two parts, separating their social  and professional life as an official subject, and their private life as a natural person. A bu - reaucracy pretends to rule the first one to be delimitated by working hours and working  duties, while the second is a matter of self-management or household activities aimed  at the reproduction of the individual’s labor potential through the satisfaction of needs.  Let me put this in a way similar to the argument of Giorgio Agamben (1998) about the  constituting of the state apparatus from the rejection of part of human life; the Weberian  bureaucracy separates the individual from its naked life (biological needs and demands)  and rejects the former. In the Weberian bureaucracy, the individual is official and noth - ing more since that is how this objectified inhumane structure works. To be a bureaucrat,  one should do their best to isolate personality to become a part of what Foucault called a  machine, meaning inexorable, rationalized systems of operating reality (1975: 163). To be  an element of the machine, individuals should become an element that may be placed,  moved, or articulated by others; to follow the various chronological series that discipline  must combine to form a composite time of his work; and to be a subject of the precise  system of command (Ibid.: 162–169). All of these qualities described are essential char - acteristics of the Weberian bureaucracy, which is a concrete representation of a social  organizational machine. In the tradition of the Foucauldian method, I should elaborate this theoretical model  by conducting a diagrammatic analysis of bureaucracy. In other words, I should accom - plish the analysis with diagrams, that is, technical and
In other words, I should accom - plish the analysis with diagrams, that is, technical and spatial conditions of the function - ing of bureaucracy. The following description will be as general as possible because it  should cover a general definition of the diagram in private corporations, as well as in  public-sector bodies. The typical diagram of Weberian bureaucracy is of course the office, a space in which  the workplaces of bureaucratic workers are organized with a specific logic, and divided  according to the principle of hierarchy by organizational departments. In the old-fash - ioned bureaucracy, each department has its own separate room while more modern orga - nizations tend to have open spaces. In both cases, the highest levels of the administration  usually have their own offices. The workplace of the bureaucratic worker usually consists  of a table, a chair and a computer, but sometimes with office appliances. The daily respon - sibilities of a bureaucratic worker consist of working with files on the computer and com - municating with colleagues, customers, or suppliers in person and through means of the  telephone and the Internet. For the modern bureaucracy, it is typical to have its workers  be present at the workplace for the entire day, except for officially-restricted work-breaks.  Working duties are planned and described, and work-schedules and tasks are defined  by the line managers. All violations of task deadlines and work routines are treated as  inconsistent with the job. The skills and abilities of bureaucratic workers are evaluated according to a predefined  system of the human-resources management. This special evaluation is imposed to mea -

What is it that makes a bureaucracy a perfect social machine? Based on the arguments  listed above, I could outline two essential premises; the separation of the individual into  two parts, professional and personal, with the rejection of the latter from the workspace,  and the rationalization and structuring of social chaos into a solid organizational order  subjugated to the aim of attaining efficiency and productivity. In the first case, bureaucra - cy generates a specific individual subject, a wholesome professional who has no room for  private affection and thoughts in their mind; in the second case, it develops a wholesome  organization which creates rules and borders to differentiate itself from the external cha - os of the free market unifying professionals in pursuing collective goals. The bureaucracy  thus is rather a specific mode of relation between the organization and the individual in  this context than just a social institution (Maravelias, 2003: 551–552). The theory of bureaucracy has influenced the social and economic theory of organi - zation, and researchers have conducted many studies on the topic: R. K. Merton (1952),  P . M. Blau (1956), E. Jacques (1986), W . A. Niskanen (2007), J. Q. Wilson (1991), P . Evans  and J. E. Rauch (1999), and others. The concept of bureaucracy was found to be relevant  in describing the social structure and consistent pattern of functioning of the organiza - tion. In 1937, in The Nature of the Firm, the famous economist Ronald Coase tried to for - mulate an economic explanation to the question of why firms are organized according to  structural hierarchical principles which are different from free market patterns. Nearly a century after Max Weber’s death, the word “bureaucracy” has, at the same  time, become a synonym for inefficiency, rigidity, the
the word “bureaucracy” has, at the same  time, become a synonym for inefficiency, rigidity, the inability to adapt, and even for in - humanity. Several theoretical and practical attempts have been made to uncrown bureau - cracy and promote different forms of organization. In the public sector, one of the most  notable attempts resulted in the book called Reinventing Government  (Osborne, Gaebler,  1992). The authors, D. Osborne and T. Gaebler, propose to deconstruct the bureaucracy  in the public sector, and reorganizing it according to the principles of the private sector.  According to D. Argyriades (2010), the Osbourne-Gaebler model of decentralization, de - regulation, and the downsizing and outsourcing of the public bureaucracy has strongly  influenced the patterns of managing structural changes in governmental organizations. Private-sector companies began reshaping their organizational structures even earlier.  The concepts of flexible, firm, VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity)  and global network-centric organization and others were focused on possible reforms  of the way organizations are managed. Critics of the Weberian bureaucracy argued that  it is obsolete and belongs to the era of Modernity since we are living in Post-modern  conditions where contracts are short-term, relationships require networking, and struc - tures are flexible. This global and organizational evolution produced a whole variety of  optimistic views representing de-regulative trends, including a shift to more personal  freedom. Indeed, the old-fashioned Weberian bureaucracy with its set of strict rules and re - strictions imposed a professional control over the worker. The analytical space of the
RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 35 workplace controls what should be done by each particular worker, as well as how and  when. The lack of freedom under bureaucratic conditions appears obvious. This is the  reason why Weberian bureaucracy as a concept was opposed by many for decades. The opinion about the bureaucracy as a source of total control without any freedom  nearly represents the Marxist idea of the contradiction between positive and negative  freedom literally. Negative freedom destroys the obstacles and rules which prevent an  individual of doing certain things, while positive freedom is the capacity of the individual  to do certain things. The negative freedom of a supposed de-bureaucratization has its price, which is, para - doxically, positive freedom. Deregulation in corporate and public-sector organizations  means risk-shifting from the government and business to the employee who now be - comes overburdened with the defense of social and labor rights that used to be public ser - vices (for example, this is obvious in the cases of healthcare and labor legislation). To be  disciplined by bureaucratic governing also meant, in a way, to be protected by the same  rules that controlled one’s behavior and, for example, to be able to plan for the future, or  to build a career according to unchanging rules.  Weberian bureaucracy revealed itself when exposed to critical changes in the global  economy, namely the spreading of precarity, flexibility, and uncertainty. To adapt to these  changes, organizations have to be flexible and transform rigid forms into more flexible  forms. As it was stated a century and a half ago by Marx and Engels, “all what is solid  melts into air. ” Bureaucratic structures melt into markets and networks while trying to  adjust to these circumstances (Olsen, 2007). These changes could be understood through the lenses of Foucauldian analysis in  the same manner as I subjected the Weberian bureaucracy to. Foucault did
Foucauldian analysis in  the same manner as I subjected the Weberian bureaucracy to. Foucault did not finish his  work with the concept of disciplinary power. In his later works at the end of 1970s, he pro - posed the new concept of bio-power, or the “care of the self, ” which was further developed  by Gilles Deleuze to become the concept of “control society. ” According to Foucault, the  disciplinary power over actions and behavior a posteriori  during the process of activity  from the 18th century is being replaced by the preventive power over self-control and  self-surveillance. Bio-power is internalized in the norms and representations of the sub - ject, that is, the technologies of the self. The new individual is controlled by themselves  and is not punished with rules and restrictions, but by the risks of being exposed to social  risks of illness, unemployment, poverty, etc. In other words, the regulation is implement - ed in the subject who is now responsible for self-regulation and taking care of themselves. Gille Deleuze elaborated Foucault’s argument in the form of what he called the “control  society” (1992). Unlike the disciplinary society, the society of control aspires to demolish  old barriers and rules. Instead, it provides individuals with the freedom to do whatever  they want. Workers are free from the enclosed workspace, strict rules, uniforms, etc. In - stead, the control society establishes a constant monitoring and tracking of individual  activities. Y ou can do whatever you want, but everything will be monitored and recorded. The process of de-bureaucratization starts with the blurring of the boundary that  separated the professional life of an individual from their personal life. In what is usu -
36 RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 ally called “post-bureaucracy” (Hakan Yuksel, 2016), or network-shaped entrepreneurial  organizations, the individual’s professional and personal lives melt into one perpetual  lifestyle where personal abilities and skills are as important as technical skills, and one has  to mix personal and business contacts to be successful. It is reflected in the widely-used  concept of work-life balance which demonstrates the attempt to re-establish the bound - aries missing between the personal and working lives. The reason for this is the changing nature of labor. Labor becomes immaterial; in  other words, it involves the manipulation of intangible objects, for example, information  (Berardi, 2009). This type of labor does not require complex and expensive means of pro - duction, as most of it can be done by means of electronic devices such as a smartphone or  a laptop. These circumstances change the conditions of the labor process, the alienation  of labor, and management into more flexible ways. Following these trends, modern organizations dismantle the traditional disciplinary  instruments (rules, codes, and regulations), thereby giving room for more flexible and  even (at first sight) democratic inter-organizational relations. Big corporations introduce  flexible working hours, get rid of dress-codes, and detailed corporate rules and formality  in communications. The full working-time that existed in the Weberian bureaucracy as an imminent  characteristic of the workplace was transformed to such an extent that it consumed per - sonal time. To the same degree, one’s personal life is consumed by professional purposes  and career building, subordinating the life of an individual in the pursuit of promotions  and larger salaries. The notion of soft skills (personal psychological characteristics) as a  skill required in the workplace is essential in understanding how the post-bureaucracy  devours private space. This labor
workplace is essential in understanding how the post-bureaucracy  devours private space. This labor “involves the investment of subjectivity” while “[t]he  worker’s personality and subjectivity have to be made susceptible to organization and  command” (Lazzarato, 2012). Flexible working hours spread beyond the standard work - ing time, and force a worker to work overtime, at home or during weekends. The same thing is happening with the typical bureaucratic professional vocation. In - stead of life-long professional individuals who had to adapt to a variety of small tasks and  acquire situational competencies, workers come to be involved in a multitude of flexible  employments, activities, and projects. The umbrella term for such a situation is ‘precari - ous work’ , which reflects the instability and uncertainty in one’s socio-professional status  and employment (Bobkov, Kvachev, 2017). This, of course, implies that training should  become more flexible and task-oriented; the classic scholastic education should be re - placed by lifelong-learning oriented towards exclusively practical aims. The jurisdictional areas in the post-bureaucratic organization became as fuzzy as  working hours and professional status. The new project capitalism (Boltanski, Chiapel - lo, 2017) operates outside the classic division of functions and responsibilities, creating  a mixed space of multi-functional interactions and boundless project teams. The AG - ILE methodology teaches how to reshape organizations in order to increase efficiency  through diffusing the hierarchical order of functions, that is, to do each project with
RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 37 multiple teams, which is faster and results in projects being completed at an improved  level at the same time. In terms of hierarchy, teams are formed to work on each separate project. The post- bureaucracy tends to refuse the classic hierarchy structure of dividing the organization  into departments. Instead, it tries to establish networks which allows for the creation of  teams with members who are in line with the project’s tasks. Detailed techniques of regulating the behavior of the individual no longer exist. In  the workplace, the worker is now relatively more “free” to do whatever they need to do  to attain the desired results. The freedom provided in particular actions is subordinate to  the organizational goal. Additionally, it releases the worker from some out-moded regu - lations such as a dress-code, or from the obligation to sit in front of a computer all day. This all appears as freedom from old bureaucratic restrictions. At the same time, it is  clearly only a negative freedom. The de-regulative lack of positive freedom paradoxically  leads to even more regulations that only now appear as self-control and self-surveillance.  This new networking bureaucracy, being very microscopic (mostly due to novel techno - logical opportunities) and de-regulative at the same time, restructures the power rela - tions in the organization in a way that produces behavior which leads to atomization  and individualization without freedom. This phenomenon needs to be studied using the  Weberian theoretical apparatus. Maravelias argues that the post-bureaucracy “continues  and in certain respects intensifies the process of rationalization of human conduct that  bureaucracy set underway” (2003: 551–552). This rationalization reaches far beyond traditional professional competencies, but  involves personality and individual qualities as well. The influential Harvard Business  Review describes the process of managing network
as well. The influential Harvard Business  Review describes the process of managing network organization in writing that “in a con - nected age we need to instill passion and purpose around a shared mission” (Satell, 2015). Instead of Fordist “docile bodies” (the Foucault formulization) in the networking bu - reaucracy, we have docile mindsets trained to be motivated and indoctrinated with the  corporate culture. The bureaucracy exists not in the formal rules but in the attitudes and  values of workers, manifesting itself as a specific structure of thinking. Instead of the We - berian “iron cage, ” the individual is trapped in the “iron net” which allows the individual  to move freely, but each move entangles the individual more and more. Network organization (or post-bureaucracy) through means of ICT creates systems of  control which are exactly in line with the Deleuzian interpretation of Foucault. The work - er is controlled by CCTV monitoring, a complicated system of PC-surveillance, or digital  access badges designed to monitor the worker’s presence at the work place, etc. Just like  the control society in Deleuze’s theoretical constructs, the post-bureaucracy acquires the  shapes of the control organization. Giving freedoms in the framework of attaining orga - nizational goals imposes massive and scrupulous supervision. These are two major characteristics of the networking bureaucracy. The network, of  course, has been developing since ICT technologies and the Internet provide the op - portunities to develop networking communications and to restructure working activities  through online-platforms and applications. In this case, the networking organization has
38 RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 been characterized as “uberized, ” so-called after Uber, which was one of the first compa - nies to introduce such technologies in the management and communication process. As  a result, this process had been called “uberization. ” It is important for the networking bureaucracy to be organized through the means  of ICT. Some researchers argue that this implies not a de-bureaucratization, but a re- bureaucratization (Hodgson 2004), thus reviving principles of the Weberian bureaucracy  in Post-modern conditions. Moreover, ideal types of bureaucracy and post-bureaucracy  are hard to find in real life; for example, empirical study conducted in 2009 identifying  characteristics of bureaucratic and post-bureaucratic workplaces showed that these fea - tures are usually mixed in one organization, or even in one job (Bolin, 2009). Perhaps the final idea of reforming Weberian bureaucracy into a network is not per - sonal freedom (at least, not positive freedom), but the process of increasing the efficiency  of the bureaucratic means of control in the more flexible and fast-changing world. The  famous philosopher Slavoj Žižek who wrote The Puppet and the Dwarf (2003) puts the  problem this way; let us imagine two different fathers; one is the old-fashioned tradi - tionalist who gives his children direct orders of what to do, while the other is a liberal  postmodern father who, without direct orders, convinces the children that they should  do something for their own sake. The latter, even if it is not authoritarian, is much more  dangerous because he tries to manipulate and assure that what you have to do, you have  to do for your own good . This is what is happening with networking bureaucracy; you  do not have to obey strict rules, but, instead, you just have to be compliant to the condi - tions provided in the workplace. In the old-fashioned Weberian bureaucracy, the rules  said that one should correspond to certain
In the old-fashioned Weberian bureaucracy, the rules  said that one should correspond to certain requirements; the networking bureaucracy  provides one with opportunities and if one does not use them, it will lead to bad conse - quences for that individual only. In other words, the networking bureaucracy controls  conditions instead of actions. The concept of human capital (Becker, 1993) is used to transform the bureaucratic  hierarchy and rules into the framework of conditions. According to this concept, each  individual is a holder of their personal human capital, and have to do their best to use it to  create personal income. The purpose of the organization is to provide conditions for each  individual to develop their own capital and for income-generation. This will immediately  lead to mutual benefits for the individual and the organization. However, the creation of conditions implies that if one does not comply with this  framework, it is the individual’s fault, rather than the mismanagement of the organization  or the state. Responsibility for personal actions and even well-being as a result of personal  income shifts from the employer within labour relations to commercial-like networking  relations, being as flexible and precarious as it is possible under modern legal and eco - nomic conditions. Thus, the networking bureaucracy comprehends new, flexible, and innovative means  of control and regulation through the creation of conditions and frameworks. The sepa - ration from formal Weberian principles did not mean de-bureaucratization, but a new  form of the bureaucratization of networks. The complex study of these new forms is yet

От веберовской бюрократии к сетевой бюрократии Вадим Квачев Доцент базовой кафедры ТПП РФ «Развитие человеческого капитала» Российского экономического  университета им. Г. В. Плеханова Адрес: Стремянный пер., д. 36, г. Москва, Российская Федерация 117997 E-mail: kvachevvg@mail.ru  Теория бюрократии Макса Вебера мыслилась как одна из важнейших предпосылок  для формирования современного капитализма. Вплоть до последних десятилетий  предполагалось, что идеальный веберовский тип бюрократии проник во все сферы жизни  и управления, в корпорации и государственное управления и даже является паттерном,  организующим саму современную социальную жизнь. Сегодня веберовскую бюрократию  как теорию и практику постоянно критикуют за жесткость, архаичность и неэффективность.  Современные организации в условиях позднего капитализма претендуют на то, чтобы  быть более гибкими и адаптирующимися к переменам. В настоящей статье обсуждается  возможность концептуализации нового типа бюрократической организации — сетевой  бюрократии. Автор комбинирует фукинианский и веберовский подход к анализу социальной  организации, в частности, то, что Жиль Делёз называл «диаграммами Фуко», то есть  диспозициями людей, вещей и пространств, выражающими
Делёз называл «диаграммами Фуко», то есть  диспозициями людей, вещей и пространств, выражающими отношения власти. Автор  предлагает картину сетевой бюрократии, уходящей от укорененности в дисциплинарной  власти к децентрализованным практикам эпохи позднего капитализма. Сетевая бюрократия  предлагает гибкие инструменты контроля: гибкие рабочие часы, отсутствие жестких правил,  устранение формализма в коммуникациях и рабочем процессе. Однако эта мнимая свобода  дерегулирования оборачивается новой формой контроля. В отличие от классической  веберовской бюрократии, контроль осуществляется посредством делегирования, создание  системы самоконтроля индивидом своей собственной работы через совокупность мер  скрытого паноптического наблюдения: видеокамеры, отслеживание действий сотрудника  за компьютером, контроль времени пребывания на работе через электронные пропуска и  т.п. Эти новые сетевые формы бюрократического контроля предполагают микроконтроль  за действиями работника с помощью новых технологий и таким образом реструктурируют  устаревшие отношения власти, еще сильнее уменьшая пространство личной свободы и  усиливая атомизацию индивида.

From Weberian Bureaucracy   to Networking Bureaucracy Vadim Kvachev Candidate of Sociological Sciences, Senior Lecturer, Plekhanov Russian University of Economics Address: Stremyanny lane, 36, Moscow, Russian Federation 117997 E-mail: kvachevvg@mail.ru Max Weber viewed organizational bureaucracy as one of the inevitable premises for genesis  of capitalism, and his concept of bureaucracy has been the authoritative instrument in the  analysis of organizations for many years. The Fordist Modern social organization cannot be  imagined without bureaucratic organization. Up to recent times, bureaucratic organization,  existing as a general pattern of organizing social life, seemed to prove to be the ultimate ef - ficiency as a means of organizing governmental bodies as well as big corporations. Today,  Weberian bureaucracy as theory and practice come under criticism as rigid, obsolete, and in - effective. Under the conditions of late capitalism, modern organization is claimed to be more  flexible and more adaptive to changes. It is my belief that the phenomenon of bureaucracy  cannot be analyzed in isolation from other theories of social order. With its strict rules and  regulations, Weberian bureaucracy is the embodiment of Foucauldian disciplinary power at  the organizational level. Foucault’s diagrams expressing power through systematic relations  between humans, objects, and spaces could be the perfect study of bureaucracy. Bureaucracy  changes with the transition from disciplinary power relations to postmodern power rela - tions. The traditional disciplinary instruments (rules, codes, and regulations) give space for  more flexible and even (at first sight) democratic inter-organizational relations. However,  this supposed freed without freedom has its priceк. Deregulation paradoxically leads to even  more regulation, which now appears as self-control and self-surveillance.

Being microscopic  (mostly due to novel technological opportunities) and de-regulative at the same time, this  new networking bureaucracy restructures power relations in organizations in a way that pro - duces behavior leading to atomization and individualization without a freedom. Keywords:  Max Weber, Michel Foucault, bureaucracy, networks, neoliberalism Social sciences owe Max Weber so much that we could truly consider him as one of the  founding fathers of sociology. The notions of Modernity, rationality, social action, and  social stratification were first introduced or at least significantly developed by Weber. Max Weber’s concept of bureaucracy has been the authoritative instrument in the  analysis of organizations for many years. Organizational bureaucracy was viewed by Max  Weber as one of the inevitable premises for the genesis of capitalism. For Weber, the tran - sition from the traditional to the Modern capitalist modes of governing is connected with  a set of specific rules providing for the rationalization and systematization of institutions  and social activities. The origins of these rules lay in Protestant ethics, and resulted in the  disenchantment of the social space. © Vadim Kvachev, 2019 © Centre for Fundamental Sociology, 2019  doi: 10.17323/1728-192x-2019-2-28-40 28 RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019.

RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 29 Due to rationalization, society is no longer imagined as being established as the do - main of eternal laws. Individuals who imagined themselves as being rational restructured  the social space once driven by tradition hierarchies to intentionally-ordered structures  known as bureaucracies. Weberian bureaucratic organization (Weber 1978: 956–958) implies strict jurisdic - tional areas attached to the worker’s position, identifying their functions and ability to  act. It is constructed as a hierarchy of organizational positions from top to bottom levels,  and it requires special training and focused specialization from the members of the or - ganization. It consists of professionals whose lifelong vocation is bureaucratic work and  thus, their working full-time. It is based on written documents, and it is regulated by  general, objectified rules which do not depend on personal will. The Fordist Modern social organization cannot be imagined without bureaucratic or - ganization. The word “bureaucracy” obtained a negative connotation, although in fact  the above-mentioned mode of organizational governing is rather typical than abnormal  in the modern world. Up to recent times, the bureaucratic organization seemed to prove  its ultimate efficiency as a means of organizing governmental bodies as well as big corpo - rations; it existed as a general pattern of organizing social life. Today, the Weberian bureaucracy as theory and practice come under criticism as rig - id, obsolete, and ineffective. Modern organization under the conditions of late capitalism  is claimed to be more flexible and adaptive to changes. The question is could the Webe - rian bureaucracy still be the key pillar in structuring organizations in the fast-changing,  highly-competitive global world? To see how Weberian bureaucracy has changed in the modern world, we should con - sider the evolution of its elements. It is very important to look at how
world, we should con - sider the evolution of its elements. It is very important to look at how Post-modernity has  influenced classic organizational structures. It is my belief that the phenomenon of bureaucracy cannot be analyzed in isolation  from other theories of social order. Weberian bureaucracy with its strict rules and regula - tions is the embodiment of Foucauldian disciplinary power at the organizational level.  Foucault’s diagrams (Deleuze, 2006), expressing power through systematic relations be - tween humans, objects, and spaces, could be an example of the perfect study of orga - nizational systems. Is there a more colorful representation of classic Weberian bureau - cracy than the diagram of the office space with strict rules, a dress-code, and a chain of  command incarnating certain power relations aimed to discipline and organize obedient  workers in an “objective” structured hierarchy? Moreover, there is also interesting paral - lel between Foucault’s theory of power/knowledge and Weber’s recognition of the role  of information in the bureaucratic administration (Swedeberg, Agevall, 2005). I want  to use the lenses of Foucauldian analysis to demonstrate the relevance of the Weberian  bureaucratic concept in a Modern organizational structure analysis and its modification  in the Post-modern era. While defining bureaucracy, Weber writes that the idea of jurisdictional areas is es - sential for this notion. The bureaucracy is based on the rules, laws, or administrative reg - ulations defining particular activities: “The regular activities required for the purpose of
30 RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 the bureaucratically governed structure are assigned as official duties” (Weber, 1978: 956).  In other words, the regular work done by the organization is recognized, systematized,  and legalized. The jurisdictional area is exactly the legal provision of the actual work to  be done by the organization. This requires the task of creating a system of knowledge  that connects a particular set of work with its legal recognitions. We can assume power- knowledge relations where knowledge produces power, and power constitutes knowledge  (Foucault, 1975: 27–28). According to Foucault, this process of the creation of power and  knowledge structures is parallel, that is, the object becomes a subject of a power relation  at the same time as systematic knowledge is collected. The system of knowledge becomes  the discursive provision for the system of action intended by power. Weber himself spots  this correlation between power and knowledge in establishing a bureaucratic structure:  “Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge.  This is the feature of it that makes it specifically rational. This consists on the one hand in  technical knowledge which, by itself is sufficient to ensure it a position of extraordinary  power. But, in addition to this, bureaucratic organizations, or the holders of power who  make use of them, have the tendency to increase their power still further by the knowl - edge growing out of experience in the service” (Weber, 1925). Thus, Weber’s concept of  bureaucratic knowledge obtained through rational thinking and experience is very simi - lar to the Foucauldian idea of power-knowledge. Knowledge constitutes rules, and rules  determine authority, becoming its source and sine qua non at the same time. The system of rules and regulation provides a system of the distribution of authority  from top-level management to every element of the organization; integer authority is
of authority  from top-level management to every element of the organization; integer authority is  granulated into small pieces, each of which is attributed to every official. The jurisdic - tional areas delimitate these pieces of authority delegated from the entire authority of the  organization as a whole: “The authority to give the commands required for the discharge  of these duties is distributed in a stable way and is strictly delimited by rules concerning  the coercive means, physical, sacerdonal or otherwise, which may be displaced at the  disposal of officials. Methodical provision is made for the regular and continuous fulfil - ment of these duties and for the exercise of the corresponding rights, only persons who  qualify under general rules are employed” (Weber, 1978: 956). The position of the official  in the bureaucracy is defined through rules and rational knowledge. Rational knowledge  gained by professionals determines rules, rules determine duties, and duties determine  activities and the work of the official. The system of empowerment in the bureaucracy  exists through obtaining and imposing certain rational knowledge about what to do and  how to do it. This is exactly what Weber called the “iron cage. ” The Weberian bureaucratic organization is a representation of rational Modern in - dustrial production in non-material sectors such as management, service, and informa - tion production. In this context, we should bear in mind that Weber conducted a detailed  analysis of the genesis of capitalism. His analysis of bureaucracy is the extension of his  research agenda devoted to exploring rationality in Modern society. The triumph of rationality in industrial production was embodied in the Fordist fac - tory with its detailed division of labor, task-specific workplaces, and the explicit system
RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 31 of worker-efficiency regulation. Weberian bureaucracy was an incarnation of the same  principles long before the exquisite Fordist factory saw the light of day. The principles of  the constant rationalization of activities tested in the laboratory conditions of 19th cen - tury European continental bureaucracy were later implemented in highly-competitive  American business. However, it is exactly the rationalized knowledge that was the grounding for both.  In this case, Foucault uses the term of “analytical space” (1975: 143), the space of system - atized knowledge distributed among individuals in the organization according to their  place, status, functions, and other categories. The analytical space overlaps the system - atized knowledge of individuals and objects in the organizational space, thus determin - ing their status. It may be no accident that the typical representation of the repository  of this type of knowledge is the file-cabinet (French bureau ), as the bureaucracy starts  with this systematized information. Furthermore, Weber put it this way: “The manage - ment of modern office is based upon written documents (the ‘files’) .  . . and upon a staff   and subaltern officials and scribes of all sorts. The body of officials working in an agency  along with respective apparatus of material implements and the files makes up a bureau”  (Weber, 1978: 957) The bureaucratic analytical space is organized through the codification and descrip - tion of knowledge in certain forms. This produces a huge amount of instructions, written  orders, and other types of documents which are systematized in this bureau . Weber also  outlines the need to create a specific class of officials providing the work of organization  with the sustaining of this analytical space in order. In Foucauldian terms, they keep  the analytical space, and are authorized to verify its reality with the knowledge from the  analytical space (truth)
and are authorized to verify its reality with the knowledge from the  analytical space (truth) producing knowledge/power. A bureaucracy divides its supreme  authority into particles and uses the written documents verified according to analytical  space by the authorized class of workers to redistribute it among its officials, attributing  predefined jurisdictional areas to each of them. This distribution is settled as a system of  general rules that is obligatory for every member of the bureaucratic organization: “The  management of the office follows general rules, which are more or less stable, more or  less exhaustive, and which can be learned. Knowledge of these rules represents a special  technical expertise which the officials possess” (Weber, 1978: 958). A bureaucracy is constituted from the analytical space provided by power/knowledge,  resulting in general rules and jurisdictional areas of each individual in the organization,  and manifests itself in creating a social superstructure called a hierarchy, that is, the sys - tematization of these officials in a certain order: “The principles of office hierarchy and of  channels of appeal stipulate a clearly established system of super- and sub-ordination in  which there is a supervision of the lower offices by the higher ones. Such a system offers  the governed the possibility of appealing in a precisely regulated manner, the decision of  a lower office to the corresponding superior authority” (Weber, 1978: 957). A hierarchy is an embodied analytical space that distributes individuals in social and  organizational spaces. A hierarchy is important because it identifies who can wield in - fluence on the analytical space in order to change it, and thus change regulations and --- 32 RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 the authority distribution. The highest levels of bureaucratic officials exercise power on  the basis of objectified rules, and could change these rules changing the analytical space  (for example, by issuing orders or regulations). Officials at the middle and lower levels  of hierarchy have to obey these rules, although they can resolve uncertain situations or  situations beyond their jurisdictional area using “channels of appeal” to the highest levels. At the level of the individual official, this results in the creation of detailed profession - al specializations and specified working positions: “When the office is fully developed,  official activity demands the full working capacity of the official, irrespective of the fact  that length of this obligatory working hours in the bureau may be limited” (Weber, 1978:  958). In other words, the specific workplace created in the organizational hierarchy of the  bureaucracy requires training and specialization, and full-time work as a lifelong (or at  least long-term) vocation. As part of a bureaucracy, the specially trained and fully-employed individual alienates  part of his life (the working hours) to the organization in which they work; in the same  way, they alienate part of their personality in the form of their skills and abilities. The bu - reaucrat becomes a werewolf: an official worker of a bureaucracy in daylight and a private  individual at night. This transformation take place in the arena of constantly changing  purposes, focuses, and aims of personal activity. While being an official, the individual  pursues the purposes of the organization in which they are employed; as a private person,  they seek a salary for their work and to pursue their own needs and desires. Inside the bureaucratic organization, the behavior of an individual falls under the  controls of the analytical space. Foucault describes disciplinary control in terms of im - posing
controls of the analytical space. Foucault describes disciplinary control in terms of im - posing time-tables (establishing rhythms, imposing particular occupations, or regulating  the cycles of repetition), the measuring and elaborating of the working activity, and the  correlation of body and gestures resulting in body-object articulation, relations that the  body must have with the object that it manipulates (1975: 149). While the third instru - ment was actively used mostly in Fordist factories with its manual labor, the first two  are the good examples of correlating the analytical space with the practical activity of  bureaucratic workers. The working life of the official is measured and evaluated according to the bureaucratic  norms of working time, while the activities performed during this time are scrupulously  described in special documents referred to their jurisdictional area. In other words, dur - ing any particular day, almost each work-step of a bureaucrat is classified and described  in a set of special documents usually known as job instructions or duty regulations. This is also relevant to job content, because bureaucratic work requires specific skills  obtained through education: “Office management .  .  . usually presupposes thorough  training in a field of specialization. This, too, holds increasingly for the modern executive  and employee of a private enterprise, just as it does for the state of officials” (Weber, 1978:  958). In terms of training, the skills of a bureaucrat are also controlled and measured by  means of the analytical space. To implement their duties, the official should prove to have  certain qualities and skills themselves. The system of the evaluation of an official is also
RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 33 established as part of the analytical space attaching certain qualifications characteristic to  each job position, as well as the instruments to measure them. Thus, the life of the bureaucratic worker is split in two parts, separating their social  and professional life as an official subject, and their private life as a natural person. A bu - reaucracy pretends to rule the first one to be delimitated by working hours and working  duties, while the second is a matter of self-management or household activities aimed  at the reproduction of the individual’s labor potential through the satisfaction of needs.  Let me put this in a way similar to the argument of Giorgio Agamben (1998) about the  constituting of the state apparatus from the rejection of part of human life; the Weberian  bureaucracy separates the individual from its naked life (biological needs and demands)  and rejects the former. In the Weberian bureaucracy, the individual is official and noth - ing more since that is how this objectified inhumane structure works. To be a bureaucrat,  one should do their best to isolate personality to become a part of what Foucault called a  machine, meaning inexorable, rationalized systems of operating reality (1975: 163). To be  an element of the machine, individuals should become an element that may be placed,  moved, or articulated by others; to follow the various chronological series that discipline  must combine to form a composite time of his work; and to be a subject of the precise  system of command (Ibid.: 162–169). All of these qualities described are essential char - acteristics of the Weberian bureaucracy, which is a concrete representation of a social  organizational machine. In the tradition of the Foucauldian method, I should elaborate this theoretical model  by conducting a diagrammatic analysis of bureaucracy. In other words, I should accom - plish the analysis with diagrams, that is, technical and
In other words, I should accom - plish the analysis with diagrams, that is, technical and spatial conditions of the function - ing of bureaucracy. The following description will be as general as possible because it  should cover a general definition of the diagram in private corporations, as well as in  public-sector bodies. The typical diagram of Weberian bureaucracy is of course the office, a space in which  the workplaces of bureaucratic workers are organized with a specific logic, and divided  according to the principle of hierarchy by organizational departments. In the old-fash - ioned bureaucracy, each department has its own separate room while more modern orga - nizations tend to have open spaces. In both cases, the highest levels of the administration  usually have their own offices. The workplace of the bureaucratic worker usually consists  of a table, a chair and a computer, but sometimes with office appliances. The daily respon - sibilities of a bureaucratic worker consist of working with files on the computer and com - municating with colleagues, customers, or suppliers in person and through means of the  telephone and the Internet. For the modern bureaucracy, it is typical to have its workers  be present at the workplace for the entire day, except for officially-restricted work-breaks.  Working duties are planned and described, and work-schedules and tasks are defined  by the line managers. All violations of task deadlines and work routines are treated as  inconsistent with the job. The skills and abilities of bureaucratic workers are evaluated according to a predefined  system of the human-resources management. This special evaluation is imposed to mea -

What is it that makes a bureaucracy a perfect social machine? Based on the arguments  listed above, I could outline two essential premises; the separation of the individual into  two parts, professional and personal, with the rejection of the latter from the workspace,  and the rationalization and structuring of social chaos into a solid organizational order  subjugated to the aim of attaining efficiency and productivity. In the first case, bureaucra - cy generates a specific individual subject, a wholesome professional who has no room for  private affection and thoughts in their mind; in the second case, it develops a wholesome  organization which creates rules and borders to differentiate itself from the external cha - os of the free market unifying professionals in pursuing collective goals. The bureaucracy  thus is rather a specific mode of relation between the organization and the individual in  this context than just a social institution (Maravelias, 2003: 551–552). The theory of bureaucracy has influenced the social and economic theory of organi - zation, and researchers have conducted many studies on the topic: R. K. Merton (1952),  P . M. Blau (1956), E. Jacques (1986), W . A. Niskanen (2007), J. Q. Wilson (1991), P . Evans  and J. E. Rauch (1999), and others. The concept of bureaucracy was found to be relevant  in describing the social structure and consistent pattern of functioning of the organiza - tion. In 1937, in The Nature of the Firm, the famous economist Ronald Coase tried to for - mulate an economic explanation to the question of why firms are organized according to  structural hierarchical principles which are different from free market patterns. Nearly a century after Max Weber’s death, the word “bureaucracy” has, at the same  time, become a synonym for inefficiency, rigidity, the
the word “bureaucracy” has, at the same  time, become a synonym for inefficiency, rigidity, the inability to adapt, and even for in - humanity. Several theoretical and practical attempts have been made to uncrown bureau - cracy and promote different forms of organization. In the public sector, one of the most  notable attempts resulted in the book called Reinventing Government  (Osborne, Gaebler,  1992). The authors, D. Osborne and T. Gaebler, propose to deconstruct the bureaucracy  in the public sector, and reorganizing it according to the principles of the private sector.  According to D. Argyriades (2010), the Osbourne-Gaebler model of decentralization, de - regulation, and the downsizing and outsourcing of the public bureaucracy has strongly  influenced the patterns of managing structural changes in governmental organizations. Private-sector companies began reshaping their organizational structures even earlier.  The concepts of flexible, firm, VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity)  and global network-centric organization and others were focused on possible reforms  of the way organizations are managed. Critics of the Weberian bureaucracy argued that  it is obsolete and belongs to the era of Modernity since we are living in Post-modern  conditions where contracts are short-term, relationships require networking, and struc - tures are flexible. This global and organizational evolution produced a whole variety of  optimistic views representing de-regulative trends, including a shift to more personal  freedom. Indeed, the old-fashioned Weberian bureaucracy with its set of strict rules and re - strictions imposed a professional control over the worker. The analytical space of the
RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 35 workplace controls what should be done by each particular worker, as well as how and  when. The lack of freedom under bureaucratic conditions appears obvious. This is the  reason why Weberian bureaucracy as a concept was opposed by many for decades. The opinion about the bureaucracy as a source of total control without any freedom  nearly represents the Marxist idea of the contradiction between positive and negative  freedom literally. Negative freedom destroys the obstacles and rules which prevent an  individual of doing certain things, while positive freedom is the capacity of the individual  to do certain things. The negative freedom of a supposed de-bureaucratization has its price, which is, para - doxically, positive freedom. Deregulation in corporate and public-sector organizations  means risk-shifting from the government and business to the employee who now be - comes overburdened with the defense of social and labor rights that used to be public ser - vices (for example, this is obvious in the cases of healthcare and labor legislation). To be  disciplined by bureaucratic governing also meant, in a way, to be protected by the same  rules that controlled one’s behavior and, for example, to be able to plan for the future, or  to build a career according to unchanging rules.  Weberian bureaucracy revealed itself when exposed to critical changes in the global  economy, namely the spreading of precarity, flexibility, and uncertainty. To adapt to these  changes, organizations have to be flexible and transform rigid forms into more flexible  forms. As it was stated a century and a half ago by Marx and Engels, “all what is solid  melts into air. ” Bureaucratic structures melt into markets and networks while trying to  adjust to these circumstances (Olsen, 2007). These changes could be understood through the lenses of Foucauldian analysis in  the same manner as I subjected the Weberian bureaucracy to. Foucault did
Foucauldian analysis in  the same manner as I subjected the Weberian bureaucracy to. Foucault did not finish his  work with the concept of disciplinary power. In his later works at the end of 1970s, he pro - posed the new concept of bio-power, or the “care of the self, ” which was further developed  by Gilles Deleuze to become the concept of “control society. ” According to Foucault, the  disciplinary power over actions and behavior a posteriori  during the process of activity  from the 18th century is being replaced by the preventive power over self-control and  self-surveillance. Bio-power is internalized in the norms and representations of the sub - ject, that is, the technologies of the self. The new individual is controlled by themselves  and is not punished with rules and restrictions, but by the risks of being exposed to social  risks of illness, unemployment, poverty, etc. In other words, the regulation is implement - ed in the subject who is now responsible for self-regulation and taking care of themselves. Gille Deleuze elaborated Foucault’s argument in the form of what he called the “control  society” (1992). Unlike the disciplinary society, the society of control aspires to demolish  old barriers and rules. Instead, it provides individuals with the freedom to do whatever  they want. Workers are free from the enclosed workspace, strict rules, uniforms, etc. In - stead, the control society establishes a constant monitoring and tracking of individual  activities. Y ou can do whatever you want, but everything will be monitored and recorded. The process of de-bureaucratization starts with the blurring of the boundary that  separated the professional life of an individual from their personal life. In what is usu -
36 RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 ally called “post-bureaucracy” (Hakan Yuksel, 2016), or network-shaped entrepreneurial  organizations, the individual’s professional and personal lives melt into one perpetual  lifestyle where personal abilities and skills are as important as technical skills, and one has  to mix personal and business contacts to be successful. It is reflected in the widely-used  concept of work-life balance which demonstrates the attempt to re-establish the bound - aries missing between the personal and working lives. The reason for this is the changing nature of labor. Labor becomes immaterial; in  other words, it involves the manipulation of intangible objects, for example, information  (Berardi, 2009). This type of labor does not require complex and expensive means of pro - duction, as most of it can be done by means of electronic devices such as a smartphone or  a laptop. These circumstances change the conditions of the labor process, the alienation  of labor, and management into more flexible ways. Following these trends, modern organizations dismantle the traditional disciplinary  instruments (rules, codes, and regulations), thereby giving room for more flexible and  even (at first sight) democratic inter-organizational relations. Big corporations introduce  flexible working hours, get rid of dress-codes, and detailed corporate rules and formality  in communications. The full working-time that existed in the Weberian bureaucracy as an imminent  characteristic of the workplace was transformed to such an extent that it consumed per - sonal time. To the same degree, one’s personal life is consumed by professional purposes  and career building, subordinating the life of an individual in the pursuit of promotions  and larger salaries. The notion of soft skills (personal psychological characteristics) as a  skill required in the workplace is essential in understanding how the post-bureaucracy  devours private space. This labor
workplace is essential in understanding how the post-bureaucracy  devours private space. This labor “involves the investment of subjectivity” while “[t]he  worker’s personality and subjectivity have to be made susceptible to organization and  command” (Lazzarato, 2012). Flexible working hours spread beyond the standard work - ing time, and force a worker to work overtime, at home or during weekends. The same thing is happening with the typical bureaucratic professional vocation. In - stead of life-long professional individuals who had to adapt to a variety of small tasks and  acquire situational competencies, workers come to be involved in a multitude of flexible  employments, activities, and projects. The umbrella term for such a situation is ‘precari - ous work’ , which reflects the instability and uncertainty in one’s socio-professional status  and employment (Bobkov, Kvachev, 2017). This, of course, implies that training should  become more flexible and task-oriented; the classic scholastic education should be re - placed by lifelong-learning oriented towards exclusively practical aims. The jurisdictional areas in the post-bureaucratic organization became as fuzzy as  working hours and professional status. The new project capitalism (Boltanski, Chiapel - lo, 2017) operates outside the classic division of functions and responsibilities, creating  a mixed space of multi-functional interactions and boundless project teams. The AG - ILE methodology teaches how to reshape organizations in order to increase efficiency  through diffusing the hierarchical order of functions, that is, to do each project with
RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 37 multiple teams, which is faster and results in projects being completed at an improved  level at the same time. In terms of hierarchy, teams are formed to work on each separate project. The post- bureaucracy tends to refuse the classic hierarchy structure of dividing the organization  into departments. Instead, it tries to establish networks which allows for the creation of  teams with members who are in line with the project’s tasks. Detailed techniques of regulating the behavior of the individual no longer exist. In  the workplace, the worker is now relatively more “free” to do whatever they need to do  to attain the desired results. The freedom provided in particular actions is subordinate to  the organizational goal. Additionally, it releases the worker from some out-moded regu - lations such as a dress-code, or from the obligation to sit in front of a computer all day. This all appears as freedom from old bureaucratic restrictions. At the same time, it is  clearly only a negative freedom. The de-regulative lack of positive freedom paradoxically  leads to even more regulations that only now appear as self-control and self-surveillance.  This new networking bureaucracy, being very microscopic (mostly due to novel techno - logical opportunities) and de-regulative at the same time, restructures the power rela - tions in the organization in a way that produces behavior which leads to atomization  and individualization without freedom. This phenomenon needs to be studied using the  Weberian theoretical apparatus. Maravelias argues that the post-bureaucracy “continues  and in certain respects intensifies the process of rationalization of human conduct that  bureaucracy set underway” (2003: 551–552). This rationalization reaches far beyond traditional professional competencies, but  involves personality and individual qualities as well. The influential Harvard Business  Review describes the process of managing network
as well. The influential Harvard Business  Review describes the process of managing network organization in writing that “in a con - nected age we need to instill passion and purpose around a shared mission” (Satell, 2015). Instead of Fordist “docile bodies” (the Foucault formulization) in the networking bu - reaucracy, we have docile mindsets trained to be motivated and indoctrinated with the  corporate culture. The bureaucracy exists not in the formal rules but in the attitudes and  values of workers, manifesting itself as a specific structure of thinking. Instead of the We - berian “iron cage, ” the individual is trapped in the “iron net” which allows the individual  to move freely, but each move entangles the individual more and more. Network organization (or post-bureaucracy) through means of ICT creates systems of  control which are exactly in line with the Deleuzian interpretation of Foucault. The work - er is controlled by CCTV monitoring, a complicated system of PC-surveillance, or digital  access badges designed to monitor the worker’s presence at the work place, etc. Just like  the control society in Deleuze’s theoretical constructs, the post-bureaucracy acquires the  shapes of the control organization. Giving freedoms in the framework of attaining orga - nizational goals imposes massive and scrupulous supervision. These are two major characteristics of the networking bureaucracy. The network, of  course, has been developing since ICT technologies and the Internet provide the op - portunities to develop networking communications and to restructure working activities  through online-platforms and applications. In this case, the networking organization has
38 RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW. 2019. VOL. 18. NO 2 been characterized as “uberized, ” so-called after Uber, which was one of the first compa - nies to introduce such technologies in the management and communication process. As  a result, this process had been called “uberization. ” It is important for the networking bureaucracy to be organized through the means  of ICT. Some researchers argue that this implies not a de-bureaucratization, but a re- bureaucratization (Hodgson 2004), thus reviving principles of the Weberian bureaucracy  in Post-modern conditions. Moreover, ideal types of bureaucracy and post-bureaucracy  are hard to find in real life; for example, empirical study conducted in 2009 identifying  characteristics of bureaucratic and post-bureaucratic workplaces showed that these fea - tures are usually mixed in one organization, or even in one job (Bolin, 2009). Perhaps the final idea of reforming Weberian bureaucracy into a network is not per - sonal freedom (at least, not positive freedom), but the process of increasing the efficiency  of the bureaucratic means of control in the more flexible and fast-changing world. The  famous philosopher Slavoj Žižek who wrote The Puppet and the Dwarf (2003) puts the  problem this way; let us imagine two different fathers; one is the old-fashioned tradi - tionalist who gives his children direct orders of what to do, while the other is a liberal  postmodern father who, without direct orders, convinces the children that they should  do something for their own sake. The latter, even if it is not authoritarian, is much more  dangerous because he tries to manipulate and assure that what you have to do, you have  to do for your own good . This is what is happening with networking bureaucracy; you  do not have to obey strict rules, but, instead, you just have to be compliant to the condi - tions provided in the workplace. In the old-fashioned Weberian bureaucracy, the rules  said that one should correspond to certain
In the old-fashioned Weberian bureaucracy, the rules  said that one should correspond to certain requirements; the networking bureaucracy  provides one with opportunities and if one does not use them, it will lead to bad conse - quences for that individual only. In other words, the networking bureaucracy controls  conditions instead of actions. The concept of human capital (Becker, 1993) is used to transform the bureaucratic  hierarchy and rules into the framework of conditions. According to this concept, each  individual is a holder of their personal human capital, and have to do their best to use it to  create personal income. The purpose of the organization is to provide conditions for each  individual to develop their own capital and for income-generation. This will immediately  lead to mutual benefits for the individual and the organization. However, the creation of conditions implies that if one does not comply with this  framework, it is the individual’s fault, rather than the mismanagement of the organization  or the state. Responsibility for personal actions and even well-being as a result of personal  income shifts from the employer within labour relations to commercial-like networking  relations, being as flexible and precarious as it is possible under modern legal and eco - nomic conditions. Thus, the networking bureaucracy comprehends new, flexible, and innovative means  of control and regulation through the creation of conditions and frameworks. The sepa - ration from formal Weberian principles did not mean de-bureaucratization, but a new  form of the bureaucratization of networks. The complex study of these new forms is yet

От веберовской бюрократии к сетевой бюрократии Вадим Квачев Доцент базовой кафедры ТПП РФ «Развитие человеческого капитала» Российского экономического  университета им. Г. В. Плеханова Адрес: Стремянный пер., д. 36, г. Москва, Российская Федерация 117997 E-mail: kvachevvg@mail.ru  Теория бюрократии Макса Вебера мыслилась как одна из важнейших предпосылок  для формирования современного капитализма. Вплоть до последних десятилетий  предполагалось, что идеальный веберовский тип бюрократии проник во все сферы жизни  и управления, в корпорации и государственное управления и даже является паттерном,  организующим саму современную социальную жизнь. Сегодня веберовскую бюрократию  как теорию и практику постоянно критикуют за жесткость, архаичность и неэффективность.  Современные организации в условиях позднего капитализма претендуют на то, чтобы  быть более гибкими и адаптирующимися к переменам. В настоящей статье обсуждается  возможность концептуализации нового типа бюрократической организации — сетевой  бюрократии. Автор комбинирует фукинианский и веберовский подход к анализу социальной  организации, в частности, то, что Жиль Делёз называл «диаграммами Фуко», то есть  диспозициями людей, вещей и пространств, выражающими
Делёз называл «диаграммами Фуко», то есть  диспозициями людей, вещей и пространств, выражающими отношения власти. Автор  предлагает картину сетевой бюрократии, уходящей от укорененности в дисциплинарной  власти к децентрализованным практикам эпохи позднего капитализма. Сетевая бюрократия  предлагает гибкие инструменты контроля: гибкие рабочие часы, отсутствие жестких правил,  устранение формализма в коммуникациях и рабочем процессе. Однако эта мнимая свобода  дерегулирования оборачивается новой формой контроля. В отличие от классической  веберовской бюрократии, контроль осуществляется посредством делегирования, создание  системы самоконтроля индивидом своей собственной работы через совокупность мер  скрытого паноптического наблюдения: видеокамеры, отслеживание действий сотрудника  за компьютером, контроль времени пребывания на работе через электронные пропуска и  т.п. Эти новые сетевые формы бюрократического контроля предполагают микроконтроль  за действиями работника с помощью новых технологий и таким образом реструктурируют  устаревшие отношения власти, еще сильнее уменьшая пространство личной свободы и  усиливая атомизацию индивида.

El texto "From Weberian Bureaucracy to Networking Bureaucracy" de Vadim Kvachev, académico de la Universidad Rusa de Economía Plekhanov, examina la evolución del concepto de burocracia desde la perspectiva de Max Weber hasta las formas contemporáneas de organización social. A continuación, se presenta un resumen detallado de los puntos clave abordados en el texto.

### Contexto Histórico y Teórico
1. **Burocracia Weberiana**: Max Weber definió la burocracia como una estructura organizativa esencial para la modernidad, especialmente en el contexto del fordismo, donde se consideraba altamente eficiente para gestionar entidades gubernamentales y grandes corporaciones. Weber argumentó que la burocracia fue fundamental para el desarrollo del capitalismo, facilitando la racionalización y sistematización de instituciones y actividades sociales.

2. **Críticas a la Burocracia**: En la actualidad, la burocracia weberiana enfrenta críticas por ser rígida, obsoleta e ineficaz en el contexto del capitalismo tardío, que demanda mayor flexibilidad y adaptabilidad. Se cuestiona si la burocracia puede seguir siendo un pilar clave en la estructuración de organizaciones en un mundo global altamente competitivo.

### Relación entre Burocracia y Poder
3. **Poder Disciplinario**: Kvachev sostiene que la burocracia debe ser entendida en relación con otras teorías del orden social, como las de Michel Foucault, quien analiza las relaciones de poder a través de interacciones sistemáticas. La burocracia, con sus reglas estrictas, encarna este poder disciplinario a nivel organizacional.

4. **Evolución hacia Relaciones Postmodernas**: Con la transición hacia relaciones de poder postmodernas, la burocracia ha evolucionado hacia formas más flexibles y democráticas. Sin embargo, esta desregulación ha llevado a una regulación más intensa, manifestándose en formas de autocontrol y autosurveillance, facilitadas por nuevas tecnologías.

### Transformación de la Burocracia
5. **Burocracia en Red**: Kvachev introduce el concepto de "burocracia en red", caracterizada por su naturaleza microscópica y desreguladora, que promueve comportamientos de atomización e individualización sin otorgar verdadera libertad. Este nuevo modelo se basa en la creación de redes interconectadas en lugar de estructuras jerárquicas rígidas.

6. **Racionalización y Estructura Social**: La racionalización ha transformado la concepción de la sociedad, que ya no se ve como un dominio regido por leyes eternas. En este nuevo marco, los individuos han reestructurado el espacio social hacia burocracias intencionalmente ordenadas.

### Características de la Burocracia Weberiana
7. **Elementos Clave**: La burocracia se caracteriza por áreas de jurisdicción definidas, jerarquía, especialización, documentación escrita y reglas objetivas. Estas características han permitido una gestión más eficiente, aunque también han contribuido a la percepción negativa de la burocracia como rígida e ineficaz.

### Críticas y Relevancia Actual
8. **Desregulación y Libertad**: La desregulación en el sector corporativo y público ha transferido el riesgo a los empleados, quienes deben defender sus derechos laborales. Aunque la desburocratización puede parecer una forma de aumentar la libertad, puede resultar en una pérdida de libertad positiva, ya que los trabajadores se ven sobrecargados con nuevas responsabilidades.

9. **Alienación y Control Disciplinario**: La burocracia también ha generado un proceso de alienación, donde los individuos dedican su vida laboral a la organización, convirtiéndose en "hombres lobo" que actúan como funcionarios durante el día y como individuos privados por la noche.

### Nuevas Dinámicas Laborales
10. **Post-Burocracia**: En el contexto contemporáneo, las organizaciones están adoptando un enfoque más flexible y dinámico, formando equipos de trabajo específicos para cada proyecto. Este cambio permite una mayor rapidez en la ejecución de proyectos, pero también introduce un nuevo tipo de regulación que se manifiesta como auto-control y auto-vigilancia.

11. **Impacto de la Tecnología**: Las tecnologías de la información y la comunicación han facilitado el desarrollo de comunicaciones en red y la reestructuración de las actividades laborales, permitiendo una mayor flexibilidad en el trabajo, pero también un control más sutil y constante sobre los empleados.

### Conclusiones
El texto de Kvachev presenta una crítica profunda a la burocracia weberiana, destacando su evolución hacia una burocracia en red que reconfigura el poder organizacional. Aunque esta nueva forma de organización busca mayor flexibilidad y adaptabilidad, también puede dar lugar a nuevas formas de control y regulación que limitan la libertad real de los individuos. La obra invita a reflexionar sobre la relevancia de la teoría sociológica clásica en la comprensión de los fenómenos sociales actuales, sugiriendo que el legado de Weber sigue siendo clave para desentrañar nuevas formas de control en el contexto contemporáneo.
