Governing methods: policy innovation labs, design and data science in the digital governance of education Ben Williamson∗ School of Education, University of Stirling, Stirling, UK Policy innovation labs are emerging knowledge actors and technical experts in the governing of education. The article offers a historical and conceptualaccount of the organisational form of the policy innovation lab. Policyinnovation labs are characterised by speciﬁc methods and techniques ofdesign, data science, and digitisation in public services such as education.The second half of the article details how labs promote the use of digitaldata analysis, evidence-based evaluation and ‘design-for-policy’ techniquesas methods for the governing of education. In particular, they promotethe ‘computational thinking’ associated with computer programming asa capacity required by a ‘reluctant state’ that is increasingly concernedto delegate its responsibilities to digitally enabled citizens with the‘designerly’ capacities and technical expertise to ‘code’ solutions to publicand social problems. Policy innovation labs are experimental laboratoriestrialling new methods within education for administering and governingthe future of the state itself. Keywords: data; design; digital; governance; innovation; methods; policy innovation labs; technical expertise The involvement of non-state actors in the governance of education has a long history, though the organisational nature of such actors and the ways they locate and promote their own expertise are not stable or transhistorical. Recentresearch has begun to trace the work of, for example, think tanks, philanthro-pies, businesses, consultants, and international organisations as experts in the governing of education (e.g. Saltman 2010 , Grek 2014 , Gunter et al.2014 , Williamson 2014 ). In this article, I identify the current emergence of ‘public and social innovation labs’ (‘psilabs’) in educational governance. These organ-isations go by a number of

organisations have a strong presence, they trend under the hashtag ‘#psilabs’. Policy innovation labs are important emerging knowledge actors in public service redesign. Although ‘social labs’ have existed in some form for a century, as Price ( 2014 , n.p.) points out, the ‘labiﬁcation’ of the policy ﬁeld has rapidly accelerated since 2010, with policy innovation labs ‘applying the principles of scientiﬁc labs – experiment, testing and measurement – to social issues’. The ‘labiﬁcation’ of public and social policy is signiﬁcant,then, in bringing particular scientiﬁc forms of methodological and technical expertise into the policy process, while ostensibly avoiding the politics, values, and ideology of conventional policy-making (Kieboom 2014 ). Despite the global proliferation of labs, their aspirations and methods togovern education are as yet little documented, conceptualised, or understood, an omission this article is intended to address. Speciﬁcally, the article historicises and conceptualises the role of policy innovation labs in educational governance, focusing on labs in the UK.These organisations work through networks, partnerships, alliances, and collab- orations, straddling sectoral borderlines and hybridising resources from acrosspolitical, academic, and media ﬁelds. At the core of their activities is technical expertise in data science, design-based research and digital R&D methods. Policy innovation labs act through data analysis, design methodologies, anddigital resources to promote their ideas, advice, and agendas. In particular,they produce new ‘governing methods’ – methods of experimentation, data science, evidence gathering, and analysis and evaluation – that are intended to ‘know’ and manage educational institutions and individuals, while distantiat-ing themselves from existing political contests. The central argument throughout is that policy innovation labs represent a distinctive approach to the use of emerging techniques, instruments, andmethods
labs represent a distinctive approach to the use of emerging techniques, instruments, andmethods of educational governance. They are redeﬁning the nature of the pro- blems that policy should address, and simultaneously specifying the kinds of solutions appropriate to remedying them. As such, policy innovation labsprovide evidence of how educational governance is increasingly being dis- placed to powerful new knowledge actors from outside of the educational sector. Despite the signiﬁcant growth in the ﬁeld of policy innovation labs,however, little research has so far probed their products or interrogated theinner workings of the ‘laboratory life’ where their insights are produced. Policy network analysis Methodologically, the research comprises a ‘policy network analysis’. This consists of mapping the relations between speciﬁc policy actors and emphasis- ing the contents, interactions, and shared meanings emerging between them(Ball and Junemann 2012 ). The analysis is bounded around a tight network of policy innovation labs mainly located in the UK, and in particular, the keyconnective node Nesta (the UK’s National Endowment for Science,252 B. Williamson
Technology and the Arts), though the actors in this network are each linked with one another in different ways, through different individual relationships, and also traverse a variety of other networks, partnerships, and associations. Ana- lytically, these network relations are interpreted in terms of ‘network govern-ance’, characterised by decentralisation, mobility, ﬂuidity, looseness, complexity, and instability (Ozga et al.2011 ), as well as by the ‘anti-political’ criss-crossing of sectoral borderlines and the hybridisation of ideas, discourses, and materials from bureaucratic, academic, and media ﬁelds (Williamson 2014 ). This shift is symptomatic of what Ball ( 2012 , p. 102) terms the ‘reluctant state’ that is ‘both shufﬂing off old responsibilities and deﬁning and distributing new ones’ to a messy patchwork of outsourced providers, commercial actors,entrepreneurs, philanthropic groups, and a range of other non-state actors. The contribution of this article is to follow and specify the work of policy inno- vation labs in such a reluctant state, focusing on the structure of this network ofpolicy innovation labs, and tracking some aspects of its evolution and social relationships. Practically, this has involved identifying the actors in the network; tracing interorganisational connections and relationships betweenthem; and tracking the development of their particular ideas and methods through texts, documents, events, and online materials. One particular methodological technique adopted to accomplish this form of policy network analysis is that of ‘following the hashtag’. Researchers in science and technology studies have long emphasised the importance of ‘fol- lowing the actors’ in empirical research, including following the work of ‘non-humans’ such as speciﬁc technologies, artefacts, and objects (Latourand Woolgar 1986 ). Such a methodological sensibility is acknowledged as all the more signiﬁcant in the context of social media research, with the
is acknowledged as all the more signiﬁcant in the context of social media research, with the prolifer-ation of technical devices promising a ‘redistribution of methods’ betweenhumans and non-humans (Marres 2012 ). For my own purposes, I have sought to follow the hashtag ‘#psilabs’ in the social media platform Twitter.The hashtag performs the function of gathering a variety of voices, texts, arte-facts, and relations together under a coherent classiﬁcation, which I have then explored in order to identify policy ideas, interorganisational connections and relationships, and to identify documents for closer analysis. While Twitter isused here mainly as a method for identifying actors and locating documents,it also allows a social event to be traced in its ongoing ‘happening’ (Lury and Wakeford 2012 ). As such, an advanced search on Twitter reveals that the hashtag #psilabs was ﬁrst used on 15 February 2014, by Philip Colligan of Nesta, in a Tweet reading‘wonder whether we don’t need a hashtag for tweets on public and social inno- vations labs #psilabs’ (Colligan 2014a ). It was rapidly tweeted and retweeted in the days immediately following, especially with the publication of a Nesta report on policy labs just days later (Mulgan 2014 ). At the time of writing, a year later in February 2015, #psilabs remains a highly active hashtag. A search of activity using the social media analytics site Topsy, for example,Journal of Educational Administration and History 253
reveals 409 tweets containing the hashtag #psilab in the 30 days to 19 February 2015 (excluding retweets and replies). Such analytics provide some sense of psilabs as a ‘happening’ event, and enable us to identify key actors and connec- tions between them, but do not capture the content of such relations. The sub-stantive analysis provided in the rest of this article identiﬁes a tight cluster of organisations and actors associated with the #psilabs hashtag, a set of relation- ships then further explored and thickened through documentary analysis onthese labs’ discursive outputs. Locating policy innovation labs This section provides a historical and conceptual location for policy innovation labs in educational governance, ﬁrst examining their historical formation and then their particular methods, with a particular focus on UK labs. Lab networks One of the ﬁrst indications of what a public policy and social innovation lab might look like was signalled in 2008 by the Innovation Unit. The Innovation Unit is a social enterprise ﬁrst formed within the Department for Education and Skills in 2002 and spun-out as an independent not-for-proﬁt organisation in2006 to innovate in public services. The Innovation Unit is an important actor in the genealogy of policy innovation labs. It originally located the idea of such a lab explicitly in the ﬁeld of education. The Innovation Unit pamphletHonest Brokers: brokering innovation in public services (Horne 2008 ,p .3 ) describes ‘innovation intermediaries’ that ‘have existed in other sectors foryears – such as innovation and science parks, incubators, accelerators,exchanges, labs and studios’ – and asks ‘Where is the Silicon Valley forpublic services in Britain?’ It focuses on emerging ‘brokering organisations that have succeeded in fostering innovation in education’ whose work is charac- terised as affecting the culture of the system to make it more conducive to thedevelopment and spread of innovation (Horne 2008 , p. 4). The
to make it more conducive to thedevelopment and spread of innovation (Horne 2008 , p. 4). The Innovation Unit is itself accurately captured in the idea of the ‘innovation intermediary’ with acapacity for brokering relationships, experimental R&D, and ‘system inﬂuence’in the educational sector. Another Innovation Unit pamphlet, A D&R system for education, similarly draws on ideas about ‘agile methods’ from digital R&D. It proposes ‘an edu-cation R&D system and strategy which is more open and ﬂexible’, involves‘open communities of collaboration’, ‘opportunities for innovation that is both multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary’, and ‘makes the most of user- driven innovation and demand to shape new methods and create knowledge’(Bentley and Gillinson 2007 , p. 19). Examples of such practices given in the report include networked ‘hubs and clusters’ of cross-sectoral relationshipsbetween commercial ICT, university research labs, independent research254 B. Williamson
institutes and think tanks, and policy-makers. Its authors advocate the creation of a ‘National Evidence Centre’ which would ‘synthesize, test and validate evi- dence of effectiveness for new research ﬁndings and methods, and develop and diffuse this knowledge base in direct collaboration with users of that knowl-edge’ (Bentley and Gillinson 2007 , p. 32). The Innovation Unit’s Honest Brokers also describes a ‘Public Services Innovation Laboratory’, to be ‘run by Nesta, in partnership with many existinginnovation intermediaries’: The Laboratory will trial new methods of supporting innovation, search for inno- vation in public services around the world, disseminate lessons to delivery organ-izations, develop training, tools and services for practitioners ..., create an evidence base for what works in social innovation ...[and] become a ‘system inﬂuencer’ campaigning for changes in policy. (Horne 2008 , pp. 33–34) The Public Services Innovation Lab proposed in the report is now a permanent department within Nesta, and it is Nesta in particular that has mobilised the ideaof the public and social innovation lab, both in the UK and through globalnetworks. Formerly a public body established in 1998 by the UK’s New Labour gov- ernment as the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts,Nesta became an independent not-for-proﬁt organisation in 2012 to promote innovation in public services. In 2001, Nesta launched Futurelab, an ‘incubator’ for the design of educational technologies, and perhaps the prototypical policyinnovation lab in the UK (Puttick et al.2014 ). Following Futurelab’s closure in 2010, Nesta developed its own innovation lab (known under different names,including Public Services Innovation Lab, Public Innovation Lab, and morerecently just the Nesta Innovation Lab): Nesta Innovation Lab works with individuals and organisations to generate, develop and test radical new ideas to address social problems. Through develop-ing and applying leading edge
test radical new ideas to address social problems. Through develop-ing and applying leading edge innovation practices and methods, it supports inno-vators in the public, private and social sectors, and links innovative projects toadvocacy and policy change to transform whole systems. (i-teams 2014 ) Nesta Innovation Lab’s cross-cutting topics include ‘data and technology’, ‘open innovation’, ‘digital disruption’, ‘civic engagement’, ‘creative economy’, ‘social good’, ‘Web 2.0’, and ‘transformation’. It has been involved in establish-ing the national network of ‘What Works Centres’ to collect evidence on ‘what works’ in innovation across sectors, primarily through randomised control trials, founded the ‘Alliance for Useful Evidence’ and designed a ‘Standards of Evi-dence Framework’ – a common language for talking about data and evaluation (Mulgan and Puttick 2013 ). As well as establishing its own lab, Nesta has become a signiﬁcant advocate for the ‘labiﬁcation’ of social and public policy, including a monthly digest ofJournal of Educational Administration and History 255
‘Lab Notes’ and a special labs-themed issue of its regular in-house magazine (Price 2014 ). Recent Nesta documentation describes its own Innovation Lab as a prototype for the wider development of ‘social science parks’ and the‘public policy lab’: ‘not so much a think tank but an experimental workshopthat prototypes new forms of public service delivery’ by working across ‘the public, private and social enterprise sectors to create socially useful and usable ideas’ (Nesta 2013a ). Policy labs, it claims, are the XEROX PARC of innovation in social and public policy, while social science parks are its Silicon Valley. The public policy lab extends the role of the think tank into the domain of R&D, with a particular emphasis on innovative experimentaldevelopment, design-based approaches, and the production of evidence anddata of what works in public service reform. In sum, policy innovation labs such as Nesta perform as ‘boundary organiz- ations’ (Grek 2014 ) that straddle sectoral borders and combine elements of activities from different domains and ﬁelds. The lab is an organisational hybrid combining elements of the political think tank, media production, disci- plinary expertise in social and political science, and digital R&D. It works bygathering, balancing, and assembling various institutionalised resources from across the academic, political, and commercial domains, and assembling those resources into unique packages. In this sense, it is paradigmatic ofmore ‘mobile’ and emerging forms of ‘network governance’ that are enactedby policy networks: ‘social mechanisms that can work across social, govern- mental and geographical boundaries’ and ‘build bridges that bring together a diverse range of actors, including governments, businesses and civil society’(McGann and Sabatini 2011 , p. 67). Ultimately, the policy innovation lab is perhaps best deﬁned as an experimental R&D lab for social and public pro-blems, located in the interstitial borderlands between sectors,
R&D lab for social and public pro-blems, located in the interstitial borderlands between sectors, ﬁelds, and disci-plinary methodologies. Lab methods During 2014, the use of the #psilabs hashtag on Twitter became a consistent way of classifying and organising sources related to policy innovation labs, having been suggested by Nesta’s Philip Colligan in February 2014 (Colligan2014b ). As advanced search functionality on Twitter itself reveals, messages containing the hashtag #psilabs were rapidly tweeted and retweeted throughout2014 as Nesta itself published a number of reports fully establishing the idea ofthe public and social innovation lab and detailing its methodologies. Employedmethodologically, following the #psilabs hashtag has revealed Nesta to be a consistent connective hub in this emerging network, both bringing organis- ational ties together and circulating particular methodological commitments.For example, in a report on emerging labs around the world circulated widely through the #psilabs hashtag in February 2014, Nesta chief executive Mulgan ( 2014 ) wrote that ‘social and public labs’ can be characterised256 B. Williamson
particularly by their distinctive methods. These include design methods, such as design ethnography, citizen input, rapid prototyping, and visualisation; tests and evaluations including randomised control trials, such as those proposed by Nesta’s Really Useful Evidence Alliance; psychological and behaviouralexperimentations, such as those developed by the Behavioural Insights Team (known as the government’s ‘Nudge Unit’ it was spun-out in January 2014 as a joint venture between Nesta and the Cabinet Ofﬁce); and digital toolsand data science methods, such as data mining, data analytics, and predictive ‘machine learning’ methods. Just as Nesta has supported the ‘what works’ agenda for policy-making, it has equally supported a post-disciplinary ‘whatworks’ approach to methods by adopting techniques from across the qualitat-ive/quantitative divide and by hybridising digital, data science, and design- oriented methodologies such as user ethnography and user-centred design (Mulgan and Leadbeater 2013 ). Design, data science, and digital R&D methods have become increasingly central to the techniques of government as the work of policy innovation labshas grown. In the last few years, policy labs have been emerging around theworld, as demonstrated in a major report produced by Nesta in collaboration with Bloomberg Philanthropies (the charitable organisation established by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg). The report, entitled i-teams (Puttick et al.2014 ), documents the activities of 20 ‘innovation teams’ from around the world, and is accompanied by a website intended as a global map of such organisations (i-teams 2014 ). Upon its launch, Nesta’s Colligan (2014c ) again sought to mobilise social media support through a Tweet phrased ‘seriously impressed with how #psilabs has taken off as a hashtag –can we do the same with #iteams?’ Some of the labs described in the report are close to government, or even government-led; others are more independentbut at least
the report are close to government, or even government-led; others are more independentbut at least government-enabled. Many combine technological techniques with government services, building on assumptions about growing public interest in collaboration and social engagement and increasing public-sector interest inharnessing digital, data science, and design technologies to public services. Again, the i-teams report emphasises policy innovation labs’ methodologi- cal expertise. Indicatively, one policy lab proﬁled in the report, MindLab wasset up within the Danish government to mobilise methods of experimentation,rapid prototyping, and design methods in public services. Early in 2014, MindLab became an institutional member along with Nesta in the UK and the Governance Lab (GovLab) in New York on a major global programmeentitled Opening Governance (funded by the MacArthur Foundation). Mindlab, GovLab, and Nesta Innovation Lab are all prominent case studiesin the i-teams report. Primarily designed as an initiative to develop innovative methods for government reform, the ambition of Opening Governance is: built around agile and empirical experiments with institutional partners such as governments and NGOs. Experiments are designed to apply and test theJournal of Educational Administration and History 257
latest advances in technology as well as new scientiﬁc insights on collaboration and decision-making to improve real world decision-making in the publicinterest. (Opening Governance 2015 ) Much of the programme is being developed through a network of ‘living labs’ to ‘model’ and ‘test’ new ways of governing. Its aspirations are described interms of ‘smarter governance’ that mobilises ‘crowdsourcing’, ‘open data’, and technology to ‘target’ opportunities for greater ‘public participation’. The Opening Governance initiative demonstrates how policy labs are taking an increasingly signiﬁcant role in the design of governance techniques, methods,and activities, locally, nationally, and globally too. Their governing methods are a hybrid product of data science, design-based research, and digital R&D, taking in laboratory experiments, RCTs, ethnography and, in particular, newdigital forms of data collection, mining, and analytics. In the UK, the policy innovation lab methodology gained political traction in 2014 when the UK Government Cabinet Ofﬁce launched ‘Policy Lab UK’ aspart of its ‘Open Policy Making’ team, a lab at the centre of government. Its ambition is to put digital software and digital data to work deep within the activities of government, particularly in the redesign of public services suchas education, health, and social services. Its Twitter proﬁle claims that Policy Lab UK is ‘bringing new policy techniques to the UK Government, helping design services around people’s experience, using data analytics and newdigital tools’. Its work is all anchored in the trio of ‘digital, data and design’,and enacted through mixed methods of quantitative/computational ‘big data’ and qualitative/ethnographic ‘thick data’ analysis (Siodmok 2014 ). According to its proﬁle on the Nesta i-teams website, Policy Lab UK deploys ‘ethno- graphic research, service blueprinting, data science and digital tools’ as ‘a range of tools and techniques to gain new insights into policy issues’
and digital tools’ as ‘a range of tools and techniques to gain new insights into policy issues’ (i- teams 2014 ). An ‘Open Policy Week’ (organised by the Cabinet Ofﬁce Open Policy Making team) took place in early 2015 to share best practice in open policy-making across government departments, and included the launch of an ‘open policy making toolkit’ based on design, data science, and digitalmethods devised by Policy Lab UK (Nyberg 2015 ). As a key actor in the open policy-making agenda, Policy Lab UK has col- laborated with both the Innovation Unit and the Nesta Innovation Lab. Its direc-tor, a former design entrepreneur, has previously produced materials promoting‘people-powered public services’ and ‘sociable services’ by combining a variety of design and technology-mediated methods of co-design, rapid proto- typing, design ethnography, and citizen entrepreneurship. She has also contrib-uted to a book on ‘design-for-policy’ edited by the founder of MindLab. The book advocates a design-based policy approach. It provides research tools for the ‘policy designer’, from ethnographic, qualitative, user-centred methods torapid prototyping and digital data analysis and visualisation; encourages the ‘co-design’ of policy options between actors in the governance system and258 B. Williamson
its end-users; and argues that design also creates tangible artefacts and deliber- ate user experiences that make services and products desirable (Bason 2014 ). Following the design-for-policy template, Policy Lab UK aims to combineuser experience and digital techniques in the redesign of public services. Lab notes Perhaps the main technique through which these laboratories circulate their ideas and messages is in fact through the device of the Twitter hashtag#psilabs. While the hashtag clearly performs the simple function of enabling Twitter users to search for and follow debates related to policy labs, it also has a more active function. As social media analytics using Topsy indicate,the hashtag #psilabs featured in approximately 100 Tweets per week (not count-ing retweets or replies) through much of 2014 and the ﬁrst two months of 2015. It acts as a mediating device through which the various activities, products, relationships, and conversations of policy innovation labs all ﬂow. Indeed,through the #psilabs hashtag, a vast network of organisations, actors, docu- ments, and resources is brought into alignment and association. In this sense, the hashtag #psilabs performs as an ‘inscription device’, in Latour’s ( 1986 ) terms. As Latour ( 1986 , pp. 27–28) has argued, the power of any technique of inscription – processes that transform reality into texts, ﬁgures, visualisations, graphics, images, or diagrams – is to stabilisecomplex ‘realms of reality’ in one place, ‘just inches apart, once ﬂattened on to the same surface’, so as to measure and modify what is ‘out there’. As such a device, the #psilabs hashtag performs the function of juxtaposing inter-organisational relationships, policy ideas, publications and events and freezinga history of processes and network relations into a (temporarily) stable form in order to exert material effects and consequences in the world. In this regard, the inscription device #psilabs has itself become an important actor in the
world. In this regard, the inscription device #psilabs has itself become an important actor in the stabilis-ation and growth of a network of policy innovation labs and methods, acting as a ‘mediator’ to translate and ﬁx a complex network of associations in one place (Fenwick and Edwards 2010 ). Through the hashtag, the histories and methods of various different organisations and actors (only a tiny sample of which are mapped in the above) are hooked up, interwoven with one another, and stabil- ised as a coherent body of knowledge and practices. Conceptualising policy innovation labs Various methods of knowledge production and circulation are essential to the functioning and inﬂuence of policy innovation labs. Their methodological com- mitments are to digital R&D, data science, and design-based research methodsfor diagnosing policy problems and generating policy insights and solutions. Labs deploy a variety of methods of ‘sociable governance’, such as design- based research, co-production, citizen engagement, user ethnography andJournal of Educational Administration and History 259
co-design, alongside forms of evidence-based evaluation, experimentation, and more digital methods of data science and analysis. Writing on their experimen- tal methods in a special labs-themed issue of Nesta’s in-house magazine, Lead- beater ( 2014 , n.p.) claims that: Labs are places where people conduct experiments to test out theories. The new labs proliferating outside the hard sciences are a symptom of the spread of experi-mentalism as an ideology for how we should shape the future ...it holds that knowledge should develop by being testable and therefore provisional; and thatthe best theories should be designed to be examined by both data and open debate. Lab methods are positioned by this statement unambiguously as part of an ideological project of designing the future. In fact, the entire ‘design-for- policy’ approach adopted by many labs is based on the assumption that design can envision desirable futures and develop ways to makes thosefutures realities (Bason 2014 ). Through these ‘designerly’ methods, policy innovation labs seek to produce the knowledge about citizens that is requiredby those who seek to design the services and interventions to govern them.Such techniques produce ‘governing knowledge’, as educational policy sociologists have termed it, a research-based ‘nervous system’ that allows decisions to be made regarding appropriate governing practices (e.g. Ozgaet al. 2011 ). Indeed, the work of policy innovation labs suggests that their concern is not so much with the production of governing knowledge, but with the production,testing, and reﬁnement of governing methods . The authority of policy inno- vation labs resides in their claims to methodological and technical expertise in digital R&D, data science, and design-for-policy. Many labs are at the fore- front of the use of new digital R&D, data science, and design methods such asrandomised control trials, design thinking, agile methods, user ethnography, and data mining. The forms of technical
trials, design thinking, agile methods, user ethnography, and data mining. The forms of technical expertise behind these methods are challenging the authority of social scientists, whose own expertise is increas-ingly questioned as being ideologically entrenched and theoretically biased, rather than objective, impartial, and evidence-based (Burrows and Savage 2014 ). In this context, methods have taken on a renewed signiﬁcance as tech- niques for making the social world visible, knowable, and thus amenable tointervention. Evidence and data, newly deﬁned through such terms and prac- tices as ‘big data’, ‘data science’, ‘what works’, and ‘design-for-policy’, have become particularly important governing resources. Those organisations withthe technical expertise and methods to generate these data and evidence are thus well positioned as new experts of the social world that can help to shape and structure public policy. Policy innovation labs emphasise the perceived neutrality, objectivity, rigour, and effectiveness of methods and downplay the political values thatunderpin the work that labs do. As Kieboom ( 2014 , p. 26) notes, the methods used by policy innovation labs are presented as ‘a-political’ forms260 B. Williamson
of expertise, and thus that by ‘denying their own political character, they depo- liticize their own roles as political players’. But the way in which labs deﬁne the problems they focus on, and the solutions they design, are fundamentally pol- itical acts. Through policy innovation labs such as Nesta, and the networks itconnects, digital R&D, data science, and design methods are being governmen- talised as a means of knowing and managing individuals and the masses. Policy innovation labs in education Policy innovation labs are important new actors in contemporary governance, but their ideas and aspirations around education are under-researched. This section provides concrete examples of how the governing methods of design- for-policy, digital R&D, and data science are being mobilised, particularly byNesta, in educational settings. It draws critical attention to these actors and their activities as signiﬁcant inﬂuences in the future governing of education. Governing databases In the Innovation Unit report Honest Brokers , Horne ( 2008 , p. 11) articulates a ‘hybrid model’ of innovation in education that continues to inform later policy innovation labs: It is both top-down and bottom-up. This paradigm has been termed ‘disciplined innovation’ in which the effectiveness of innovation at school level is measuredand can be taken to scale, not through central prescription and guidance, butthrough collaborative networks .... This approach is supported and facilitated through ‘middle tier’ organisations delivering programmes that effectivelysupport, foster and discipline innovation at a local level. A key approach of such ‘middle tier’ or intermediary organisations described in the text is the use of sources of digital data. As Horne ( 2008 , p. 14) elaborates: The volume and quality of pupil level data expressing the needs, achievement,and progress of students has grown dramatically in recent years, made partly poss-ible by the declining costs of computer memory and
dramatically in recent years, made partly poss-ible by the declining costs of computer memory and processing power. This is animportant driver. Successful innovation depends upon clear identiﬁcation of pro-blems and the effectiveness of possible solutions ..., neither possible nor visible without efﬁcient measurements of baselines and outcomes. The methods for governing innovation in education articulated in the text pre- ﬁgure and anticipate the ways in which policy innovation labs act both through sociable methods, by mediating between all parties involved in designing the innovation, and through more digital methods of big data collection, mining,and analysis. Nesta’s Innovation Lab has likewise endorsed such methods in its approach to educational innovation. A concrete example is a 2013 report published byJournal of Educational Administration and History 261
Nesta advocating an approach to ‘whole system educational reform’ that com- bines the ‘power of computer technologies’ with evidence of ‘what works’ in pedagogy from the ‘science and art of learning’ and new theories and knowl- edge of ‘system change’ (Fullan and Donnelly 2013 , pp. 9–10). A key aspect of the recommendations offered in the report is that teachers should be supported to become ‘activators’ and ‘change agents’, with ‘students in charge of their own learning under the active guidance of teachers’ (Fullanand Donnelly 2013 , p. 11). The focus on relationships in this new pedagogic formulation, informed by rich sources of data and evidence, is clearly alignedwith both the sociable design-based methods and data-centred approach ofpolicy innovation labs. To this end, the report proposes ‘a comprehensiveindex to be used as an evaluative tool to predict the transformative power of the emerging digital innovations. The index allows us to systematically evaluate new companies, products and school models’ (Fullan and Donnelly 2013 , p. 13). The proposed ‘index’ works by assigning an ‘effectiveness rating’ to individual digital innovations in education in each of the three areas of system change, pedagogy, and technology. The measure of effectiveness in each of these areas is, in turn, informed by a particular set of presuppositions. For example, its measures of pedagogy arebased on ‘cutting edge research evidence’ that emphasise ‘enquiry, constructi-vism and real–world examples’, as well as ‘personalisation’, ‘problem-solving’, and ‘partnership’ (Fullan and Donnelly 2013 , pp. 15–16). As the report notes, ‘innovations should have a theory of learning that is stated expli-citly in the technology, model design, and training of teachers’ (Fullan andDonnelly 2013 , pp. 15–16). Such a theory is implicitly preﬁgured for the user of the index by its in-built assumptions about the pedagogic value of con-structivism, problem-solving, and so on. Despite its rhetoric of
about the pedagogic value of con-structivism, problem-solving, and so on. Despite its rhetoric of objectivity andevidence the report is clearly built upon pre-existing theoretical perspectives that have shaped the way the index has itself been constructed and what it has been designed to measure. As with the work of policy innovation labs more generally, Nesta promotes the use of ‘big data’ and global educational data sets to measure and monitor edu-cational performances. In the Nesta report by Fullan and Donnelly ( 2013 ,p .1 6 ) , the emphasis on data is most clearly exempliﬁed in relation to student assessment: Ideally, the system is completely adaptive, interactive and integrated seamlessly into the innovation. It must be rigorous and accurate and be integral to learner engagement. The assessment results should leverage the techniques of big dataanalysis, data visualisation and international benchmarking of standards. Moreover, the report particularly promotes forms of assessment that are based on emerging real-time data analytics and feedback mechanisms: The next generation of assessments ...should be able to identify features of student behaviour and make observations on it, ...[and] should collect262 B. Williamson
dramatically large and ubiquitous samples of data across users. This data collec- tion should be built into daily activity and used to drive and inform improvementsin the innovation. The analysis of the data into useable, actionable outputs is criti-cal. Additionally, to ensure continuity at the level of the individual student, assess-ments should start with access to the learner’s previous history and data. (Fullanand Donnelly 2013 , p. 17) The digital methods articulated in this example are characteristic of technologi- cal developments often now termed ‘learning analytics’. Sometimes also knownas ‘educational data mining’, learning analytics platforms capture data from learners’ educational activities in order to track, monitor, and assess their devel- opment, their attainment, and their dispositions to learning, in order to then indi-vidually customise and optimise their further educational experience. Beyond the report, Nesta Innovation Lab is an enthusiastic promoter of learning analytics and other automated ‘adaptive learning’ technologies: Adaptive learning technologies use student data to adapt the way information is delivered to a student on an individual level. This data can range from onlinetest scores to session time (how long users spend on a single exercise) torecords of where a user has clicked or touched while ﬁguring out a problem.Based on this feedback, the programme will understand which content to pointthe user at next – planning a personalized learning journey. (Nesta 2013a ) According to Nesta ( 2013b ), these adaptive technologies have potential to provide ‘digital tutors’ that are responsive to learners; and ‘intelligent online platforms’ that can use data gathered from learners to become smart enough to predict, and then appropriately assist and assess, their progression. The Inno- vation Unit likewise endorses learning analytics software that can algorithmi-cally and automatically generate ‘playlists’ of personalised pedagogies for each
can algorithmi-cally and automatically generate ‘playlists’ of personalised pedagogies for each individual learner (Hampson et al. 2012 ). Learning and assessment ana- lytics platforms, such as those promoted by Nesta and the Innovation Unit, are programmed with the capacity to anticipate or predict pupils’ probablefuture progress, and to automate the generation of personalised and pre- emptive pedagogic interventions. For these advocates, data science appears to offer the possibility of a predic- tive, computational theory of education, on the basis of which new kinds of ped-agogic and pastoral interventions can be made. There are risks associated with such techniques. The kind of predictive proﬁling afforded by learning analyticsprovides institutions with actionable intelligence that can be used for various statistical determinations and ‘statistical discrimination’ where ‘individuals are reclassiﬁed in terms of their associations and linkages with others, andthen including/excluding them on the basis of the attributes of the groups and data “segments” that they belong to’ (Selwyn 2015 , p. 74). The ‘robotic algor- ithms’ of learning analytics platforms are able to access spreadsheets of learner data, calculate odds, and make probabilistic predictions, and then automatedecisions about pedagogical intervention in real-time, with ‘the risk that ourJournal of Educational Administration and History 263
predictions may, in the guise of tailoring education to individual learning, actu- ally narrow a person’s educational opportunities to those predetermined by some algorithm’ (Mayer-Scho ¨nberger and Cukier 2014 , n.p.). As these examples indicate, policy innovation labs such as Nesta and the Innovation Unit are enthusiastic advocates of big data and emerging forms of‘digital governance’ that embed digital technologies in the design, organisation, and governing of education. Digital governance puts ‘human-computer inter-action’ and ‘electronic delivery at the heart of the government business model’, and includes activities such as ‘digitizing interactions with citizens’ and ‘new forms of automation using “zero-touch technologies” that do notrequire human intervention’, while also making ‘citizens do more, developingisocratic administration – or do-it-yourself government’ (Margetts and Dun- leavy 2013 , p. 6). In this sense, digital governance is both digitally enabled and data science-based, but also follows the design-for-policy logic of being people-centred, do-it-yourself (DIY), and sociable. Illustratively, Nesta has partnered with the Open Policy Making team in the UK government Cabinet Ofﬁce to explore the idea of ‘a new operating system for government’, andto anticipate how emerging technologies such as ‘data science, predictive ana- lytics, artiﬁcial intelligence, sensors, applied programming interfaces, auton- omous machines, and platforms’ might in the next ﬁve years become‘ingrained into how government thinks of itself’, ‘redeﬁne the role of govern-ment, and even create a different relationship between state and public’ (Maltby 2015 ). Policy innovation labs like Nesta itself are archetypal of such an approach to governance, utilising instruments and techniques that are simul- taneously digitised, data-driven, and design-based. The range of digital tools and data analytics methods utilised by policy inno- vation labs in education constitute new forms of
data analytics methods utilised by policy inno- vation labs in education constitute new forms of what the political sociologistsLascoumes and le Gales ( 2007 ) have termed ‘public policy instruments’. Policy instruments are those technical devices and material techniques that allow par-ticular policy ideas and agendas to be operationalised and realised. But policyinstruments are not simply neutral devices. Instead, ‘every instrument constitu- tes a condensed form of knowledge about social control and ways of exercising it’ and produces ‘speciﬁc effects’ which structure public policy according to itsown logic (Lascoumes and le Gales 2007 , p. 3). Speciﬁc devices such as Nesta’s evaluative index or the adaptive learning analytics platforms they support are digital policy instruments preloaded with assumptions and condensed knowl- edge about the social reality of education that they are designed to measure,and they exercise speciﬁc effects in shaping and structuring decisions about the modiﬁcation of that reality. Learning to code The promise of digital governance that is data science-driven, design-based, and DIY depends on the skills and capacities of human actors to enact it. For policy264 B. Williamson
innovation labs such as Nesta, meeting this promise depends on educating a new generation of citizens as digital, data, and design experts. For this reason, it has enthusiastically endorsed a major agenda around ‘learning to code’ and actively lobbied for the introduction of new computing programmesof study in the National Curriculum in England. In short, through learning to code, young people are to become governable as the digital citizens required to participate in the digital governance of the state. Nesta’s endorsement of learning to code is exempliﬁed in a major initiative launched in 2013. Make Things Do Stuff was established by Nesta InnovationLab, in partnership with the not-for-proﬁt ‘social innovator’ the Nominet Trustand the Internet company Mozilla, to promote various forms of learning tocode, programming, and ‘digital making’. These activities are justiﬁed through a combination of discourses about the powerful role of computer code in the contemporary world and the need of commercial computer compa-nies, as detailed in a Nesta report on ‘young digital makers’ which argues that ‘the movement around digital making is based on the belief that making gives us access to the powerful ideas that help us to understand the world we live in,and to shape it’ (Quinlan 2015 , p. 14). Likewise, the Make Things Do Stuff website states that: ‘In a world where everything from fridges to cars, bankaccounts to medical diagnoses are becoming powered by computing, under-standing how digital technologies are made (and how to make your own) isvital to full participation in society’ (Make Things Do Stuff 2013b ). Make Things Do Stuff is justiﬁed through a cultural argument about producing and not simply consuming technology: Make Things Do Stuff aims to mobilize the next generation of digital makers. We want to help people to make the shift from consuming digital technologies, tomaking and building their own. Because when all kinds of different people start hacking, re-mixing
and building their own. Because when all kinds of different people start hacking, re-mixing and making things with technology, the possibilities get really interesting. Make Things Do Stuff will enable people to ...navigate a path that will take them from being a digital consumer, to being a digitalmaker. (Make Things Do Stuff 2013a ) In particular, Make Things Do Stuff is the product of a concern with citizen- centric forms of co-production, personalisation, and participation in emerging forms of digital governance. In this sense, learning to code and related ‘digital making’ activities are being governmentalised by Nesta and likemindedorganisations as a way of seeking to shape citizen subjectivities and capacities.The subject of learning to code is positioned as a ‘digital citizen’ able to be gov- erned as an active participant in a state increasingly oriented towards digital governance. Learning to code is concerned with the production of individualswho can write the code, design the algorithms, and program the analytics that are required by new forms of data-driven and DIY digital governance. It is underpinned by computational thinking, the expression of problems in thelanguage that computers can understand, and it is such a mode of thinkingJournal of Educational Administration and History 265
which is ultimately promoted by Nesta through Make Things Do Stuff. This is important because assumptions about the value and practices of computational thinking are themselves shaped by social networks of technical experts and the disciplinary and organisational contexts in which they act. As such, throughlearning to code initiatives, people are incited to reorient themselves ‘practically and epistemologically to the demands ...and the principles of computational thinking that underlie them’ (Halford et al.2013 , p. 179). In short, learning to code embodies a set of methodological and epistemological commitmentsand knowledge practices that originate from technical expertise and its embedd- edness in particular disciplinary and organisational contexts. Consequently,through learning to code, people are incited to participate in a system of think-ing associated with the professional regime of computer programming that pri- vileges computational problem-solving, and that emphasises the potential of computer code and algorithms as the solution to many social and publicproblems. The emphasis on learning to code in Make Things Do Stuff is infused with both pedagogical and governing aspirations. As a pedagogy, learning to codeseeks to produce skilled and literate citizen subjects with the computational thinking to participate in new strategies of digital governance. As a governing practice, computational thinking describes an emerging style of politicalthought that assumes many public and social problems can be solved throughdigital innovation. Indeed, these have been combined in learning to code cam- paigns such as Make Things Do Stuff, which assume governance is increasingly to be enacted by citizens themselves who have learned the requisite civiccapacities and technical expertise to participate in the digitised state. This is an emerging form of governance which underpins the work of many policy innovation labs. Nesta documents on ‘coding for civic service’, for
the work of many policy innovation labs. Nesta documents on ‘coding for civic service’, for example,describe a ‘code for xmodel’ where computer code is positioned as the solution to complex government problems (Bell 2014 ). Such ‘civic coding’ initiatives bring together programmers and citizens to work with government ‘opendata’ in order to design new digital services and ‘civic apps’ to improve social and public life or to solve particular government problems. It is a form of what Nesta terms ‘people-powered public services’ enabled by digital tech-nologies (Colligan 2014b ), merging ‘what is (technically) possible and what is (politically) feasible’ (Bell 2014 ). Technical expertise is combined in such initiatives with the everyday ‘lay expertise’ of service users and citizens. In2014, Nesta even ran an ‘Education Open Data Challenge’ involving technicalexperts working with end-users of educational data to design new digital pro- ducts. Organised as a weekend ‘hackathon’, one of the competition winners supported by Nesta is a ‘smart school recommendation engine’ that uses exist-ing data on schools and combines it with individual learning analytics data to produce tailored school recommendations and thus support parents to make informed school choices (Weekes 2014 ). This simultaneously citizen-centric266 B. Williamson
and data-driven approach is paradigmatic of the aspirations of policy innovation labs towards the digital governance of the state. In this sense, learning to code is itself a form of digital policy instrumenta- tion – a technical means of operationalising a particular set of policy ideas andexercising speciﬁc effects in terms of the governance and control of the population. It is a channel through which young people are to be shaped and sculpted with both the civic capacities and technical expertise to become gov-ernable participants in emerging strategies, techniques, and methods of digital governance. Policy innovation laboratory life Policy innovation labs are working to produce new models of how the social world works, and to generate insights that might be addressed by new policydesigns, experimental methods and policy instruments. The style of compu- tational thinking they endorse may well have signiﬁcant consequences for the future social organisation of education. Yet, to date, researchers haveengaged little with the inner workings of such labs or sought to trace the complex work that goes into their projects. This is an important omission. When Latour and Woolgar ( 1986 ) produced their classic sociological account of the work of scientists in Laboratory Life , their conclusion was that scientiﬁc laboratories are deeply complex places where negotiations, arguments, dis-agreements, and compromises are constantly hammered out as scientists seekto construct ‘scientiﬁc facts’, or models of how the world works. While science appears from the outside to be well organised and coherent, Latour and Woolgar ( 1986 , pp. 36–37) argued that on the inside of the laboratory, it is disordered and ‘entails the confrontation and negotiation of utter confusion’.Such disorder and confusion needs to be controlled through the imposition of particular frameworks, methods, and interpretations. Within laboratories, methods are powerful devices that are designed to capture aspects
Within laboratories, methods are powerful devices that are designed to capture aspects of theworld, or particular phenomena, and translate them into formats that are sufﬁ- ciently intelligible for interpretations to be made and explanatory models to be constructed. Published scientiﬁc papers are merely the product or outcome ofsuch methods, arguments, translations, and compromises. But these papers, as inscription devices that freeze such translations, debates, and disagreements into scientiﬁc facts, are important political acts because they construct reality ina particular way. Policy innovation labs, too, are committed to the production of inscriptions that ﬁx reality in particular ways. As my survey of some aspects of the work ofpolicy innovation labs has shown, these labs have become powerful actors inthe production of new methods for making sense of social phenomena. Utilising such techniques and methods as a form of digital policy instrumentation, they ultimately partake in a reconstruction of the social reality of education,Journal of Educational Administration and History 267
redeﬁning the way the educational world works, designing methods to measure it, and producing policy products and recommendations to modify it. As such, these laboratories for experimenting on social and public life require much greater scrutiny as political actors as they gain inﬂuence in the deﬁnition ofpolicy problems and the speciﬁcation of policy solutions. What is ‘laboratory life’ like inside a policy innovation lab, or in a network of labs? What problems do they deﬁne, by what methods? What policy instruments do they design, andwhat are the effects of such instruments on the world out there beyond the lab, its methods, and its publications? How, in particular, are the lab methods of policy innovation labs inﬂuencing the ways in which educational institutionsand individuals are known, understood, and made amenable to interventionand modiﬁcation? New models and methods of governing This article has introduced policy innovation labs as emerging knowledge actors in UK educational governance. As Twitter analytics has revealed, policy innovation labs are a contemporary social ‘happening’: while thehistory of social labs may be a long one, the ‘labiﬁcation’ of public and social policy has consolidated since 2010 and intensiﬁed, in part through the use of the Twitter classiﬁcatory device #psilabs, since 2014. In particular,policy innovation labs operate through building networks and deploying inno- vative methods and instruments to produce new knowledge about the social world and populations to be governed. Policy innovation labs operating inthe ﬁeld of education promote new methods of evidence and data collection and analysis, including design-based research combined with forms of data ana- lytics which act as digital policy instruments and governing methods to exertmaterial effects on the pedagogic routines of the classroom. Such methodsare presented as neutral and anti-political, and yet as the analysis has shown they are deeply political acts that identify
and anti-political, and yet as the analysis has shown they are deeply political acts that identify particular social and public problems and draw support for particular solutions to rectify them. In addition, by pro-moting learning to code, policy innovation labs support particular ideals about computational thinking as a kind of civic capacity of ‘digital citizens’ and a way of solving social and public problems. They are shaping youngpeople as citizens who can participate in, and thus become governable through, emerging strategies of data-based and design-oriented digital governance. As new knowledge actors operating in education, policy innovation labs such as Nesta, and others that cluster under the #psilabs hashtag, are indicative of shifting forms of political governance in the UK. They are laboratories testing and trialling new methods within education as prototypical approachesfor administering and governing the state itself, using social media to share ideas, build alliances, and circulate resources. By combining elements of the work of think tanks, designers, political and social scientiﬁc research, and268 B. Williamson
digital R&D, policy innovation labs are ideally situated to take on some of the work of a ‘reluctant state’ (Ball 2012 ) that intends to deconcentrate and delegate its responsibilities to diverse non-state providers and experts ‘as the primarylocus of response to social problems rather than state intervention’ (Lingardand Sellar 2012 , p. 48). In this sense, policy innovation labs are mobilising their technical and methodological expertise to design experiments and generatedata for shaping the digitised future of the state. Such a state requires individ-uals who possess the requisite technical skills, computational thinking, and designerly capacities to code solutions to contemporary public and social pro- blems. The policy innovation labs traced in this article possess the digital R&D,data science, and design-for-policy ‘governing methods’ required for buildingthe future and sculpting the citizens required of the reluctant state.

Governing methods: policy innovation labs, design and data science in the digital governance of education Ben Williamson∗ School of Education, University of Stirling, Stirling, UK Policy innovation labs are emerging knowledge actors and technical experts in the governing of education. The article offers a historical and conceptualaccount of the organisational form of the policy innovation lab. Policyinnovation labs are characterised by speciﬁc methods and techniques ofdesign, data science, and digitisation in public services such as education.The second half of the article details how labs promote the use of digitaldata analysis, evidence-based evaluation and ‘design-for-policy’ techniquesas methods for the governing of education. In particular, they promotethe ‘computational thinking’ associated with computer programming asa capacity required by a ‘reluctant state’ that is increasingly concernedto delegate its responsibilities to digitally enabled citizens with the‘designerly’ capacities and technical expertise to ‘code’ solutions to publicand social problems. Policy innovation labs are experimental laboratoriestrialling new methods within education for administering and governingthe future of the state itself. Keywords: data; design; digital; governance; innovation; methods; policy innovation labs; technical expertise The involvement of non-state actors in the governance of education has a long history, though the organisational nature of such actors and the ways they locate and promote their own expertise are not stable or transhistorical. Recentresearch has begun to trace the work of, for example, think tanks, philanthro-pies, businesses, consultants, and international organisations as experts in the governing of education (e.g. Saltman 2010 , Grek 2014 , Gunter et al.2014 , Williamson 2014 ).

organisations have a strong presence, they trend under the hashtag ‘#psilabs’. Policy innovation labs are important emerging knowledge actors in public service redesign. Although ‘social labs’ have existed in some form for a century, as Price ( 2014 , n.p.) points out, the ‘labiﬁcation’ of the policy ﬁeld has rapidly accelerated since 2010, with policy innovation labs ‘applying the principles of scientiﬁc labs – experiment, testing and measurement – to social issues’. The ‘labiﬁcation’ of public and social policy is signiﬁcant,then, in bringing particular scientiﬁc forms of methodological and technical expertise into the policy process, while ostensibly avoiding the politics, values, and ideology of conventional policy-making (Kieboom 2014 ). Despite the global proliferation of labs, their aspirations and methods togovern education are as yet little documented, conceptualised, or understood, an omission this article is intended to address. Speciﬁcally, the article historicises and conceptualises the role of policy innovation labs in educational governance, focusing on labs in the UK.These organisations work through networks, partnerships, alliances, and collab- orations, straddling sectoral borderlines and hybridising resources from acrosspolitical, academic, and media ﬁelds. At the core of their activities is technical expertise in data science, design-based research and digital R&D methods. Policy innovation labs act through data analysis, design methodologies, anddigital resources to promote their ideas, advice, and agendas. In particular,they produce new ‘governing methods’ – methods of experimentation, data science, evidence gathering, and analysis and evaluation – that are intended to ‘know’ and manage educational institutions and individuals, while distantiat-ing themselves from existing political contests. The central argument throughout is that policy innovation labs represent a distinctive approach to the use of emerging techniques, instruments, andmethods --- redeﬁning the way the educational world works, designing methods to measure it, and producing policy products and recommendations to modify it. As such, these laboratories for experimenting on social and public life require much greater scrutiny as political actors as they gain inﬂuence in the deﬁnition ofpolicy problems and the speciﬁcation of policy solutions. What is ‘laboratory life’ like inside a policy innovation lab, or in a network of labs? What problems do they deﬁne, by what methods? What policy instruments do they design, andwhat are the effects of such instruments on the world out there beyond the lab, its methods, and its publications? How, in particular, are the lab methods of policy innovation labs inﬂuencing the ways in which educational institutionsand individuals are known, understood, and made amenable to interventionand modiﬁcation? New models and methods of governing This article has introduced policy innovation labs as emerging knowledge actors in UK educational governance. As Twitter analytics has revealed, policy innovation labs are a contemporary social ‘happening’: while thehistory of social labs may be a long one, the ‘labiﬁcation’ of public and social policy has consolidated since 2010 and intensiﬁed, in part through the use of the Twitter classiﬁcatory device #psilabs, since 2014. In particular,policy innovation labs operate through building networks and deploying inno- vative methods and instruments to produce new knowledge about the social world and populations to be governed. Policy innovation labs operating inthe ﬁeld of education promote new methods of evidence and data collection and analysis, including design-based research combined with forms of data ana- lytics which act as digital policy instruments and governing methods to exertmaterial effects on the pedagogic routines of the classroom. Such methodsare presented as neutral and anti-political, and yet as the analysis has shown they are deeply political acts that identify
labs represent a distinctive approach to the use of emerging techniques, instruments, andmethods of educational governance. They are redeﬁning the nature of the pro- blems that policy should address, and simultaneously specifying the kinds of solutions appropriate to remedying them. As such, policy innovation labsprovide evidence of how educational governance is increasingly being dis- placed to powerful new knowledge actors from outside of the educational sector. Despite the signiﬁcant growth in the ﬁeld of policy innovation labs,however, little research has so far probed their products or interrogated theinner workings of the ‘laboratory life’ where their insights are produced. Policy network analysis Methodologically, the research comprises a ‘policy network analysis’. This consists of mapping the relations between speciﬁc policy actors and emphasis- ing the contents, interactions, and shared meanings emerging between them(Ball and Junemann 2012 ). The analysis is bounded around a tight network of policy innovation labs mainly located in the UK, and in particular, the keyconnective node Nesta (the UK’s National Endowment for Science,252 B. Williamson
Technology and the Arts), though the actors in this network are each linked with one another in different ways, through different individual relationships, and also traverse a variety of other networks, partnerships, and associations. Ana- lytically, these network relations are interpreted in terms of ‘network govern-ance’, characterised by decentralisation, mobility, ﬂuidity, looseness, complexity, and instability (Ozga et al.2011 ), as well as by the ‘anti-political’ criss-crossing of sectoral borderlines and the hybridisation of ideas, discourses, and materials from bureaucratic, academic, and media ﬁelds (Williamson 2014 ). This shift is symptomatic of what Ball ( 2012 , p. 102) terms the ‘reluctant state’ that is ‘both shufﬂing off old responsibilities and deﬁning and distributing new ones’ to a messy patchwork of outsourced providers, commercial actors,entrepreneurs, philanthropic groups, and a range of other non-state actors. The contribution of this article is to follow and specify the work of policy inno- vation labs in such a reluctant state, focusing on the structure of this network ofpolicy innovation labs, and tracking some aspects of its evolution and social relationships. Practically, this has involved identifying the actors in the network; tracing interorganisational connections and relationships betweenthem; and tracking the development of their particular ideas and methods through texts, documents, events, and online materials. One particular methodological technique adopted to accomplish this form of policy network analysis is that of ‘following the hashtag’. Researchers in science and technology studies have long emphasised the importance of ‘fol- lowing the actors’ in empirical research, including following the work of ‘non-humans’ such as speciﬁc technologies, artefacts, and objects (Latourand Woolgar 1986 ). Such a methodological sensibility is acknowledged as all the more signiﬁcant in the context of social media research, with the
is acknowledged as all the more signiﬁcant in the context of social media research, with the prolifer-ation of technical devices promising a ‘redistribution of methods’ betweenhumans and non-humans (Marres 2012 ). For my own purposes, I have sought to follow the hashtag ‘#psilabs’ in the social media platform Twitter.The hashtag performs the function of gathering a variety of voices, texts, arte-facts, and relations together under a coherent classiﬁcation, which I have then explored in order to identify policy ideas, interorganisational connections and relationships, and to identify documents for closer analysis. While Twitter isused here mainly as a method for identifying actors and locating documents,it also allows a social event to be traced in its ongoing ‘happening’ (Lury and Wakeford 2012 ). As such, an advanced search on Twitter reveals that the hashtag #psilabs was ﬁrst used on 15 February 2014, by Philip Colligan of Nesta, in a Tweet reading‘wonder whether we don’t need a hashtag for tweets on public and social inno- vations labs #psilabs’ (Colligan 2014a ). It was rapidly tweeted and retweeted in the days immediately following, especially with the publication of a Nesta report on policy labs just days later (Mulgan 2014 ). At the time of writing, a year later in February 2015, #psilabs remains a highly active hashtag. A search of activity using the social media analytics site Topsy, for example,Journal of Educational Administration and History 253 --- reveals 409 tweets containing the hashtag #psilab in the 30 days to 19 February 2015 (excluding retweets and replies). Such analytics provide some sense of psilabs as a ‘happening’ event, and enable us to identify key actors and connec- tions between them, but do not capture the content of such relations. The sub-stantive analysis provided in the rest of this article identiﬁes a tight cluster of organisations and actors associated with the #psilabs hashtag, a set of relation- ships then further explored and thickened through documentary analysis onthese labs’ discursive outputs. Locating policy innovation labs This section provides a historical and conceptual location for policy innovation labs in educational governance, ﬁrst examining their historical formation and then their particular methods, with a particular focus on UK labs. Lab networks One of the ﬁrst indications of what a public policy and social innovation lab might look like was signalled in 2008 by the Innovation Unit. The Innovation Unit is a social enterprise ﬁrst formed within the Department for Education and Skills in 2002 and spun-out as an independent not-for-proﬁt organisation in2006 to innovate in public services. The Innovation Unit is an important actor in the genealogy of policy innovation labs. It originally located the idea of such a lab explicitly in the ﬁeld of education. The Innovation Unit pamphletHonest Brokers: brokering innovation in public services (Horne 2008 ,p .3 ) describes ‘innovation intermediaries’ that ‘have existed in other sectors foryears – such as innovation and science parks, incubators, accelerators,exchanges, labs and studios’ – and asks ‘Where is the Silicon Valley forpublic services in Britain?’ It focuses on emerging ‘brokering organisations that have succeeded in fostering innovation in education’ whose work is charac- terised as affecting the culture of the system to make it more conducive to thedevelopment and spread of innovation (Horne 2008 , p. 4). The --- R&D lab for social and public pro-blems, located in the interstitial borderlands between sectors, ﬁelds, and disci-plinary methodologies. Lab methods During 2014, the use of the #psilabs hashtag on Twitter became a consistent way of classifying and organising sources related to policy innovation labs, having been suggested by Nesta’s Philip Colligan in February 2014 (Colligan2014b ). As advanced search functionality on Twitter itself reveals, messages containing the hashtag #psilabs were rapidly tweeted and retweeted throughout2014 as Nesta itself published a number of reports fully establishing the idea ofthe public and social innovation lab and detailing its methodologies. Employedmethodologically, following the #psilabs hashtag has revealed Nesta to be a consistent connective hub in this emerging network, both bringing organis- ational ties together and circulating particular methodological commitments.For example, in a report on emerging labs around the world circulated widely through the #psilabs hashtag in February 2014, Nesta chief executive Mulgan ( 2014 ) wrote that ‘social and public labs’ can be characterised256 B. Williamson
to make it more conducive to thedevelopment and spread of innovation (Horne 2008 , p. 4). The Innovation Unit is itself accurately captured in the idea of the ‘innovation intermediary’ with acapacity for brokering relationships, experimental R&D, and ‘system inﬂuence’in the educational sector. Another Innovation Unit pamphlet, A D&R system for education, similarly draws on ideas about ‘agile methods’ from digital R&D. It proposes ‘an edu-cation R&D system and strategy which is more open and ﬂexible’, involves‘open communities of collaboration’, ‘opportunities for innovation that is both multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary’, and ‘makes the most of user- driven innovation and demand to shape new methods and create knowledge’(Bentley and Gillinson 2007 , p. 19). Examples of such practices given in the report include networked ‘hubs and clusters’ of cross-sectoral relationshipsbetween commercial ICT, university research labs, independent research254 B. Williamson
institutes and think tanks, and policy-makers. Its authors advocate the creation of a ‘National Evidence Centre’ which would ‘synthesize, test and validate evi- dence of effectiveness for new research ﬁndings and methods, and develop and diffuse this knowledge base in direct collaboration with users of that knowl-edge’ (Bentley and Gillinson 2007 , p. 32). The Innovation Unit’s Honest Brokers also describes a ‘Public Services Innovation Laboratory’, to be ‘run by Nesta, in partnership with many existinginnovation intermediaries’: The Laboratory will trial new methods of supporting innovation, search for inno- vation in public services around the world, disseminate lessons to delivery organ-izations, develop training, tools and services for practitioners ..., create an evidence base for what works in social innovation ...[and] become a ‘system inﬂuencer’ campaigning for changes in policy. (Horne 2008 , pp. 33–34) The Public Services Innovation Lab proposed in the report is now a permanent department within Nesta, and it is Nesta in particular that has mobilised the ideaof the public and social innovation lab, both in the UK and through globalnetworks. Formerly a public body established in 1998 by the UK’s New Labour gov- ernment as the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts,Nesta became an independent not-for-proﬁt organisation in 2012 to promote innovation in public services. In 2001, Nesta launched Futurelab, an ‘incubator’ for the design of educational technologies, and perhaps the prototypical policyinnovation lab in the UK (Puttick et al.2014 ). Following Futurelab’s closure in 2010, Nesta developed its own innovation lab (known under different names,including Public Services Innovation Lab, Public Innovation Lab, and morerecently just the Nesta Innovation Lab): Nesta Innovation Lab works with individuals and organisations to generate, develop and test radical new ideas to address social problems. Through develop-ing and applying leading edge --- ‘Lab Notes’ and a special labs-themed issue of its regular in-house magazine (Price 2014 ). Recent Nesta documentation describes its own Innovation Lab as a prototype for the wider development of ‘social science parks’ and the‘public policy lab’: ‘not so much a think tank but an experimental workshopthat prototypes new forms of public service delivery’ by working across ‘the public, private and social enterprise sectors to create socially useful and usable ideas’ (Nesta 2013a ). Policy labs, it claims, are the XEROX PARC of innovation in social and public policy, while social science parks are its Silicon Valley. The public policy lab extends the role of the think tank into the domain of R&D, with a particular emphasis on innovative experimentaldevelopment, design-based approaches, and the production of evidence anddata of what works in public service reform. In sum, policy innovation labs such as Nesta perform as ‘boundary organiz- ations’ (Grek 2014 ) that straddle sectoral borders and combine elements of activities from different domains and ﬁelds. The lab is an organisational hybrid combining elements of the political think tank, media production, disci- plinary expertise in social and political science, and digital R&D. It works bygathering, balancing, and assembling various institutionalised resources from across the academic, political, and commercial domains, and assembling those resources into unique packages. In this sense, it is paradigmatic ofmore ‘mobile’ and emerging forms of ‘network governance’ that are enactedby policy networks: ‘social mechanisms that can work across social, govern- mental and geographical boundaries’ and ‘build bridges that bring together a diverse range of actors, including governments, businesses and civil society’(McGann and Sabatini 2011 , p. 67). Ultimately, the policy innovation lab is perhaps best deﬁned as an experimental R&D lab for social and public pro-blems, located in the interstitial borderlands between sectors,
test radical new ideas to address social problems. Through develop-ing and applying leading edge innovation practices and methods, it supports inno-vators in the public, private and social sectors, and links innovative projects toadvocacy and policy change to transform whole systems. (i-teams 2014 ) Nesta Innovation Lab’s cross-cutting topics include ‘data and technology’, ‘open innovation’, ‘digital disruption’, ‘civic engagement’, ‘creative economy’, ‘social good’, ‘Web 2.0’, and ‘transformation’. It has been involved in establish-ing the national network of ‘What Works Centres’ to collect evidence on ‘what works’ in innovation across sectors, primarily through randomised control trials, founded the ‘Alliance for Useful Evidence’ and designed a ‘Standards of Evi-dence Framework’ – a common language for talking about data and evaluation (Mulgan and Puttick 2013 ). As well as establishing its own lab, Nesta has become a signiﬁcant advocate for the ‘labiﬁcation’ of social and public policy, including a monthly digest ofJournal of Educational Administration and History 255
particularly by their distinctive methods. These include design methods, such as design ethnography, citizen input, rapid prototyping, and visualisation; tests and evaluations including randomised control trials, such as those proposed by Nesta’s Really Useful Evidence Alliance; psychological and behaviouralexperimentations, such as those developed by the Behavioural Insights Team (known as the government’s ‘Nudge Unit’ it was spun-out in January 2014 as a joint venture between Nesta and the Cabinet Ofﬁce); and digital toolsand data science methods, such as data mining, data analytics, and predictive ‘machine learning’ methods. Just as Nesta has supported the ‘what works’ agenda for policy-making, it has equally supported a post-disciplinary ‘whatworks’ approach to methods by adopting techniques from across the qualitat-ive/quantitative divide and by hybridising digital, data science, and design- oriented methodologies such as user ethnography and user-centred design (Mulgan and Leadbeater 2013 ). Design, data science, and digital R&D methods have become increasingly central to the techniques of government as the work of policy innovation labshas grown. In the last few years, policy labs have been emerging around theworld, as demonstrated in a major report produced by Nesta in collaboration with Bloomberg Philanthropies (the charitable organisation established by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg). The report, entitled i-teams (Puttick et al.2014 ), documents the activities of 20 ‘innovation teams’ from around the world, and is accompanied by a website intended as a global map of such organisations (i-teams 2014 ). Upon its launch, Nesta’s Colligan (2014c ) again sought to mobilise social media support through a Tweet phrased ‘seriously impressed with how #psilabs has taken off as a hashtag –can we do the same with #iteams?’ Some of the labs described in the report are close to government, or even government-led; others are more independentbut at least
the report are close to government, or even government-led; others are more independentbut at least government-enabled. Many combine technological techniques with government services, building on assumptions about growing public interest in collaboration and social engagement and increasing public-sector interest inharnessing digital, data science, and design technologies to public services. Again, the i-teams report emphasises policy innovation labs’ methodologi- cal expertise. Indicatively, one policy lab proﬁled in the report, MindLab wasset up within the Danish government to mobilise methods of experimentation,rapid prototyping, and design methods in public services. Early in 2014, MindLab became an institutional member along with Nesta in the UK and the Governance Lab (GovLab) in New York on a major global programmeentitled Opening Governance (funded by the MacArthur Foundation). Mindlab, GovLab, and Nesta Innovation Lab are all prominent case studiesin the i-teams report. Primarily designed as an initiative to develop innovative methods for government reform, the ambition of Opening Governance is: built around agile and empirical experiments with institutional partners such as governments and NGOs. Experiments are designed to apply and test theJournal of Educational Administration and History 257 --- latest advances in technology as well as new scientiﬁc insights on collaboration and decision-making to improve real world decision-making in the publicinterest. (Opening Governance 2015 ) Much of the programme is being developed through a network of ‘living labs’ to ‘model’ and ‘test’ new ways of governing. Its aspirations are described interms of ‘smarter governance’ that mobilises ‘crowdsourcing’, ‘open data’, and technology to ‘target’ opportunities for greater ‘public participation’. The Opening Governance initiative demonstrates how policy labs are taking an increasingly signiﬁcant role in the design of governance techniques, methods,and activities, locally, nationally, and globally too. Their governing methods are a hybrid product of data science, design-based research, and digital R&D, taking in laboratory experiments, RCTs, ethnography and, in particular, newdigital forms of data collection, mining, and analytics. In the UK, the policy innovation lab methodology gained political traction in 2014 when the UK Government Cabinet Ofﬁce launched ‘Policy Lab UK’ aspart of its ‘Open Policy Making’ team, a lab at the centre of government. Its ambition is to put digital software and digital data to work deep within the activities of government, particularly in the redesign of public services suchas education, health, and social services. Its Twitter proﬁle claims that Policy Lab UK is ‘bringing new policy techniques to the UK Government, helping design services around people’s experience, using data analytics and newdigital tools’. Its work is all anchored in the trio of ‘digital, data and design’,and enacted through mixed methods of quantitative/computational ‘big data’ and qualitative/ethnographic ‘thick data’ analysis (Siodmok 2014 ). According to its proﬁle on the Nesta i-teams website, Policy Lab UK deploys ‘ethno- graphic research, service blueprinting, data science and digital tools’ as ‘a range of tools and techniques to gain new insights into policy issues’ --- and digital tools’ as ‘a range of tools and techniques to gain new insights into policy issues’ (i- teams 2014 ). An ‘Open Policy Week’ (organised by the Cabinet Ofﬁce Open Policy Making team) took place in early 2015 to share best practice in open policy-making across government departments, and included the launch of an ‘open policy making toolkit’ based on design, data science, and digitalmethods devised by Policy Lab UK (Nyberg 2015 ). As a key actor in the open policy-making agenda, Policy Lab UK has col- laborated with both the Innovation Unit and the Nesta Innovation Lab. Its direc-tor, a former design entrepreneur, has previously produced materials promoting‘people-powered public services’ and ‘sociable services’ by combining a variety of design and technology-mediated methods of co-design, rapid proto- typing, design ethnography, and citizen entrepreneurship. She has also contrib-uted to a book on ‘design-for-policy’ edited by the founder of MindLab. The book advocates a design-based policy approach. It provides research tools for the ‘policy designer’, from ethnographic, qualitative, user-centred methods torapid prototyping and digital data analysis and visualisation; encourages the ‘co-design’ of policy options between actors in the governance system and258 B. Williamson
its end-users; and argues that design also creates tangible artefacts and deliber- ate user experiences that make services and products desirable (Bason 2014 ). Following the design-for-policy template, Policy Lab UK aims to combineuser experience and digital techniques in the redesign of public services. Lab notes Perhaps the main technique through which these laboratories circulate their ideas and messages is in fact through the device of the Twitter hashtag#psilabs. While the hashtag clearly performs the simple function of enabling Twitter users to search for and follow debates related to policy labs, it also has a more active function. As social media analytics using Topsy indicate,the hashtag #psilabs featured in approximately 100 Tweets per week (not count-ing retweets or replies) through much of 2014 and the ﬁrst two months of 2015. It acts as a mediating device through which the various activities, products, relationships, and conversations of policy innovation labs all ﬂow. Indeed,through the #psilabs hashtag, a vast network of organisations, actors, docu- ments, and resources is brought into alignment and association. In this sense, the hashtag #psilabs performs as an ‘inscription device’, in Latour’s ( 1986 ) terms. As Latour ( 1986 , pp. 27–28) has argued, the power of any technique of inscription – processes that transform reality into texts, ﬁgures, visualisations, graphics, images, or diagrams – is to stabilisecomplex ‘realms of reality’ in one place, ‘just inches apart, once ﬂattened on to the same surface’, so as to measure and modify what is ‘out there’. As such a device, the #psilabs hashtag performs the function of juxtaposing inter-organisational relationships, policy ideas, publications and events and freezinga history of processes and network relations into a (temporarily) stable form in order to exert material effects and consequences in the world. In this regard, the inscription device #psilabs has itself become an important actor in the
world. In this regard, the inscription device #psilabs has itself become an important actor in the stabilis-ation and growth of a network of policy innovation labs and methods, acting as a ‘mediator’ to translate and ﬁx a complex network of associations in one place (Fenwick and Edwards 2010 ). Through the hashtag, the histories and methods of various different organisations and actors (only a tiny sample of which are mapped in the above) are hooked up, interwoven with one another, and stabil- ised as a coherent body of knowledge and practices. Conceptualising policy innovation labs Various methods of knowledge production and circulation are essential to the functioning and inﬂuence of policy innovation labs. Their methodological com- mitments are to digital R&D, data science, and design-based research methodsfor diagnosing policy problems and generating policy insights and solutions. Labs deploy a variety of methods of ‘sociable governance’, such as design- based research, co-production, citizen engagement, user ethnography andJournal of Educational Administration and History 259
co-design, alongside forms of evidence-based evaluation, experimentation, and more digital methods of data science and analysis. Writing on their experimen- tal methods in a special labs-themed issue of Nesta’s in-house magazine, Lead- beater ( 2014 , n.p.) claims that: Labs are places where people conduct experiments to test out theories. The new labs proliferating outside the hard sciences are a symptom of the spread of experi-mentalism as an ideology for how we should shape the future ...it holds that knowledge should develop by being testable and therefore provisional; and thatthe best theories should be designed to be examined by both data and open debate. Lab methods are positioned by this statement unambiguously as part of an ideological project of designing the future. In fact, the entire ‘design-for- policy’ approach adopted by many labs is based on the assumption that design can envision desirable futures and develop ways to makes thosefutures realities (Bason 2014 ). Through these ‘designerly’ methods, policy innovation labs seek to produce the knowledge about citizens that is requiredby those who seek to design the services and interventions to govern them.Such techniques produce ‘governing knowledge’, as educational policy sociologists have termed it, a research-based ‘nervous system’ that allows decisions to be made regarding appropriate governing practices (e.g. Ozgaet al. 2011 ). Indeed, the work of policy innovation labs suggests that their concern is not so much with the production of governing knowledge, but with the production,testing, and reﬁnement of governing methods . The authority of policy inno- vation labs resides in their claims to methodological and technical expertise in digital R&D, data science, and design-for-policy. Many labs are at the fore- front of the use of new digital R&D, data science, and design methods such asrandomised control trials, design thinking, agile methods, user ethnography, and data mining. The forms of technical --- trials, design thinking, agile methods, user ethnography, and data mining. The forms of technical expertise behind these methods are challenging the authority of social scientists, whose own expertise is increas-ingly questioned as being ideologically entrenched and theoretically biased, rather than objective, impartial, and evidence-based (Burrows and Savage 2014 ). In this context, methods have taken on a renewed signiﬁcance as tech- niques for making the social world visible, knowable, and thus amenable tointervention. Evidence and data, newly deﬁned through such terms and prac- tices as ‘big data’, ‘data science’, ‘what works’, and ‘design-for-policy’, have become particularly important governing resources. Those organisations withthe technical expertise and methods to generate these data and evidence are thus well positioned as new experts of the social world that can help to shape and structure public policy. Policy innovation labs emphasise the perceived neutrality, objectivity, rigour, and effectiveness of methods and downplay the political values thatunderpin the work that labs do. As Kieboom ( 2014 , p. 26) notes, the methods used by policy innovation labs are presented as ‘a-political’ forms260 B. Williamson
of expertise, and thus that by ‘denying their own political character, they depo- liticize their own roles as political players’. But the way in which labs deﬁne the problems they focus on, and the solutions they design, are fundamentally pol- itical acts. Through policy innovation labs such as Nesta, and the networks itconnects, digital R&D, data science, and design methods are being governmen- talised as a means of knowing and managing individuals and the masses. Policy innovation labs in education Policy innovation labs are important new actors in contemporary governance, but their ideas and aspirations around education are under-researched. This section provides concrete examples of how the governing methods of design- for-policy, digital R&D, and data science are being mobilised, particularly byNesta, in educational settings. It draws critical attention to these actors and their activities as signiﬁcant inﬂuences in the future governing of education. Governing databases In the Innovation Unit report Honest Brokers , Horne ( 2008 , p. 11) articulates a ‘hybrid model’ of innovation in education that continues to inform later policy innovation labs: It is both top-down and bottom-up. This paradigm has been termed ‘disciplined innovation’ in which the effectiveness of innovation at school level is measuredand can be taken to scale, not through central prescription and guidance, butthrough collaborative networks .... This approach is supported and facilitated through ‘middle tier’ organisations delivering programmes that effectivelysupport, foster and discipline innovation at a local level. A key approach of such ‘middle tier’ or intermediary organisations described in the text is the use of sources of digital data. As Horne ( 2008 , p. 14) elaborates: The volume and quality of pupil level data expressing the needs, achievement,and progress of students has grown dramatically in recent years, made partly poss-ible by the declining costs of computer memory and --- dramatically in recent years, made partly poss-ible by the declining costs of computer memory and processing power. This is animportant driver. Successful innovation depends upon clear identiﬁcation of pro-blems and the effectiveness of possible solutions ..., neither possible nor visible without efﬁcient measurements of baselines and outcomes. The methods for governing innovation in education articulated in the text pre- ﬁgure and anticipate the ways in which policy innovation labs act both through sociable methods, by mediating between all parties involved in designing the innovation, and through more digital methods of big data collection, mining,and analysis. Nesta’s Innovation Lab has likewise endorsed such methods in its approach to educational innovation. A concrete example is a 2013 report published byJournal of Educational Administration and History 261
Nesta advocating an approach to ‘whole system educational reform’ that com- bines the ‘power of computer technologies’ with evidence of ‘what works’ in pedagogy from the ‘science and art of learning’ and new theories and knowl- edge of ‘system change’ (Fullan and Donnelly 2013 , pp. 9–10). A key aspect of the recommendations offered in the report is that teachers should be supported to become ‘activators’ and ‘change agents’, with ‘students in charge of their own learning under the active guidance of teachers’ (Fullanand Donnelly 2013 , p. 11). The focus on relationships in this new pedagogic formulation, informed by rich sources of data and evidence, is clearly alignedwith both the sociable design-based methods and data-centred approach ofpolicy innovation labs. To this end, the report proposes ‘a comprehensiveindex to be used as an evaluative tool to predict the transformative power of the emerging digital innovations. The index allows us to systematically evaluate new companies, products and school models’ (Fullan and Donnelly 2013 , p. 13). The proposed ‘index’ works by assigning an ‘effectiveness rating’ to individual digital innovations in education in each of the three areas of system change, pedagogy, and technology. The measure of effectiveness in each of these areas is, in turn, informed by a particular set of presuppositions. For example, its measures of pedagogy arebased on ‘cutting edge research evidence’ that emphasise ‘enquiry, constructi-vism and real–world examples’, as well as ‘personalisation’, ‘problem-solving’, and ‘partnership’ (Fullan and Donnelly 2013 , pp. 15–16). As the report notes, ‘innovations should have a theory of learning that is stated expli-citly in the technology, model design, and training of teachers’ (Fullan andDonnelly 2013 , pp. 15–16). Such a theory is implicitly preﬁgured for the user of the index by its in-built assumptions about the pedagogic value of con-structivism, problem-solving, and so on. Despite its rhetoric of --- about the pedagogic value of con-structivism, problem-solving, and so on. Despite its rhetoric of objectivity andevidence the report is clearly built upon pre-existing theoretical perspectives that have shaped the way the index has itself been constructed and what it has been designed to measure. As with the work of policy innovation labs more generally, Nesta promotes the use of ‘big data’ and global educational data sets to measure and monitor edu-cational performances. In the Nesta report by Fullan and Donnelly ( 2013 ,p .1 6 ) , the emphasis on data is most clearly exempliﬁed in relation to student assessment: Ideally, the system is completely adaptive, interactive and integrated seamlessly into the innovation. It must be rigorous and accurate and be integral to learner engagement. The assessment results should leverage the techniques of big dataanalysis, data visualisation and international benchmarking of standards. Moreover, the report particularly promotes forms of assessment that are based on emerging real-time data analytics and feedback mechanisms: The next generation of assessments ...should be able to identify features of student behaviour and make observations on it, ...[and] should collect262 B.

dramatically large and ubiquitous samples of data across users. This data collec- tion should be built into daily activity and used to drive and inform improvementsin the innovation. The analysis of the data into useable, actionable outputs is criti-cal. Additionally, to ensure continuity at the level of the individual student, assess-ments should start with access to the learner’s previous history and data. (Fullanand Donnelly 2013 , p. 17) The digital methods articulated in this example are characteristic of technologi- cal developments often now termed ‘learning analytics’. Sometimes also knownas ‘educational data mining’, learning analytics platforms capture data from learners’ educational activities in order to track, monitor, and assess their devel- opment, their attainment, and their dispositions to learning, in order to then indi-vidually customise and optimise their further educational experience. Beyond the report, Nesta Innovation Lab is an enthusiastic promoter of learning analytics and other automated ‘adaptive learning’ technologies: Adaptive learning technologies use student data to adapt the way information is delivered to a student on an individual level. This data can range from onlinetest scores to session time (how long users spend on a single exercise) torecords of where a user has clicked or touched while ﬁguring out a problem.Based on this feedback, the programme will understand which content to pointthe user at next – planning a personalized learning journey. (Nesta 2013a ) According to Nesta ( 2013b ), these adaptive technologies have potential to provide ‘digital tutors’ that are responsive to learners; and ‘intelligent online platforms’ that can use data gathered from learners to become smart enough to predict, and then appropriately assist and assess, their progression. The Inno- vation Unit likewise endorses learning analytics software that can algorithmi-cally and automatically generate ‘playlists’ of personalised pedagogies for each --- can algorithmi-cally and automatically generate ‘playlists’ of personalised pedagogies for each individual learner (Hampson et al. 2012 ). Learning and assessment ana- lytics platforms, such as those promoted by Nesta and the Innovation Unit, are programmed with the capacity to anticipate or predict pupils’ probablefuture progress, and to automate the generation of personalised and pre- emptive pedagogic interventions. For these advocates, data science appears to offer the possibility of a predic- tive, computational theory of education, on the basis of which new kinds of ped-agogic and pastoral interventions can be made. There are risks associated with such techniques. The kind of predictive proﬁling afforded by learning analyticsprovides institutions with actionable intelligence that can be used for various statistical determinations and ‘statistical discrimination’ where ‘individuals are reclassiﬁed in terms of their associations and linkages with others, andthen including/excluding them on the basis of the attributes of the groups and data “segments” that they belong to’ (Selwyn 2015 , p. 74). The ‘robotic algor- ithms’ of learning analytics platforms are able to access spreadsheets of learner data, calculate odds, and make probabilistic predictions, and then automatedecisions about pedagogical intervention in real-time, with ‘the risk that ourJournal of Educational Administration and History 263
predictions may, in the guise of tailoring education to individual learning, actu- ally narrow a person’s educational opportunities to those predetermined by some algorithm’ (Mayer-Scho ¨nberger and Cukier 2014 , n.p.). As these examples indicate, policy innovation labs such as Nesta and the Innovation Unit are enthusiastic advocates of big data and emerging forms of‘digital governance’ that embed digital technologies in the design, organisation, and governing of education. Digital governance puts ‘human-computer inter-action’ and ‘electronic delivery at the heart of the government business model’, and includes activities such as ‘digitizing interactions with citizens’ and ‘new forms of automation using “zero-touch technologies” that do notrequire human intervention’, while also making ‘citizens do more, developingisocratic administration – or do-it-yourself government’ (Margetts and Dun- leavy 2013 , p. 6). In this sense, digital governance is both digitally enabled and data science-based, but also follows the design-for-policy logic of being people-centred, do-it-yourself (DIY), and sociable. Illustratively, Nesta has partnered with the Open Policy Making team in the UK government Cabinet Ofﬁce to explore the idea of ‘a new operating system for government’, andto anticipate how emerging technologies such as ‘data science, predictive ana- lytics, artiﬁcial intelligence, sensors, applied programming interfaces, auton- omous machines, and platforms’ might in the next ﬁve years become‘ingrained into how government thinks of itself’, ‘redeﬁne the role of govern-ment, and even create a different relationship between state and public’ (Maltby 2015 ). Policy innovation labs like Nesta itself are archetypal of such an approach to governance, utilising instruments and techniques that are simul- taneously digitised, data-driven, and design-based. The range of digital tools and data analytics methods utilised by policy inno- vation labs in education constitute new forms of
data analytics methods utilised by policy inno- vation labs in education constitute new forms of what the political sociologistsLascoumes and le Gales ( 2007 ) have termed ‘public policy instruments’. Policy instruments are those technical devices and material techniques that allow par-ticular policy ideas and agendas to be operationalised and realised. But policyinstruments are not simply neutral devices. Instead, ‘every instrument constitu- tes a condensed form of knowledge about social control and ways of exercising it’ and produces ‘speciﬁc effects’ which structure public policy according to itsown logic (Lascoumes and le Gales 2007 , p. 3). Speciﬁc devices such as Nesta’s evaluative index or the adaptive learning analytics platforms they support are digital policy instruments preloaded with assumptions and condensed knowl- edge about the social reality of education that they are designed to measure,and they exercise speciﬁc effects in shaping and structuring decisions about the modiﬁcation of that reality. Learning to code The promise of digital governance that is data science-driven, design-based, and DIY depends on the skills and capacities of human actors to enact it. For policy264 B. Williamson
innovation labs such as Nesta, meeting this promise depends on educating a new generation of citizens as digital, data, and design experts. For this reason, it has enthusiastically endorsed a major agenda around ‘learning to code’ and actively lobbied for the introduction of new computing programmesof study in the National Curriculum in England. In short, through learning to code, young people are to become governable as the digital citizens required to participate in the digital governance of the state. Nesta’s endorsement of learning to code is exempliﬁed in a major initiative launched in 2013. Make Things Do Stuff was established by Nesta InnovationLab, in partnership with the not-for-proﬁt ‘social innovator’ the Nominet Trustand the Internet company Mozilla, to promote various forms of learning tocode, programming, and ‘digital making’. These activities are justiﬁed through a combination of discourses about the powerful role of computer code in the contemporary world and the need of commercial computer compa-nies, as detailed in a Nesta report on ‘young digital makers’ which argues that ‘the movement around digital making is based on the belief that making gives us access to the powerful ideas that help us to understand the world we live in,and to shape it’ (Quinlan 2015 , p. 14). Likewise, the Make Things Do Stuff website states that: ‘In a world where everything from fridges to cars, bankaccounts to medical diagnoses are becoming powered by computing, under-standing how digital technologies are made (and how to make your own) isvital to full participation in society’ (Make Things Do Stuff 2013b ). Make Things Do Stuff is justiﬁed through a cultural argument about producing and not simply consuming technology: Make Things Do Stuff aims to mobilize the next generation of digital makers. We want to help people to make the shift from consuming digital technologies, tomaking and building their own. Because when all kinds of different people start hacking, re-mixing --- and building their own. Because when all kinds of different people start hacking, re-mixing and making things with technology, the possibilities get really interesting. Make Things Do Stuff will enable people to ...navigate a path that will take them from being a digital consumer, to being a digitalmaker. (Make Things Do Stuff 2013a ) In particular, Make Things Do Stuff is the product of a concern with citizen- centric forms of co-production, personalisation, and participation in emerging forms of digital governance. In this sense, learning to code and related ‘digital making’ activities are being governmentalised by Nesta and likemindedorganisations as a way of seeking to shape citizen subjectivities and capacities.The subject of learning to code is positioned as a ‘digital citizen’ able to be gov- erned as an active participant in a state increasingly oriented towards digital governance. Learning to code is concerned with the production of individualswho can write the code, design the algorithms, and program the analytics that are required by new forms of data-driven and DIY digital governance. It is underpinned by computational thinking, the expression of problems in thelanguage that computers can understand, and it is such a mode of thinkingJournal of Educational Administration and History 265 --- which is ultimately promoted by Nesta through Make Things Do Stuff. This is important because assumptions about the value and practices of computational thinking are themselves shaped by social networks of technical experts and the disciplinary and organisational contexts in which they act. As such, throughlearning to code initiatives, people are incited to reorient themselves ‘practically and epistemologically to the demands ...and the principles of computational thinking that underlie them’ (Halford et al.2013 , p. 179). In short, learning to code embodies a set of methodological and epistemological commitmentsand knowledge practices that originate from technical expertise and its embedd- edness in particular disciplinary and organisational contexts. Consequently,through learning to code, people are incited to participate in a system of think-ing associated with the professional regime of computer programming that pri- vileges computational problem-solving, and that emphasises the potential of computer code and algorithms as the solution to many social and publicproblems. The emphasis on learning to code in Make Things Do Stuff is infused with both pedagogical and governing aspirations. As a pedagogy, learning to codeseeks to produce skilled and literate citizen subjects with the computational thinking to participate in new strategies of digital governance. As a governing practice, computational thinking describes an emerging style of politicalthought that assumes many public and social problems can be solved throughdigital innovation. Indeed, these have been combined in learning to code cam- paigns such as Make Things Do Stuff, which assume governance is increasingly to be enacted by citizens themselves who have learned the requisite civiccapacities and technical expertise to participate in the digitised state. This is an emerging form of governance which underpins the work of many policy innovation labs. Nesta documents on ‘coding for civic service’, for
the work of many policy innovation labs. Nesta documents on ‘coding for civic service’, for example,describe a ‘code for xmodel’ where computer code is positioned as the solution to complex government problems (Bell 2014 ). Such ‘civic coding’ initiatives bring together programmers and citizens to work with government ‘opendata’ in order to design new digital services and ‘civic apps’ to improve social and public life or to solve particular government problems. It is a form of what Nesta terms ‘people-powered public services’ enabled by digital tech-nologies (Colligan 2014b ), merging ‘what is (technically) possible and what is (politically) feasible’ (Bell 2014 ). Technical expertise is combined in such initiatives with the everyday ‘lay expertise’ of service users and citizens. In2014, Nesta even ran an ‘Education Open Data Challenge’ involving technicalexperts working with end-users of educational data to design new digital pro- ducts. Organised as a weekend ‘hackathon’, one of the competition winners supported by Nesta is a ‘smart school recommendation engine’ that uses exist-ing data on schools and combines it with individual learning analytics data to produce tailored school recommendations and thus support parents to make informed school choices (Weekes 2014 ). This simultaneously citizen-centric266 B. Williamson
and data-driven approach is paradigmatic of the aspirations of policy innovation labs towards the digital governance of the state. In this sense, learning to code is itself a form of digital policy instrumenta- tion – a technical means of operationalising a particular set of policy ideas andexercising speciﬁc effects in terms of the governance and control of the population. It is a channel through which young people are to be shaped and sculpted with both the civic capacities and technical expertise to become gov-ernable participants in emerging strategies, techniques, and methods of digital governance. Policy innovation laboratory life Policy innovation labs are working to produce new models of how the social world works, and to generate insights that might be addressed by new policydesigns, experimental methods and policy instruments. The style of compu- tational thinking they endorse may well have signiﬁcant consequences for the future social organisation of education. Yet, to date, researchers haveengaged little with the inner workings of such labs or sought to trace the complex work that goes into their projects. This is an important omission. When Latour and Woolgar ( 1986 ) produced their classic sociological account of the work of scientists in Laboratory Life , their conclusion was that scientiﬁc laboratories are deeply complex places where negotiations, arguments, dis-agreements, and compromises are constantly hammered out as scientists seekto construct ‘scientiﬁc facts’, or models of how the world works. While science appears from the outside to be well organised and coherent, Latour and Woolgar ( 1986 , pp. 36–37) argued that on the inside of the laboratory, it is disordered and ‘entails the confrontation and negotiation of utter confusion’.Such disorder and confusion needs to be controlled through the imposition of particular frameworks, methods, and interpretations. Within laboratories, methods are powerful devices that are designed to capture aspects
Within laboratories, methods are powerful devices that are designed to capture aspects of theworld, or particular phenomena, and translate them into formats that are sufﬁ- ciently intelligible for interpretations to be made and explanatory models to be constructed. Published scientiﬁc papers are merely the product or outcome ofsuch methods, arguments, translations, and compromises. But these papers, as inscription devices that freeze such translations, debates, and disagreements into scientiﬁc facts, are important political acts because they construct reality ina particular way. Policy innovation labs, too, are committed to the production of inscriptions that ﬁx reality in particular ways. As my survey of some aspects of the work ofpolicy innovation labs has shown, these labs have become powerful actors inthe production of new methods for making sense of social phenomena. Utilising such techniques and methods as a form of digital policy instrumentation, they ultimately partake in a reconstruction of the social reality of education,Journal of Educational Administration and History 267 --- the construction of scientiﬁc facts.

and anti-political, and yet as the analysis has shown they are deeply political acts that identify particular social and public problems and draw support for particular solutions to rectify them. In addition, by pro-moting learning to code, policy innovation labs support particular ideals about computational thinking as a kind of civic capacity of ‘digital citizens’ and a way of solving social and public problems. They are shaping youngpeople as citizens who can participate in, and thus become governable through, emerging strategies of data-based and design-oriented digital governance. As new knowledge actors operating in education, policy innovation labs such as Nesta, and others that cluster under the #psilabs hashtag, are indicative of shifting forms of political governance in the UK. They are laboratories testing and trialling new methods within education as prototypical approachesfor administering and governing the state itself, using social media to share ideas, build alliances, and circulate resources. By combining elements of the work of think tanks, designers, political and social scientiﬁc research, and268 B. Williamson
digital R&D, policy innovation labs are ideally situated to take on some of the work of a ‘reluctant state’ (Ball 2012 ) that intends to deconcentrate and delegate its responsibilities to diverse non-state providers and experts ‘as the primarylocus of response to social problems rather than state intervention’ (Lingardand Sellar 2012 , p. 48). In this sense, policy innovation labs are mobilising their technical and methodological expertise to design experiments and generatedata for shaping the digitised future of the state. Such a state requires individ-uals who possess the requisite technical skills, computational thinking, and designerly capacities to code solutions to contemporary public and social pro- blems. The policy innovation labs traced in this article possess the digital R&D,data science, and design-for-policy ‘governing methods’ required for buildingthe future and sculpting the citizens required of the reluctant state.
